Unfortunately, I did not discover this until I was in the tub. Enough \"grit\" was left undissolved where I ended up in pain; it scratched my hind quarters so badly that I was actually bleeding in a few spots. Needless to say, the pain I felt from the mustard bath water, on my scratches (and few cuts, to be honest) was immense. Later that night I had to resort to having my husband apply Vitamin E to my scratches -just so I could get some relief. The next day, I am still in pain.\n\nI'm not sure what went wrong. My bath water was sufficiently hot enough to dissolve the mustard bath. I used it one other time, with no issues. However, I am NEVER going to use this, in my bath, again. Interestingly enough, the product packaging contained no warnings, whatsoever. In hindsight, I find that strange.\n\nIf you must use it, my recommendation is to use it for a foot soak, only.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was looking for a dual-purpose rose water and I have realized, after the fact, that what I really need is a true hydrosol. Since I read the consistently high ratings for this brand at the time, though, and the budget friendly price, I decided to go with this one. I received it yesterday and used it last night in my face cleaning routine. The smell is okay. Maybe I just don't like roses as much as the next person. It was by no means offensive, but I personally wouldn't want to wear a perfume that smelled like this. I transferred this into a fine-mist spray bottle and spritzed it on after cleaning my face and neck and applying Hyaluronic Acid, and before my moisturizer. Since I have several steps in fighting the melasma, wrinkles, and adult acne, my face gets dry by the time I'm ready to put on my moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use it, as it does seem to keep the dryness at bay while I go through my routine. It is refreshing on the skin and I had no negative reaction to it.\nFor the dual-purpose part: I had Lasik eye surgery 10 years ago and I've been suffering from extremely dry eyes for about two years. I wanted something without all the synthetic ingredients that all the OTC drops have. Many people have commented that rose water drops are very good for dry eyes. Turns out, this rose water is just distilled water with rose essential oil added. I need to do some further research, but I don't think this is going to work. For skin moisturizing purposes, though, it's fits the bill.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This item is great if you want to trim short hair cuts, good value for a great price. Lots of accessories, even a nose hair trimer! BUT... MAKE SURE YOU CHARGE IT COMPLETELY BEFORE USE! I thought that if I used it with the power adapter, it would cut even if it was not fully charged. Fact is that, even if you have the power adapter plugged in to the wall, if it is not fully charged you will NOT be able to cut. This sux if you are in the middle of a haircut and you run out of juice. (happened to me) and so I had to wait with hair patches till the thing was charged again to be able to finish the cut. Maybe I should have read the instructions, but I've had other rechargable battery clippers in the past and as long as you had it plugged it would work even if it was not fully charged.\n\nThis is a big flaw for me and that's why I take away 2 stars. Other than that the machine is great, Cipper sizes are very good, stable, convenient/all in one. Good product that could be better if the battery/power options were improved.", "label": 2}
{"text": "This thing is a piece of junk.  The rubber bottom, while it helps to keep the unit from sliding around, has the added caveat of remaining wet for a long period of time after a shave.  How do you dry it?  I don't know.  Perhaps by turning it on its side until it air dries.  In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out, but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and, worse, spreading.  Legionnaire's, anyone?", "label": 0}
{"text": "Before I purchased this item, I read the mostly favorable reviews and got pretty excited, but for around $35.00 I was cautiously optimistic.  After charging the unit I tried it out for the first time, and found it took some time to get used to, for two reasons.\n1. Getting the angle right so it trims well is tricky\n2. Getting comfortable using a device that looks like this around your private areas is unsettling initially, but I've used it 3 times now and haven't had a nick or cut yet.\n\nThis product does what its name implies, it \"grooms\" you, it doesn't shave you.  What I mean by this is, you will get a much closer shave by using a manual (facial) razor and shaving cream/gel.\n\nIt does feel sturdy, however the head can be a little large for getting certain areas.  All in all a nice unit, but don't expect a straight-edge shave with it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Here is an update from Nov. 2015 -\n\nUnfortunately, it applies to the seller of this product, not to the product itself. I bought it at the beginning of October, and now 5 weeks later it still has not arrived from the UK to LA, CA. No tracking info, nothing to do about it, but to ask for a refund and never buy again.\n\nI purchased this product for the first time only recently, after doing some online research. I was looking for a healthy alternative to a brand that I used for almost a decade. I have about 20% gray hair, more so on my temples, and my natural hair color is dark brown. The Medium Brown 4N by Tints of Nature seemed to be the best match, so I gave it a try. I had nothing to lose but gray hair.\n\nWhen I got the package, I read everything on the box and in the instructions, just to make sure I'm not missing any warning, as we all know, these things always come with all sorts of warnings. Though, I did not do the allergy test 48 hrs ahead as I never had any allergy issues before, even with brands that are known to be less safe. And I did not regret it, because I had no issues at all. It's been now 5 days since I used it and I am completely fine.\n\nAs for the product, I instantly liked it. The color smells very nice, it does not have the typical chemical/toxic smell to it, and I did not even have to turn on the fan in my bathroom. The preparation time is just as with any other brand, as there are two bottles that need to be mixed well, and you are good to start with your journey. The mixed color paste is just thick enough that it does not drip from your hair, and still, you can run your comb through your hair if you need to. I also like that it is made of the certified organic ingredients, and that it has the least amount of the toxic ingredients, which they have to use in order for it to fully cover your gray hair. Be aware that this is not a 100% non-toxic/organic product, however, it is the least toxic permanent hair color that I could find on the market.\n\nIn addition, it is made in the UK, and to my knowledge, they need to comply with the much stricter EU safety standards, unlike US manufacturers. That fact alone gives me a piece of mind, as FDA has not changed their laws about the beauty products and their safety since the 70s.\n\nAnd the most important thing, the hair color came out beautifully. It has a warm tone of the dark brown shade, and it fully covered all my grays. My hair looks shiny and natural. The gray portion got a very slight tint of a dark brown with golden undertones, but they are still very well covered. No one would be able to tell that those were gray hairs at some point. The previous brand that I used to use would give me a very dark brown with black undertone, and it was a bit too dark. I love this product, it is the safest I could find, its packaging is made out of recycled materials, and they use organic ingredients, among other things.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is its price. It is about double of what other similar products cost and I have not seen it in any store in CA. Which means, there is shipping time to include in your wait, so I am about to order myself another box.\n\nI highly recommend this brand, and this is after using hair colors on and off for about past 20 years. I started experimenting in my teens, and by now I consider myself an amateur-pro, if there is such a thing.", "label": 0}

The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.

{"text": "I read several reviews before buying the product and there are people who absolutely love it and those who swear wouldn't buy again. I'll try to be as objective as possible...\n\nEffectiveness:\n\nThe product works. It whitens my teeth after the first use, and the result became very obvious after 3 uses (as it claims), so I'm pretty satisfied.\n\nTray Design:\n\nThe tray fits my mouth quite well (but I have a small mouth... I even wonder how it would fit bigger mouth since the tray is kinda small.) Spreading the gel so that it fully covers the teeth isn't easy. I noticed that the top part of the teeth are whiter than the bottom (especially the bottom teeth.)\n\nSide Effect:\n\nThe gel DOES hurt the gum. I read other reviews and people have been complaining about bleached gum. My gum didn't get bleached, it didn't turn white, but it bled!!! The part of the gum closest to the teeth turned red because of the bleeding and there's also minor peeling of the gum too. It hurt pretty bad when I brushed my teeth. The bleeding only happened the first two times... I guess my gum got used to the gel since it didn't bleed after the third time (however, still hurt a little.)\n\nBottom line:\n\nIt does the job. It whitens your teeth, but comes with a price... hurts your gum!\n\nSo, here's what I do:\n\nThe first two trays I used them two days in a row (like the instruction says) and on the second day, it's really painful on the gum. So I waited one day before doing the third one and my gum didn't hurt as much. I would suggest using it every other day (or you can try two days between use)... I think it helps with the tooth sensitivity (which I didn't experience as much as when I used the Crest White strip) and the painful gum.\n\nI hope this helps.", "label": 2}

{"text": "It works well for short, fine hair in just one sweep.  It takes a little more effort for anything else.  A small amount of hair clogs up the razor cutting edge pretty quickly, but it can be easily washed out with water. The overall benefit of this probably is that it does not cut off more than you want at any one sweep. The dual sided cutting head is a great advantage since it avoids a lot of contortion to get both sides of your body. It's a bit more expensive than other similar grooming razors.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Don't use this product. I used it in Nov 2016 and had a burning sensation. Because the look was so nice I used it again in Jan 2017. I had a severve allergic reaction to PPD.

Went to my doctor he told me I burnt my scalp. Still couldn't figure out what did it. I went back to Natural Grocers where I bought the product and they had no clue, no education. My mother researched the product and PPD is used in products that claim they are organic. It is a dangerous chemical. It broke down my immune system and burnt my hair follicles. Within a month I am bald. I went from nice thick hair to close to 75% bald and still shedding. It's close to 2 months and my scalp still burns. My hair slowly  fell out and then came out in clumps in the shower. We started researching. PPD is a petroleum and use in oil and gas. To make tires... look it up, it falls under several chemical names.", "label": 0}
