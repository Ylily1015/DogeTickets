I am disappointed that what was a simple Norelco shaver now has so many features that it is impossible to tell the better ones from the standard ones, except for prices differences.  When I look on the web (Amazon and Norelco) it would be great if there was a side-by-side chart comparing all the fetures of all the Norelco shavers.  That would do a lot to help customers sort out which features and prices range work the best for them.

After using it for a month, I have determined the following:  PRO's - It is designed to fit the hand well and the flip-type head simplifies cleaning.  CON's - No sliding scale indicator to show state of charge.  Runs at a relatively slow speed with slower shaving time. Bulky external transformer at end of charging cord.

The vacuum is a waste of money, it keeps getting clogged so you have to take it apart two or three times during trimming to keep it working. DON'T take apart the vacuum too much to clean as the spring inside is loose and it ended up in the trap of my sink. And finally forget the settings. I start off with a three setting for example and notice some of my beard is shorter than other parts and look at the settings and somehow the thing has slipped to #2. So then you do a 2 only to find out it has slipped again to 1. If you want a laugh buy this thing but if you want a trim don't buy it.

{"text": "This thing cut me up a bit... not as bad as previous electric trimmers/razors I tried, but it's not quite as suited to \"sensitive areas\" as they say.  The problem is the top and bottom trimmer blades (the ones that are not under the foil) catch your skin (even when you're trying to hold it taut), especially in concave areas.  There needs to be a way to turn them off independently of the blades under the foil, and/or the teeth should be much finer (like the little \"finishing touch\" shavers) so your skin won't slip in between the teeth.\n\nThe blades under the foil did not irritate my skin and they made a pretty close shave.\n\nBattery: There is no battery meter, and you're not supposed to leave it in the charger 24/7 (because it's NiMH), so there are issues not having enough charge to finish the job (until the next day after you charge it). I'd actually rather just have a NiCd battery for this application (because you can leave them in the charger 24/7, like a Sonicare toothbrush, and it won't hurt the battery life).\n\nFor the price this is a decent shaver...

While this product does contain vitamins A (retinol), E (tocopherol) , & C (ascorbyl palmitate) in a form that can be used by the skin (many other skin products do not) it also contains many hazardous ingredients, especially for acne suffers like fats, fatty acids, cholesterol, wax, and silicone oils; these ingredients will moisturize but also clog pores, make skin shiny, and may give people milia. In addition to this it contains trithanolamine a pH balancing ingredient that has been linked to cancer among many other health problems.\n\nRetinol, a form of vitamin A is less stable, and less potent than prescription Vitamin A products, and could be less irritating to some but still has the potential to cause serious skin irritation. However even if Afirm had no Vitamin A, the other ingredients here including the additives that are meant to stabilize the retinol and prevent it from breaking down before it gets on your skin, are enough to cause serious reactions.

You just stick a Q-Tip into the dye solution, dab it on your skin, and go.\n\nOn the dark side, a couple of hours after dabbing my elbow with said Q-Tip, my skin turned red and puffy, just like it had for Natural Instincts. The hives and itching haven't hit me yet, but I expect they will.\n\nI can't return the box because I've opened it (well, maybe I \"could,\" but I wouldn't feel right about it), so I'll consider this a $11 PPD allergy test.

I previously had the 3605x model for three years; it did an okay job but seemed to tire after three years and it didn't shave the neck area all that well so I decided that I wanted a new shaver for Christmas a few years back.  I received this razor and was pleasantly surprised at first.  It gave me a close comfortable shave the first time I used it with no irritation.  Norelco states that three weeks are necessary for skin and beard to adjust, but this was not true for me.  I like that this razor has an LED display that makes it charge in an hour for 45 minutes of shave time unlike my other razor that took the entire day to charge.  As time went on I obtained an excellent shave on my face but it just didn't do an excellent job in the neck area.

I've tried it trimming very short amounts of hair, or longer. It doesn't seem to matter much.\n\nThe third strike is that 2-3 times during a trimming I have to remove the trimming guide, and then the blades to remove hair from underneath the blades. I don't see why hair should get trapped under there, but it does and reduces the trimming ability significantly. I don't think I should have to dismantle the trimmer to trim my beard. It's done this since day one.\n\nOtherwise, it works pretty well. With some patience and a bit of mess it does a pretty good job at trimming.

I thought that if I used it with the power adapter, it would cut even if it was not fully charged. Fact is that, even if you have the power adapter plugged in to the wall, if it is not fully charged you will NOT be able to cut. This sux if you are in the middle of a haircut and you run out of juice. (happened to me) and so I had to wait with hair patches till the thing was charged again to be able to finish the cut. Maybe I should have read the instructions, but I've had other rechargable battery clippers in the past and as long as you had it plugged it would work even if it was not fully charged.\n\nThis is a big flaw for me and that's why I take away 2 stars. Other than that the machine is great, Cipper sizes are very good, stable, convenient/all in one. Good product that could be better if the battery/power options were improved.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I first bought a Norelco rotating reflex head shaver in the late 1970's -- I was a grad student with very little money but scraped enough together to buy the razor (expensive back then) because a close friend recommended it.  This technology immediately proved to give a terrific, easy shave, and I have stayed with the Norelco shaver line ever since.  The so-called \"Lift and Cut\" configuration has two sets of angled, stacked blades in the rotating shaver head, and I have every reason to believe that Norelco's illustrations and claims of their special effectiveness are correct.\n  For many years I simply bought the least expensive Norelco reflex razor every few years and did not bother with replacement heads (a set of heads costs more than half of what the lowest-priced razor model costs).  Razor performance during this period of about 20 years was always great -- as the saying goes, they will have to pry these razors out of my cold, dead hands.\n  Then, with the advent of Amazon and eBay, my approach changed in recent years.  Instead of buying new razors, I began saving some money by buying sets of new replacement heads on Amazon.  Also, I really liked the low-end, powerful Norelco 6423LC model that Norelco had discontinued (it is not rechargeable but is great for travel because it is 120/240 volt).  So, more recently I bought a few used 6423LC's on eBay and set them aside so that I would always have at least one for many years to come.\n  After a few years of using replacement heads from Amazon, it gradually dawned on me that shaving had become a lot harder -- it took a lot more time, more passes, and harder pressure to complete a shave.  The degradation in shaving experience was kind of subtle at first but eventually I reached the conclusion that maybe something was really, really wrong with the replacement heads.  And it got to be very irritating indeed, figuratively and literally.\n  I also bought and tried \"Vollco Sharpening Heads\", which are designed to hone the edges of worn-down Norelco reflex razor heads, but these did not succeed at all in getting me back to a great, easy shave.\n  I reluctantly began to consider the possibility that the replacement heads from Amazon were counterfeit.  On the face of it this seems pretty improbable, because the head blades themselves are very intricate little devices with very close dimensional tolerances.  It seemed impossible that counterfeiters would develop the expensive equipment and processing skill to make a crummy imitation version of Norelco's heads and still hope to make money on them.  Also, the replacement heads from Amazon look excatly like those in a new razor, even under magnification.\n  Nonetheless, about 9 months ago I decided to do a test by purchasing replacement heads directly from the Norelco website.  I put a couple of sets into the shopping cart and tried to check out, but the process repeatedly failed and I gave up back then.  What are the odds, right?  I figured maybe I was just wasting my time.\n  However, a few weeks ago I traveled to see my sister and brother-in-law, and I threw one of my used razors from eBay into my carry-on.  Now, one thing I learned early on with these razors is that you have to empty out the shavings every time you use them in order to avoid buildup and jamming.  So, every morning I pull off the head assembly and tap it against the sink.\n  To my surprise on the first morning using the eBay razor, there was about twice as much whisker material down the wall of the sink bowl as I was accustomed to seeing after every shave.  It was pretty dramatic, especially given that the razor had been used for an unknown number of shaves before I bought it on eBay.\n  So, when I got home a few days later I went back to the Norelco website and persevered until, with their customer service help, I got two sets of replacement heads ordered and delivered.  Two days ago I loaded in a new set and turned on the razor.\n  Big surprise at the outset -- it actually sounded noticeably different from what I had generally been hearing from various Norelco razors and head sets over the years.  And the shave was, finally, terrific and easy again!  I did not expect this at all, because it seems so COMPLETELY improbable that someone would go to the trouble of counterfeiting these intricate little devices.\n  But with three new facts in hand (changed sound, more whisker material, and really great, fast shave again), the conclusion, however improbable, seems incontrovertible -- there is something wrong with the replacement heads.\n  All things considered, my best guess is that these replacement heads sold on Amazon actually do come from the same factory in China where the good ones from Norelco are made, but are somehow being diverted and stolen from the production line at a point before some sort of final, critical manufacturing step(s) is carried out.\n  For example, though I'm not a metallurgist, I do know that there are some highly specialized techniques and expensive equipment for hardening the surfaces of cutting edges, such as by using metal sputtering or ion implantation to harden just the first few layers of atoms on a metallic surface or edge.  These techniques can create highly specialized alloy surfaces or whatever.\n  If Norelco's factory has high security for heads emerging from a final processing step but misses diversion and theft of heads from an earlier point in the production process, that would explain all the facts without having to invoke the idea of a totally separate counterfeiting plant.\n  Obviously I will buy replacement heads ONLY from Norelco in the future.\n  I hope this review helps some people.  I will be happy to provide whatever information I can to help skeptics understand that this review is genuine.  For example, I have (i) emails from Norelco's website showing my failed purchase attempt much earlier this year and the successful purchase a week ago, plus (ii) records of all my eBay razor purchases, and (iii) my purchases of replacement heads from Amazon:  Feb 26, 2007; Feb 10, 2008; Dec 20, 2009; Dec 12, 2010; Aug 5, 2011; Aug 21, 2012; July 29, 2013; and the Vollco sharpeners on Aug 21, 2012.\n  I have nothing to gain from publicizing this information -- I'm just very pleased indeed with the outcome and grateful to Norelco for putting out a fine product for several decades now.\n\nP.S.  Now that I have read some other reviews of these replacement heads, it seems possible that there actually is ALSO a counterfeit production source, because some reviewers said that the screens and blades failed immediately.  This would not happen with heads diverted from an intermediate step the Norelco production process.  I would guess that we are now deaing with at least two sources of problems with the replacement heads.  Or maybe Norelco retains control of one source that makes the high-quality heads that are available on Norelco's website but also enabled some other, less capable source to make the heads that work so poorly.", "label": 0}

I never considered that trying a \"natural\" and \"organic\" product would put me at risk. I'm ready to go back to toxic products that at least leave my hair intact and looking nice. I never heard of anyone getting scalp cancer, has anyone? So, I now have black hair that's coming out as I touch it and I have a bald spot at the hairline.

{"text": "OK. Let's just say that I'm looking for the perfect cut, without going to the barber shop.  The Norelco T980 is good, but, it doesn't completely live up to the claims on the product details.  Yes, it does have a turbo button that acts like a facial hair trimmer NOS booster.  However, the blades don't seem to make a perfect cut.  Even after spending considerable time, I still have the wild hair or two left that requires special attention.  The vacuum, unlike how it is described, does NOT pick up all of the hair being cut.  In fact, you'll find your sink littered with remains after even the briefest of jobs.  All of this said, I've used a few other trimmers in the past and this is one of the best.  One more thing, the device feels light (and a bit cheap).", "label": 2}

{"text": "Edited 5/13/2016:\n\nI've used this product for years and it worked great with longer bristles.  It always had a tendency for the bristles to get brittle due to the heat of the curling iron,, and then the bristles break off very easily.  The last two I purchased, the bristles starting breaking off within a month of usage.  It used to take several months of use for this to happen.  The plastic you are using on the bristles is defective.  Please remedy this.\n\nThey recently shortened the bristles and it makes it easy to burn your hand because of this.  Please make the bristles longer.  Also, they bristles become weak due to heat and start to break.  Please make the bristles out of better material.\n\nTo Helen of Troy:  If you could make it get hotter, and make it heat up quickly, and make the bristles longer like they were before, and make the bristles last longer before getting brittle and breaking off , I would give it 5 stars.", "label": 0}

You have every time -really only one, because I will never do it again- to dismount the heads block and install a strange tools).\n\nAlso, it is heavy and bigger than the past models (About 5 years ago models).

When I had it on, I got less reaction from people than when I was not wearing it. Now, I understand that many people stare/look at me already, without the cologne on, but I wanted to see if the \"science\" in this actually worked. As a man who believes more in science, I had high hopes for this product.\n\nI did not like the scent enough to make it my favorite cologne--the smell was leaning more towards a cheap perfume than a costly cologne. It doesn't smell bad enough for me not to wear, I just don't prefer it over other colognes. I am going to go back to my old cologne, John Varvatos, but for now, I am going to switch day-to-day from my old cologne to this cologne.\n\nMy friend, who is a girl, told me that it turned her off (which is a good thing since I am aiming towards men). So, maybe the cologne does work but it just isn't not capable with me. Therefore, I cannot say that it didn't work because it obviously did something to my friend but I am not going to say that it did work since I received less reaction from people (reason for the three stars).\n\nI will be experimenting with this more, maybe mix it with Abercombie and Fitch's \"Wood\" cologne (since it doesn't have a great smell). But overall, it might be better just to wear your own \"unique\" cologne (or perfume, as I read that one of the reviewers is a girl) so that when you do find someone, they'll be able to connect you to your sent.\n\nIf you wanted to know, the scent did not change with time when I applied it to my skin, which is usually a good thing.

I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy.

If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event!

I tried this unit for a week having used a braun unit before that, and I really had to works at cutting everything which irritated my face a bit...(and my face doesn't irritate easily)  Besides having to work more, those three big heads impress me as having too much surface area to be rubbing on your face at once which just adds to irritation.  But,  if you work long enough, eventually you have a semi decent shave.  After I was done with the norelco, I pulled out my old braun, and found that I could still cut more, and was working a lot less to do it.  Also trimming a line is a bit difficult around beards etc since it's hard to tell exactly where the floating heads are..  Guess what... I'm not done...  The norelco has Ni-Cad batteries which in general does the job, but this is year 2000+ folks... Ni-Cads are dead...  Ni-Cads require they be drained to zero every use otherwise they start to loose their capacity..

{"text": "I did not understand why all the people went insane about this blush. It's only beautiful on fair skin. I am somewhat medium tan (Barcelona in Nars Sheer Glow), and this blush works mainly as a highlight than anything else, because of the shimmer. I honestly don't mind the golden shimmer, it's beautiful but it's the low pigmentation that seems to appear just chalky on my skin tone. All Nars blushes are known for their high pigmentation, but this 'Orgasm' and 'Sex Appeal' don't really have much of a payoff on medium tanned skin tones. I like to pay big buck for a product when I know it will be noticeable, and these shades are not.\nInstead 'Deep Throat' and 'Torrid' are fantastic alternatives. They're similar coral, peachy slight pinks, with beautiful gold shimmer running through them. I wear Torrid on a regular basis, it's a my 'go to blush'.\nThe longevity of all Nars blushes is fantastic. They last through out the day. I have a naturally oily skin, so I am usually concerned about products slipping off my face. But when I wear Nars blushes, I am confident that I don't have to worry about re-applying through out the day.

In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.

It seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean. No one wants details as to where and how this product was used, but I will say if you're hoping for a multitasking razor this isn't it. I would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when I had one, and it worked okay, but sometimes snag the larger hairs, needed multiple passes, etc. This isn't a big deal, I think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub-par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both.\n\nWhat really lost stars was the product's history of breaking through no fault of the user. Unfortunately, even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it WILL end up breaking. Now I know nothing last forever, but I think for an electronics device that costs $40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week, it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years.\n\nSadly Norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well, so I replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer.

So I put it on recharge and then removed the clipper thingy, rotated the motor rod - which basically is the one that causes the blades to vibrate back and forth- and then it worked. And then after sometime it got completely stuck and i could not even hear the motor sound, so I had to clean the head - pull out the vibrator thingy and clean the whole thing as some hair has gotten into it!!\nAnd then for the last 1 month or so it seems to be working fine.\nAs far the blades are concerned they are decently sharp and get the trimming work done.\n\nSo you basically get what you pay for. Before this one I had the remington trimmer which was probably the same price or maybe 10 bucks more, and it worked good for about 2 yrs until it totally shut of one day all of a sudden. So next time probably I will go back to remington as this one does not seem to be that sturdy.", "label": 2}

I like the shaved head thing (better than a crome dome) and tried shaving my head with a blade a few months ago and it was just too much work to shave my whole melon every morning, so I blew it off.\nBut once I tried this Norelco (on my face) and was ready to send it back because it SUCKS (yes, I fell for the marketing BS \"its as close as a blade\" - ARG!), I thought, \"Hey, maybe I should try THIS on my head.\"  And it is PERFECT.  No, it still doesn't shave as close as a blade, but it shaves close enough for my head... and it doesn't take too long... just a quick \"going over\" all over my head every morning in the shower and I'm done.  So now I shave my face with a Quatro and my head with this handy-dandy Norelco.\nSo for a face shaver... I give it 0 stars.  But for a head shaver... I give it 5.

Not that the old one was that heavy, but there is a difference.  Also, the back side of the razor is no longer flat.  Must be for ergonomic reasons.\n\nA huge difference is the sound/noise level.  The old one you could tell the difference from when it was fully charged versus when it was near the end of it's charge.  There was a definite slow-down.  The new one, you can barely tell that it's on.  Is this normal?  I mean, it sounds very anemic, like it's already running out of charge, and I gave it a full overnight 8 hour charge.\n\nAs far as shaving goes, it's good, but not a miracle worker.  You still have to make a few passes over an area to get all of it clean.\n\nOverall, I'm going to give it a few more weeks to see if I really like it.  I will withhold giving it 5 stars until then.

The first time I shaved, my neck was actually all bloody.  Even after trying every sensitivity setting, it still tends to cause red marks and irritation on the neck.  After switching back to the Braun my neck is healthy again.  Another problem that others have pointed out is that the 3 head design is hard to clean and makes it difficult to cut side burns.  Also the trimmer is terrible because of its placement and lack of cutting ability.  The Spectra is also twice the size of the Braun which is a bit of a nuisance on trips.  On the plus side, the Spectra has excellent battery life.  Furthermore, the Spectra is better than the Braun if you go several days without shaving.  The Spectra excels when it comes to tackling long hairs.  The Braun tends to get stuck and pull hairs, if you go to long without shaving.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have used beard trimmers for over a decade. Most of that time I have used Norelco trimmers. For me their current \"latest greatest\" is a mixed bag. The vacuum feature has helped bring matrimonial harmony to the bathroom. When used per the directions the vacuum does a nice job of scooping up errand beard trimmings (good but not perfect.) If reducing beard scraps from your sink is a priority it's an excellent choice. It's a chunk nosier than it's non-vacuum predecessor. If you are looking for peace and quiet, I'd sharpen your scissors, or buy a trimmer without a vacuum. My only concern about the product is the increase 1/4 inch pace between the leading edge and the cutting blades that is caused by the addition of a vacuum. If you are looking for exact cuts, choose another trimmer and put a towel over your sink. All in, not bad, not great. I look forward to the evolution of vacuum models in the years ahead.\n\nSharply yours,\n\nJeff", "label": 2}

Not wanting to rush into it from past failures I looked up a few reviews on YouTube,  one in particular made me decide to take the plunge.  I was very excited to receive it hoping that maybe just maybe this was the answer to my prayers. Upon using it I was experiencing a burning sensation that only got worse the longer I let it sit on my scalp,  I just thought \"oh that must mean it's working\"  but each time I washed my hair it was just this uncomfortable burning combined with a pungent chemical odor. To make a long story short it did absolutely NOTHING for my issue, in fact it made it that much more problematic,  so my search continues.  I can't say \"do not buy this!\"  it might work well for you, it has obviously been a good thing for other people hence the reviews.

{"text": "Follow up 7 WEEKS - OK, I like it better than at first. The trick listed later about running for two hours with the heads open to run the battery down, then full recharge seems to have worked. No further problems with battery, charge or life. Heads are still very, very nice. The washout feature is the best part of the whole deal. Excellent and comfortable shave, but very expensive and should have been better.\nFOLLOW-UP: 1 WEEK\nMy mistake - I guess the battery IS L-ion instead of Ni-Cd. Don't know where I thought I got the bad info. Oh well. Still, the point is even MORE important in that case; this system seems to be buggy. Surely somebody at Philips knows enough about battery tech to have helped the shaver division do better than this! If not, should have got a bit of help from Nokia. Out of all the cameras, camcorders, cell phones, Palms, computers etc. that I use that have L-ion batteries, this is the \"shakiest.\" I'll post again to follow up on the \"conditioning\" cycle I tried. So far it seems to be working better.\nFIRST REVIEW\nI have used various Norelco rechargable triple header shavers for the last 30+ years. I have been impressed that each model I purchased has been an improvement over the previous one. Well, maybe that isn't the case this time. My last shaver was a 5885 XL that I have used more than three years. It was getting pretty \"tired\" and I was looking forward to an upgrade. Hmmm.\nTHE GOOD NEWS\nSHAVING EXPERIENCE - this is the best shaving machine of any type I have every used. I can shave as close as diligent effort with a good blade razor. I think the little holes in the head along with the familiar slots make a big difference. You have to go slowly to get really close, but it is comfortable and does a great job. Top notch performance from the head system.\nCLEANING- the ability to clean the razor under the faucet is a big plus. I open the head and rinse under hot tap water after every use, then leave the head open and let it air dry. I disassembled the heads once for more thorough cleaning. I expect once a month would be plenty often for this since you can do a quick, easy clean every day. This really is a nice feature, and I suspect it keeps the cutters working better, too.\nNOT MADE IN CHINA!\nTHE BAD NEWS:\nBATTERY!\nI charged overnignt before first use. First few charges, I only got about 20 minutes shaving before the machine shut down. When applying a little extra cutting pressure, the shaver would unexpectedly stop, and the \"minutes left\" readout would go to zero. This happened several times. Plugging in may or may not get you any more shaving. Last time it did this, I recharged fully, then with the head open, let the motor run for about 2 hours until the battery was fairly well (I assume) discharged. Then, I fully recharged it. I hope this \"conditions\" the NiCd battery. So far it seems to be working better. Still, this is pretty sad for a shaver in this price range. For the money  Norelco gets for this thing, it should have intelligent L-ion battery technology in it!\nHANDLE ERGONOMICS\nNot bad, but a step backwards from the 5885.\nFANCY DISPLAY?\nWho sold who a bill of goods on this deal? There is no more information than on pevious models; it is in a less usable format (minutes remaining instead of shaves remaining) and you have TO TURN THE SHAVER ON to see the current charge status. The stupid display is blank until you run the shaver. On previous LCD models, you could ALWAYS read the display. If Norelco REALLLY REALLY thinks they need to use this LED display, at least put a button on the shaver to turn on the display without having to run the shaver! This is dimbulb design of the first order.\nCHARGING\nPast models didn't need a \"wall wart\" charger. They directly plugged into a range of voltages etc. without any kind of wall transformer/power converter dealie. This was nice since all older Norelco cords worked and they were not special. The new \"James Bond\" shaver is a big step backwards since it now has a \"wall wart.\" I expect there is actually a good reason for this; the wash out under the faucet feature probably requires low voltage to the shaver head rather than line voltage. If that is the case, it is worth the trade off, I guess. Still, the older system was more convenient.\nSUMMARY/RECOMMENDATION:\nShaving heads are great. The rest of the machine is not Norelco's best effort. Buy the cheapest shaver that incorporates the Norelco SPECTRA heads and save your money on the \"100\" minute batteries and the lame readout.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Heres the deal , like you.. was looking for a shaver for typical touch up here and there.\n\nOut of the box, easy to use, works , nothing crazy... BUT, there is some tricks to the trade\n\nFor example, if you have longer hair in areas such as under your arm or down by the pipes, make sure you cut it down first with the outer blades. I believe the original design was that you held the unit up against your skin perpendicular. This allows the outer edge to go to battle first, and then allow the tiny blades (centered) to clean it up.  This would be perfect if it was 100%\n\nIts not. you will have to go through multiple passes.  And so you know, I am not grizzly. In fact, I wouldn't even consider myself average as I have little to no hair on most of my body. Just your typical areas. Previously I used a BRAUN body shaver, which I LOVED.  I believe the main reason was because  the blades were sharp and it was small. I figured I try something new, and so for.. eh.. its alright\n\none thing to note about this philips just looking at the head. When you are getting to areas that are , eh lets say slimmer .. this trimmer is tough to do some personal preference touch up. what I mean is, its all or nothing. Its not easy to shave small areas or detailed work.  Other than that, the wet use is plus but have you ever shaved with full running water?

{"text": "Update 3/7/15-- The formula for Badedas has been changed by Unilever, and I no longer recommend this product. Several significant ingredients have been omitted, the pine scent is gone, the consistency is thinner, and the experience like an ordinary bubble bath. Save your money, this is not the original German formula Badedas many people used and loved for decades...\n\nOriginal review from 2009: \"It's Good To Be Bad\"  I was introduced to Badedas bubble bath about 30 years ago by my sister, who said the stuff had near-magical properties (it does). She said it's full of unusual botanicals (true), makes tons of long-lasting bubbles (yup), smells incredibly good (oh yeah), and leaves the tub sparkling clean (also true).  The cost back then was around $1 an ounce.\n\n  I've become mostly a shower-taker, but recently, when my 20-year-old bottle of Bededas turned up empty, I decided to revisit the stuff.  Remembering my sister's warning that the \"Vita-Bath\" products are an American copy of Bededas without all the great botanicals, I was looking for the genuine article.  Lo and behold, I found it on Amazon, of course, from several dealers at various price-points.  Smallflower (aka Merz Apothecary of Chicago) seems like a reputable dealer, selling the real deal, and even with somewhat exorbitant shipping, the price is now LESS than $1 an ounce.  Pretty good for 30 years.  Shipping was quite fast, by the way, and the product arrived UPS on the sixth calendar day after ordering.\n\n  This Badedas (now owned by Sara Lee!) is apparently the original formula, made in Germany, with the horse chestnut oil that helps make it so magical. It also contains limonene, a very citrus-scented hydrocarbon derived from plants, and linalool, a more floral-spicy scented chemical found in over 200 species of plant.  Not the kind of stuff you'd find in your average drugstore bubble bath.  The overall scent is somewhat pine-y, and incredibly fresh and pleasant.\n\n  A small amount of Badedas added to running hot water makes a lot of luxurious bubbles.  The overall sensation is one of slight skin-softening without the oiliness you get with some products.  Also, a slight sense of skin-tightening, but this is somewhat subjective. USE NO SOAP in a Badedas bath-- you don't need any.  Just a washcloth or sponge, and you leave the bath feeling quite clean.  Badedas seems to absorb dirt and body oils and odors into solution, and it all goes down the drain, leaving you, and your bathtub, quite clean.  Remarkable stuff.\n\n  If you ever take a bath for relaxation, or even a wash-up, I'd highly recommend Badedas.  Smallflower has an excellent price on this 25.5 ounce size, and if you take one bath a week, this bottle should last you at least two years!  Badedas is a wonderful luxury bath product, and would make a terrific gift for a bubble bath fan, or even yourself and/or your mate.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Avalon Organics has pulled the proverbial fast one in re-formulating their CoQ10 wrinkle Defense serum. READ THE INGREDIENTS, this formula, and the original are not the same. It has been cheapened, and in sneaky, underhanded sort of way.\n\nFirst, why is the description on the new product so nebulous and evasive? Obviously its because they're hoping no one will notice and check the difference in ingredients. They simply say, \"new, more sustainable\", not \"improved\" or \"new formula\". The ingredients have completely changed, and for the worse. While the original product was excellent, with high amounts of anti-oxidants, like arnica and white tea extract, as well as generous amounts of CoQ10, this product only has a whole lot of cheap oils, aloe vera, and glycerin. And the CoQ10 is wayyyyyyyy down at the bottom, one of the LAST ingredients. The original formula's CoQ10 content was MUCH higher, with it 6th or 7th from the top.\n\nWhen I called Avalon to voice my complaints, the customer service rep had a bad attitude, and basically said, \"whatever\", but said she would issue a refund with the receipt.\nThey don't really seem to care, and obviously don't want my business. What a bummer, because the original formula was just great.\n\nIn short...don't buy it!", "label": 0}

Another issue was that it was relatively easy to move the height adjustment by accident when taking off and replacing the plastic trimmer guard, which you need to do in order to switch cutting heads. It wasn't a really big deal, but a lot of times I wouldn't remember which number I had the hair length set on, and then I would have to guess what setting I had it one the last time I used it.....The vacuum feature was nice I guess in that it doesn't get too many little beard trimmings all over the sink, but then again it's really easy to just turn on the sink and rinse it, or, use the trimmer over a rug where you'll never see the small trimmings.....\n\nBut the big lesson here is to be sure buy a wet/dry beard trimmer that won't die if it gets a little wet.

{"text": "I love NARS eyeshadows, lip glosses, and foundations, but I've not had the same luck with their blushes. I love this shade of pink, which is flattering even to my pinkish skin tone, but it's caked very hard in the palette and is difficult to get on the brush. I had to really dig my kabuki brush into the color, which--over time--created a \"well\" in the center of the palette where the mirror is showing. If NARS would make their blushes just a little easier to apply, I'm sure this would be a knockout.\n\nAlthough I don't really care for the powder blush, I'm in love with NARS Orgasm Illuminator, a highlighting cream that gives my face a shimmery, refreshed look.

{"text": "I wear some kind of lash extensions at all times. I either do them myself or have them done professionally. I like them very exaggerated (\"gaudy\" I guess some people would say!) Ardell's lashes are a nice product, but there are two drawbacks to these particular lashes. First, the \"long\" length are so long they are difficult to group together and to get all pointed in the proper direction. You get a half-crazed looking \"Twiggy\" (supermodel) effect, with clumps of super-long lashes pointing in various directions. I have used & do recommend the \"medium\" length instead. They are still long & dramatic, but \"sit\" next to each other better, and don't lack control on the ends so that they end up pointing off in random directions.\nMy second criticism is that this brand of lashes are a bit too thin. The lashes I have applied at the salon (I don't know what kind they are) take tinting (mascara) and thicken up nicely. These lashes do not respond favorably to mascara, and so there is no practical way to make them look thicker and darker. Applying more lashes just gives you more lashes - they are still very much on the wispy side.\nThese lashes do work, but I recommend the medium length. This pack is also a good buy.", "label": 2}

I've been using mostly Edge shave gel for at least the past year and since you can run the whole thing in water (I haven't used it in the shower in a couple years), it's easy to clean. Unfortunately, it will still get pretty nasty over time. And I think the inserts generally helped get a closer shave in less time. So there's trade-offs...\n\nIn case you're wondering, the main body unit has performed admirably for years, the battery still holding a charge good for a few days of decent shaves. I don't let it run down too much as that drastically affects the closeness of the shave, which has never been the best, but pretty good for an affordable wet/dry.

And so, if you're like me, you may be looking to save a few bucks, so you're considering an electric shaver.

Almost the same as shaving only in a downward motion with your hand razor.\n\n2)  Your sideburns will still need to be straightened by a hand razor, don't think you'll be maneuvering this thing in a straight line, to make a straight line.\n\n3)  People who have sensitive necks need to be careful not to spend too much time on their necks, or you'll go raw.\n\nI've used this shaver for about a year.  I've used it with the lotion stuff, without, with shaving cream, or with simply just water and all work great.  Let me stress that this works fine for a daily shaver; for normal daily events.

So I asked for an exchange, which came quickly. The exchange set was exactly like the first and made the same racket. I sent it back for a refund.

I even went to the store to get a jar to compare it to, (yes, the new packaging) and it doesn't smell the same. I'm afraid to put it on my face!", "label": 0}

{"text": "I purchased this unit to replace a 7-year old Norelco trimmer (that had an integral main blade and an integral mini pop-up blade, but no vacuum).\n\nGood Points:  Comfortable, not too noisy, even on \"Turbo\" setting.  Strong blades clip everything in sight.  Mini trimmer blade is sharp and precise.  Guide pops off easily.  Comfortable to hold.  Vacuum does pick up lots of beard/stache clippings and it's easy to empty clippings,too.  Easy to change lengths. Nice travel bag.  Battery life excellent (but do NOT overcharge and obey the drain-to-zero recommendations).\n\nBad Points:  Vacuum not strong enough to suck up all clippings...you'll still need to trim over a sink or trash container, which really takes away from the advantage of having the vacuum (even on the Turbo setting).  Length indicator needs a stronger click-and-hold ratchet mechanism -- too easy to accidentally change length settings.  I miss the pop-up mini trimmer:  Having to manually swap out blades is a pain.  The trimmer can't stand up, even temporarily...it can only be stored in the bag or lying down.\n\nSummary:\nThis trimmer might be the best compromise of cost / features / functionality out there, but was disappointed with the vacuum capabilities even on Turbo.  I was very impressed by the cutting quality.", "label": 2}

Not 2 or 3, but as many as 5 or 6 to get the job done. But it eventually gets the job done. The flip-out trimmer works fine. The ability to rinse it out in water is a plus, quick and convenient.

Brauns flat-head electric ravors have always been pretty much fine for me, but I was willing to try this one to try and reduce the hassle/occassional discomfort.  Admittedly, it seems solidly constructed, has a powerful motor and \"feels\" like a quality product.  It shaves fairly close, and perhaps misses fewer stray hairs then the flat-head electric razors.  It also does fairly well on the typical weekend growth.  However, on an overal closeness basis it doesn't seem superior to the better Brauns I have used.  (Braun does make some low-end shavers to avoid).  The 6885 does have some downsides - it seems to take longer to use then the better Brauns, and is certainly rougher on the face.  They say it takes 20 days to get used to it; I've had it for around 40, and its still rougher on the face then my old Braun. Nothing serious, but I have redness for a few minutes after each shave.

It worked pretty good except when cutting your hair, rather than trimming a beard/moustache, you have alot more hair to vac.

I did manage to bend the little spring which is very small and quite delicate and now the trimmer vac system works much less efficiently.  If you clean it, beware of the weeny spring.  Use tweezers when removing the spring and putting it back and too if you do take the spring out, place it someplace where it can't fall or get knocked off.  The other item that proved to be a challenge on this trimmer is the adjustable head lock.  While cutting my hair the last 2 times the lock slips from a higher setting down to a lower setting and in my case I had a much shorter buzz than I intended.

{"text": "Im going to keep this short. This pomade does not work for me, the experience was terrible. I was working on my hair for 30 min this morning because this Pomade was too heavy and it flattened my hair. After seeing that I was going to be late I grudgingly left for work. I used about a quarter size glob of it, I put my index finger in and stuck it in about half a nail deep and scooped it up. The consistence is like uh...hot glue I guess. I had to really rub it in my hands to get it to melt enough to apply. I applied it on a towel dried hair. It made most of my hair flat, and some little spikes that formed around my cowlick did not stay down. I do have to say it held very very well. But its over kill in my opinion. Heres a example, today I went to cardio kickboxing class and sweated like a mule. I came out of there with my hair still the same looking. All that sweat did nothing to phase my hairdo. Now all of this stuff is forgivable, what really did it in for me is how hard this stuff is to wash out. I know you all hear of how bad Murray's is to wash but let me tell you exactly how bad it is. The internet downplays it in a joking manner, I am not amused. I washed my hair 5 times in the shower with 2 Shampoo's scrubbing and massaging vigorously; to no avail. So I took my soap bar and tried that, did not work. I then tried conditioner thinking maybe it would soften my hair but that didn't work either. After towel drying my hair, I can still sculpt it, like if I just applied hair spray. I am not sure why anyone would want a product that is so bloody hard to remove I don't look forward to putting my greasy waxy hair on my pillow. What is worse the Murrays that DID wash out ended up on my face, so even after washing my face 2 times with a scrub I still have a waxy layer on my cheek and forehead area.\n\nSo in conclusion, yeah this stuff is not for me. I think I might try Vitali's or Groom&Clean next as they are water based and easier to wash out. I give it 3 stars because the product works. What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue. Its just not for me, if I rated on personal experience I would give it a 1 star. I plan on giving the remaining Murray's to a co worker as a gag joke. If I am going to have this crud in my hair for a week I might as well have someone to share my agony with.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This product may be very effective when used correctly, but I cannot recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly. I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these. After the first day, I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger; however, the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.\n\nSome tips I learned the hard way:\n\n-Don't believe that you can just throw them on and do something else. I spent the entire time they were on in front of the mirror adjusting and dealing with saliva. Paper towel is almost a necessity. I can't help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.\n\n-Don't rip the pouches open, use scissors. Ripping them will pull on the backing, and wrinkle up the strips before you can use them.\n\n-Immediately after placing the strip, wipe your fingers off before adjusting the strips. Adjusting could take a while, and your fingertips will turn white from the gel.\n\nI really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use. Some rigidity to the strips would do wonders. The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut, something more like bandages would be nice. Also, why not make the lower strips as wide as the top? The material is there, they just cut a smaller strip out...\n\nI may end up with whiter teeth, but next time I'm using the old-fashioned tray and gel.", "label": 0}

{"text": "UPDATE 4/26/14: My original review is below, but I am updating based on the new formula. I no longer like this product, it does not moisturize the way it used to and leaves my skin feeling dry/chapped. I believe they have now changed the formula twice (in just over a year). I don't know why they keep changing it, but I won't be buying it anymore.\n\nOriginal review from 3/14/13: I did not have high expectations when I purchased this. I just wanted a cream that moisturizes and wasn't too expensive. I'm in my late 20s and started noticing my skin was beginning to get a little droopy, losing elasticity, about a year ago. In addition, I have a few fine lines that I was not happy with! I'd been using anti-wrinkle creams with and without retinyl for a while, but nothing made any improvement. I tried Loreal Revitalift, Neutragena Healthy skin, Eucerin Q10, Nivea Visage, etc, with no change. I've been using this cream for about 2 months now and I definitely notice a subtle change in my skin. My cheeks are not nearly as saggy as they were and the bags under my eyes have slightly diminished as well. My fine lines have not changed.\n\nI use it twice a day, after I shower and before I go to bed. I don't use it in the morning as I prefer to use a lotion with SPF during the day. Like I said, this cream won't worked miracles (I doubt any lotion will). But for the price, and compared to all the other much more expensive products I have used, this one is the best. My skin looks youthful, even toned, and my breakouts are not affected by the cream (which was an issue with Nivea). I don't give 5 stars often, but I could not find anything negative about this cream. If I had to choose something, I would say that the smell is a little off putting, almost floral, but not terrible.", "label": 0}

I stroked it again and again and yet it still missed the hairs.  Dissapointed, I attempted to shave my armpits.  It didn't work there either.  It left me with hair and a painful cut, which never happened with my Intuition.  After this experience, I am returning the razor with its 60-day money back guarantee.  In conclusion, I would recomenned not buying this but if you are just SO currious, buy it like I did and try it out.  Good luck with that.", "label": 0}

I don't know if I'd use this for my hair as it seems a little under powered for that and I agree with some of the other reviewers that the attachments are a bit fragile which is why this gets a four and not a five. However, for the $20 I paid for it, it seems perfect for my needs.\n\nAddendum to my initial review: I've just downgraded my original 4 star to a 3 star review. I'd actually give it maybe a two and a half if I could. Once this was initially charged I didn't have to charge it again for about 3 weeks. This was with just using it every other day or so for basic trimming. Now it will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes and it will not run if plugged into the charger.

The smaller bracket is 1/2 inches across. The outer 3/8 in or so of the brackets are bent upwards to prevent your brush or razor from sliding off accidentally.

The instructions are terrible and the print is tiny.\n\n3.  The parts of the trimmer did not fit properly together.\n\n4.

I'm a blade guy, when I can help it, but sometimes that isn't an option. Like those times when you're truly pinched for time in the morning or your schedule is so hectic you just can't fit a good blade shave in. There are definitely times during Wing Training Assemblies, given the duties I'm usually assigned, that that's the case.\n\nIs this a substitute for a blade? No, not really. It's a substitute for not having shaved at all. That's considered unacceptable in uniform. This won't give you a really clean shave, but with it at least you did shave, whereas if all you had was a blade you'd sometimes have to skip it and hope no one important notices!\n\nI've never replaced the cutter heads. Part of it is that I just never used this enough to worry about the prescribed interval. Thus, four years later, they're not worn out yet. However, Norelco HQ55+ replacements have disappeared from local retailers shelves where I live, so I'd have to order a set from a national retailer if I wanted to do so. In any case, the new heads cost as much or more than I paid for this thing in the first place, which was just shy of $30.\n\nThe trimmer works well enough. The cord stays put. The batteries haven't died yet - no batteries, no problem! This is a concern if you're getting it as a backup instead of regular use. It could sit most of the time for three or four years, you use it a handful of times, then the Ni-Cad or whatever rechargeable batteries your shaver uses die and you get to trashcan it just as if you'd used it daily.

I have very fine hair, and it does usually curl quite easily, but not with this product.  I had to run it through my hair a number of times and finally had to hold it for 20+ seconds to get any kind of 'bend' to my hair.  If I had an hour or so to curl my hair every morning I might rate this product as 'okay', because it does give volume to my hair, but I don't think I should have to repeatedly curl the same section of hair to get any kind of result.\n\nI also noticed (as have some other buyers mentioned) that this curling brush does have a tendency to grab hairs and slice them off before you have the opportunity to save them.

I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger.

{"text": "I have to start this review out by saying that there's a possibility that I was expecting a little too much from this product. Possibly because I had never used an electric razor before, I expected this to perform closely to a conventional, non-electric razor. Unfortunately, this actually takes more time and doesn't get as close as a traditional razor.\n\nIf you're buying this product to make shaving your body easier, look elsewhere. This will not cut down the time it takes to shave.\n\nAlso, I was excited at the possibility of using this for it's trimming capabilities as well. Unfortunately, the trimming that this product has to offer doesn't work very well either. I was had to \"comb\" over my armpits and pubic hair MANY many times before it actually trimmed it to the desired length. Then, I found that it had actually over-trimmed a piece of my left armpit as well, causing part of it to be bald! Lol, but I have to admit it's kinda funny. I would prefer to have a bald spot on my armpit than a Giant BUSH.\n\nIf you're buying this product for its trimming capabilities, look elsewhere. This doesn't do a terrific job at trimming armpit or pubic hair.\n\nDespite the fact that it performed pretty poorly however, I do have to say that I don't regret this purchase (although I think most people who expected it to help them shave faster and trim easier would be disappointed). I have highly sensitive skin, and traditional razors cut too close to the skin, which makes it irritated. This means I have to wait at least a week or two before I can shave again with a traditional razor. So...\n\nIf you're buying this product because you think it might be gentler than a traditional razor, I would give it a shot. It worked for me.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Like many of us folks out there who need to shave it lease once a day, I became extremely tired of dealing with these financially outrageous and environmentally damaging disposable razors, no matter how many dozens of blades they now staked on them.  If anything, the more blades they put on the surface, the more chance of soap and hair getting into the gaps, therefore making of the blades dull  almost immediately.  And perhaps thats the purpose in the first place so that we throw them away quicker!  Therefore like so many others now, I had a great desire to go retro, and like my father, use a classic single blade and razor, as well as stop using equally environmentally disastrous and hard on your skin aerosol shaving soaps, and instead, again like my father, use a brush and soap cup.  While I was purchasing these items I also noticed this neat looking stand which actually makes sense in that you can put your brush on it to keep it dry as well as your razor so you don't have to search for it every morning on your bathroom sink.  There are many choices for this kind of stand.  And it may seem silly to spend so much time researching the best one, but this is something of it literally could last a lifetime.  I remember that since I was a child until I moved from a home my father had the same razor brush and stand as well.  Therefore after careful research on glad I chose this Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  I ordered it, it arrived quickly, and is beautiful sturdy and extremely functional.

This has two problems:\n1) if the battery dies mid shave you are stuck looking like an idiot until it charges. This becomes a bigger problem as the battery life declines. It is also a concern if you try to use the device to shave your head.\n2) After about 2 years the battery dies and you have a paper weight. An overnight charge currently gives me about 60 seconds of reduced power shaving time. Not good for much. The battery is not designed to be consumer replaceable.\n\nThe actual shave was pretty good, for what that is worth. Though the attachments that control length have a lot of \"wiggle room.\" For a consistent length you either need to avoid putting any pressure at all, or make sure you are constantly putting full pressure on. Also, the release button that lets the guard drop all the way to the lowest setting is right in the center of the head. Right where you would want to put your thumb for strong control.

I think I've only ran out of charge with it in the shower once.  Once you get the initial trimming done, maintenance doesn't take very long, and so I've never had problems with battery life.  It automatically stops charging when the battery is full, which is nice, though I suppose if you don't use it for a while, the battery could drain even though it's in the charger, plugged in.  The guards are nice, and I like that the head has a trimmer pointing both directions, and the guards fit facing either way.\n\nAs I'm fairly hairy, I'm disappointed by how often I have to rinse it out while shaving.  I generally have to take the guard off each time I rinse, and the guard goes on easily, but is kind of tough to get off, so it's a pain having to do that every minute or two.  A lot of times, when I pull the guard off, I feel like it's going to break because it's so hard to pull off.  I end up pulling the foil out, accidentally, too fairly often.  It doesn't hurt anything, but it's a hassle.  I don't expect not to have to rinse/clean it while using it, but having to take the guards off so frequently is really annoying.  This being my first \"manscaping\" product, I can't say how it compares to other brands/models, but I'm a little disappointed.  It's not bad for the price, though.", "label": 2}

Overall the kit comes with everything a novice/professional would need to get started. I like that there are sample sizes of products I wouldn't have purchased, but enjoyed trying out in the set. When I bought this waxing kit I bought different gigi wax in addition to this set because I'm not a fan of their soft wax. Its decent for a beginners kit but not something I prefer using on my clients. Here's what I liked about the kit:: It has everything you need in the box to get started right away. There are several cardboard collars to keep the wax from dripping on your warmer. It heats up the wax very quickly and the price for the kit is reasonable. What I didn't like about the kit:: The warmer has a very poor gauge when it comes to heating up the wax. It either doesn't heat up or its burning hot so I have to turn the wax heater off before I use it on my clients otherwise I risk burning them. Probably not the best kit for a novice since they may end up burning themselves, but if you want a good deal and are experienced with wax machines this is not a bad deal.

While its true that the shaving blades are completely protected from nicking your skin, the vibrating trimmers pointing straight out on either side of the foil can make this shaver even more dangerous than a normal one.  I think a good solution would have to involve getting those trimmers out of harm's way, or maybe only putting a trimmer on one side of the foil, not both.\n\nAside from being primed for grabbing and cutting through some very sensitive skin, the trimmers on both sides also mean no matter where you want to shave with the foil, you're leading with a trimmer.  This limits what you can and can't do.  If you'd like to, for instance, shave bare all the way to the edge of your naughty bits, the trimmer's position means you'll be forced to trim the hair on part of your thigh as well.\n\nGood idea for a product, but clearly not as well-tested as it could have been.  3 stars for the quality construction and its ability for most areas, -2 for the dangerous design in the most important spots.", "label": 2}

I go through ridiculous lengths to ensure the longevity of my red hair ... before dying I use special PH balance shampoo & refrain from conditioning to ensure the dye gets soaked up by the pores as much as possible. I rinse it out with white vinegar, and then with COLD water. To maintain I use special color safe shampoos/conditioners AND mix a little dye in them to keep the color longer, & I always rinse with cold water and blow dry to seal the color in when I'm done, then use the cool setting when I'm done to close the follicle. I also only wash my hair every few days and on the off days I use dry shampoo. All of these things combined usually makes the dye last longer than normal.

Now, I understand waxing is supposed to be messy, but I knocked off two points mainly because this 'all purpose kit' did not come with the second most important ingredient...the wax removal oil.  What were they thinking not including a means of actually removing the wax?  That is a pretty big deal when you're finished and you have these huge pink globs all over your body and fingers, and no amount of soap will take it off.  Another reviewer on here saved me by mentioning cooking oil will take it off...vegetable oil most definitely did and now I know what a chicken feels like right before you throw it in the frying pan.  Thanks a lot, Gigi.\n\nIf you buy this kit, buy whatever wax remover the company sells as well, or trust me, you will be sorry.  Other than that, the kit is attractive, the instructions detailed and there are a nice assortment of lotions/creams/etc.  The 'Sure Clean' countertop remover is supposed to take wax off of floors, tables, wherever you accidentally blotched it.  Using this, it did not work well at all (I had to get a tooth brush out and scrub for about 5 minutes to get a few blotches off my sink)...I'm sure paint thinner would have worked better.\n\nOverall, not a bad product for the price.", "label": 2}

The ingredients are first-rate but it just needs a different label so you know what you get. The best surprise was the little sample of frankincense-myrrh soap -- that one I would definitely buy. The sandalwood sample was ok but that and the main feature here are going to be regifted. The scent of the \"Bay Rum & Spice\" is very close to an old duck decoy soap we got from Avon once -- just a little too strong for my tastes. So you might want to get this one as a gift but not if he (or she) is expecting bay rum. Also the makers should make a separate soap which is authentic bay rum and then the other spices can go into \"Wood Spice.\" Now you have a fuller holiday selection!", "label": 2}

(Still made in Holland as another reviewer wrote). It looked great, and I was excited about the water clean up feature. After an overnight charge, I gave it a test run. It was remarkably light and very quiet, it almost seemed to be running too slow to actually work, but it did a good job of removing my stubble. Just one problem -  It seemed to really abrade my face, which was quite irritated afterwards.  I do have sensitive skin, which is why I don't use a standard razor, but I never had this problem with the Braun, or the Remington razors I owned previously.\n\nIt states in the users manual that it may take a few weeks to get used to Norelco's patented lift & cut system, but I don't think I would ever get used to the irritation this razor caused. Call me a pansy, but I had to return the razor, and am now in search of a new Braun model with better ergonomics, and a smooth, painless shave.

I have to apply multiple times to see ANY evidence that any blush has been applied.  I use good brushes and do tap the product out before applying, but that is only to ensure even coverage, and is NOT a problem with my other blushes.  The other maaaajor problem with this blush is that it doesn't last.  I don't touch my face a lot, but somehow at the end of the day my cheeks always seem to be bare when I wear this.\n\nI won't be buying this again, and I recommend any Lorac blush over this----amazing pay-off and lasting consistency, plus beautiful colors.", "label": 2}

Please note this is a *trimmer*, not a shaver. Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn't recommend using this for a full shave. My previous trimmer was rechargeable, but I actually prefer batteries. The charge would frequently last no longer than a few minutes, even when I actually remembered to charge it. My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded.

It boasts a charge level indicator, incorporated vacuum, and fast 15-minute charging time.

Indeed, I wish all those miles were for the right reason. Let me explain:\n\nI view the newly added vacuum function adding only marginal benefit to this unit, at the expense of draining battery power fast, noise making, and increased diameter size.

Also, T7500 was smaller, it fit well in your hand and/or travel pouch, and could be charged at 110V-240V. Now, T970 requires a recharge every 3rd use or so, and it's so much harder to fit in you hand and/or in your travel bag since it has a larger diameter and comes with a power adaptor that works only at 110V. Cleaning T970 is akin to undoing a Matrioshka, the Russian nesting doll.\n\nThinking more about it, I came to the conclusion that T970 wasn't put together by industrial designers but some marketing types... For these guys I would venture to suggest that they should keep T7500 on the market; it would serve very well the traveller types, whereas its successor would be for stay-at-home folks.\n\nConsidering it sells at a discount and it comes with a 60-day return period, I am able to rate it cautiously at 3 stars.", "label": 2}

My first reaction about the T970:\n\nBAD:\n\n* Plastic is VERY flimsy - it doesn't have that tough look.\n\n* Lots of movable parts, which have very flimsy plastic hinges (I think I'll break them soon)\n\n* Not as compact as the original T6000 (Nape trimmer doesn't extend from inside but is rather a separate attachment)\n\n* AcuVac is junk - it doesn't catch all the hairs but most of them. (The trimmer is very loud because of the AcuVac.)\n\n* The little brush needs to be longer - it doesn't reach some of the parts where hairs stick, like the AcuVac containers bottom leaving me having to blow the hairs out - which land literally all over the place making me wonder why I bothered with the AcuVac in the first place.\n\n* Travel case needs to be more compact a made of tougher nilon, the charger alone is HUGE! T6000 had compartments for the Brush and the wire, snugly fitting together.  I'm afraid the pivoting head on the T790 will break off the first time I put the trimmer into my travel bag.\n\nGOOD\n\n* The pivoting head actually helps in raising hairs to get a more even shave, leaving hair softer (a feature I've lived without for 5 years, and think can go without a little further)\n\n* Charge Indicator is pretty cool.\n\nI bought it because it is the most expensive trimmer on the market, thinking PRICE=QUALITY, boy was I wrong, but with Amazon's special @ $43+change my girlfriend will have something to use to trim her poodle.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have been using Avalon Organics CoQ10 for years.  Both the day and night wrinkle defense creams.  To my complete dismay I cannot believe that the product and the packaging has changed so dramatically.  The original product was the best, and now it contains a reformulation that seems to benefit the bottom line of the company and not the customer.  First off, the formula does not contain all the original ingredients that made the product so great in the first place.  They have pulled many of the good things and have replaced them with less expensive ingredients.  The soft and wonderful formula left my skin glowing and now it is more paste-like on my face.  It goes on much more dry, which is not what 30+ skin wants.\n\nDo not let the \"more sustainable\" fool you.  It is not the same product as before.  The supposed sustained packaging is terrible.  I have had 2 bottles with defective pumps already.  The new formula is much thicker and the supposed great packaging and new pump allows only for a tiny amount to come out.  The last bottle simply had a pump that stopped working after the first few pumps.  I had to use the product by opening the bottle and labor to get some of the product onto the palm of my hand.  I have written to the company about the reformulation and never received one response in return.  They do not seem to care.\n\nIn addition, many people do not want the SPF they now add into the product.  It would have been better not to add it at all and let people opt to add this on top, or put out 2 separate formulations.  I am not sure why they took something great and turned it into a mediocre product at best.  In my opinion, look elsewhere, as this is not the great product it once was.", "label": 0}

For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative.  A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don't stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.  On size strip (larger than Crest's) fits both upper and lower teeth.  The active ingredients are the same as Crest, but the cost is about half the cost of Crest.

I found them to be absolutely unbearable next to the Feathers and the Astras.  In fact, these seemed to provide an exacerbated version of the downsides of each of the other blades.  They were far less sharp than the Astras but somehow far prone to nicking and irritating than the feathers.  To put this in perspective, I can definitely shave with Feathers and avoid nicks/irritation.  I cannot do so with these.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?

I get one or two shaves at full power and then another shave at half power..nothing like listening to your razor die while you are trying to shave.  It never held a good charge from day 1.\n\nAfter maybe a year the head assembly started falling apart when I took the top off to clean it out..nothing funner than fishing through the bathroom garbage for shaver parts, thanks Norelco!\n\nThe Good:\nFor those couple of shaves I may or may not get at full power I am happy, it cuts close and relatively quick.\n\nThe Sideburn/beard trimmer is nice.\n\nOverall this product has let me down big time..I guess I was spoiled by my old Philishave that was built like a tank, held a charge and could be used with the cord.

Frankly,I doubt that there are actually 8+ repairs in the container. I could not make the same repair that I did another seven times.

{"text": "I was looking for a dual-purpose rose water and I have realized, after the fact, that what I really need is a true hydrosol. Since I read the consistently high ratings for this brand at the time, though, and the budget friendly price, I decided to go with this one. I received it yesterday and used it last night in my face cleaning routine. The smell is okay. Maybe I just don't like roses as much as the next person. It was by no means offensive, but I personally wouldn't want to wear a perfume that smelled like this. I transferred this into a fine-mist spray bottle and spritzed it on after cleaning my face and neck and applying Hyaluronic Acid, and before my moisturizer. Since I have several steps in fighting the melasma, wrinkles, and adult acne, my face gets dry by the time I'm ready to put on my moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use it, as it does seem to keep the dryness at bay while I go through my routine. It is refreshing on the skin and I had no negative reaction to it.\nFor the dual-purpose part: I had Lasik eye surgery 10 years ago and I've been suffering from extremely dry eyes for about two years. I wanted something without all the synthetic ingredients that all the OTC drops have. Many people have commented that rose water drops are very good for dry eyes. Turns out, this rose water is just distilled water with rose essential oil added. I need to do some further research, but I don't think this is going to work. For skin moisturizing purposes, though, it's fits the bill.", "label": 2}

In fact, when trimming hair where there is sensitive skin, I find there is much less irritation than with a razor and other trimmers.\n\nMy HUGE complaint is the way the guards snap on. When you remove the guard, it sometimes pops the screen loose. I lost my first trimming screen 2 days after receiving the shaver after removing the guard. It went right into my sink drain.

{"text": "This is a review for the similar model 7745X. It appears the only difference is that the 7745X has a travel pouch and indicator lights.\n\nI bought this shaver because I was getting nicks several times every week when using the Mach3 / Mach3 Turbo blades. This shaver has addressed that problem, introduced another, and has not eliminated the need for blades.\n\nThe shaver does a decent job of shaving the hair off of my cheeks, mustache, and chin. Nowhere near as close as a blade, but nearly good enough (see below). The main problem is when I try to shave hair near my Adam's apple. I consistently end up with red abrasions that last most of the day.\n\nIn addition, the design of the shaver makes it unrealistic to shave sideburns. You'd have to disconnect the heads, connect a straight edge (which connects differently than the other heads), shave, and then re-assemble for storage.\n\nMy solution: Shave with this shaver. Then follow up with the Mach3 / Mach3 Turbo blades. This way, I can do the sideburns and Adam's apple area. I can also \"re-do\" the other areas for a closer shave, and for whatever reason, when I do it this way, I don't get nicked.\n\nOther positives: I really like being able to use it in the shower and wash it by placing it in the streaming water. The battery lasts a long time (at least 2 weeks), and the battery indicator is helpful as well.\n\nThe lotion dispenser is an interesting gimmick, but I find it totally unnecessary. It doesn't place lubrication on the heads; it just goes on your face, which then makes contact with the heads. Easier just to put something (like soap) on your face, and then use it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I picked this unit up so I can see how it shaves my boys.  The trimming attachment heads are not very useful in my opinion.  In fact, I would recommend trimming the hair down there to the shortest length possible first with a regular beard trimmer.\n\nShaving your skin smooth on the testicles and shaft is a chore.  It took way too many passes with this shaver to get the skin relatively smooth.  I understand if one is looking for absolute smoothness, then a manual razor is the way to go.  However, this products is touted as being ideal for shaving the groin area smooth, and in my opinion, this shaver does that job fairly.\n\nAs I mentioned, be prepared to spend some time down there going over the same spot to get it smooth, plus, you have to VERY careful not to nick yourself with this thing.  The trimmer things on each side of the unit can bite you if you are not careful enough to keep your skin taut while you go over an area.\n\nObviously everyone has different hair lengths and thicknesses on their body.  So even though I found this shaver to be simply adequate down below for me, it may work well or worse for others.  I'd recommend giving it a try yourself.  You don't have that much to lose because if you are unhappy with this unit, you can send it to Norelco within 60 days of purchase and they will refund your purchase price.\n\nI plan on trying the Remington BHT-2000 body shaver in the next month or two and will compare that unit against this one.\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI recently purchased the Remington BHT-2000 body shaver and have reviewed it.  Here's is an updated review comparing the Noreclo to the Remington:\n\nTo begin, I find the Remington to be more solidly built than the Bodygroom. Plus, the Remington's smaller design makes it easier to maneuver around the groin area than the Bodygroom for trimming that area. Advantage: Remington.\n\nSecondly, I find the trimming capability of the Remington to be better than the Bodygroom. What I don't like about the Norelco is that is comes with flimsy detachable heads to use for trimming. I like how the Remington has a dial-type head (similar to what you see in most beard trimmers) in which you can choose from 5 setting for hair trimming. Advantage: Remington\n\nThirdly, I found the shaving capability of the Remington to be quite poor compared to the Norelco. For either unit, it is recommended to trim the hair to the lowest setting before attempting to shave using the foil head. If you don't trim the hair first to as short as possible, the shaving head on each unit will not be able to shave the hair properly. Getting back to the review...the Remington dual head shaver attachment is unsatisfactory. It does not shave as close as the Norelco foil head, nor is it as irritation free as the Norelco foil head. I used the foil head on the Remington as gently as possible on both my testicles and part of the shaft, and I felt a stinging razor burn on two separate occasions. Eee-yowch. This did not happen with the Norelco Bodygroom. Advantage: Norelco.\n\nI would recommend that if you plan to simply trim your groin area, then your best bet is to go with the Remington as it is the better trimmer. If your desire is to shave your groin area as smooth as possible with an electric instrument, than your best bet is to go with the Norelco Bodygroom as it is the better shaver. Please understand, however, that even with the Norelco being used as a shaver, you will not experience a shave as close as you would by using a blade.\n\nBased on my experience, I find trimming the groin area to be the way to go instead of shaving the area. In order to keep the groin region hair free, you would have to shave that area every day. I find I can get by with trimming that area to a very short length once a week to keep it rather well maintained.", "label": 2}

{"text": "There have been a lot of complaints about the vacuum option of this trimmer.  Let's be realistic....its not a Hoover, it's a trimmer.  It catches MOST of the hairs, which is a lot better than NONE of the hairs.  I've used it a few times so far and haven't had the problem others complained about where the setting is changed mid-trim.  Just hold the thing below the dial, and not right on the dial.  It gave a nice even trim all around.  I've had it for a couple of months, used it 3-4 times, and still haven't had to recharge it.\n\nSuggested improvement - A stand would have been great so I could put it in my medicine cabinet and not have it roll around my counter.\n\nTips for using - I found you're better off with dry hair.  When the hair's wet, it's harder for the vacuum to pull it in.  I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  The dial goes 1-9 so I started with 4, which was way too short.  I could have grown that beard from scratch in a couple of weeks.  5 also proved a little short for me.  Be sure to start a lot higher than you think you need, and work your way down if needed.", "label": 2}

{"text": "After a year of a good grooming, the unit's switch suddenly got stuck in the \"on\" position. Middle of the night, total silence in the house.. Except for what sounded like a huge vibrator. Had to shove it under a pillow and wait till the batteries died. Arrrgh.\n\nNow, how do you fix that? Pretty simple. The switch is getting stuck because of the vacuum developing inside of the watertight container. The unit is getting hot in the shower, pressure inside increases, and it (somehow) releases that pressure. Eventually, you are getting enough vacuum to suck the membrane that covers the switch almost all the way in. All you have to do to fix that is let some air in.\n\nFirst, make sure the unit is dry in and out. Use a compressed air can to blow water drops out of hard to reach places if you have to. You don't want to let any water get inside! Now, remove the head. Just pull it out.\n\nNext, using a flathead screwdriver or utility knife, pull out those silvery colored side moldings. The case will open like a clamshell. You will find a fairly small watertight container with all of the electrical components inside. Carefully pull out any of the latches that are used to keep it closed. Pull two latches if that wasn't enough; your on/off switch membrane will immediately \"pop\" back into shape.\n\nReseal the unit back like it was before. Works like new!", "label": 2}

Like another recent reviewer, I have a heavy beard, and the shaver really struggles with it.\n\nI should mention that I'm not a new user. I've now owned mine for over a year. If you read the reviews, you'll see that there have been quality problems with batteries in this model. I got one of the bad ones. Norelco exchanged it under warranty. Annoying, but they didn't give me a hard time. The new unit's battery has behaved flawlessly, and holds a charge good for an absurdly large number of shaves.\n\nBesides the long battery life, a feature I *LOVE* is the ability to clean it under the sink. That is really handy, and not just hype.\n\nI haven't seen any mentions in other reviews of replacement shaving heads. Norelco recommends that you replace them yearly. Like the shaver itself, they're very costly. However, after I replaced them, I did notice an immediate improvement in the feel and quality of the shave.\n\nI think as you read the other reviews here, you may come to the conclusion, as I have, that if you have a heavy beard, this unit will give you a very good, but not great, shave. Combine that with the high initial cost of the unit and the high cost of yearly shaving head replacement, and I can recommend this only if you have a light to medium beard and really must have an electric.\n\nInstead, I STRONGLY recommend that you check out the Gillette M3Power razor if you want the best quality shave. It seems like a gimmick, but it works. It's so good that I have switched back to it, away from this electric unit. Not only is the quality better, but it only costs a fraction of this Norelco.", "label": 2}

If the BHT 2000 does break, I'll use the Philips until I can replace the Remington.  I would strongly recommend getting away from using a standard razor.

{"text": "Here is an update from Nov. 2015 -\n\nUnfortunately, it applies to the seller of this product, not to the product itself. I bought it at the beginning of October, and now 5 weeks later it still has not arrived from the UK to LA, CA. No tracking info, nothing to do about it, but to ask for a refund and never buy again.\n\nI purchased this product for the first time only recently, after doing some online research. I was looking for a healthy alternative to a brand that I used for almost a decade. I have about 20% gray hair, more so on my temples, and my natural hair color is dark brown. The Medium Brown 4N by Tints of Nature seemed to be the best match, so I gave it a try. I had nothing to lose but gray hair.\n\nWhen I got the package, I read everything on the box and in the instructions, just to make sure I'm not missing any warning, as we all know, these things always come with all sorts of warnings. Though, I did not do the allergy test 48 hrs ahead as I never had any allergy issues before, even with brands that are known to be less safe. And I did not regret it, because I had no issues at all. It's been now 5 days since I used it and I am completely fine.\n\nAs for the product, I instantly liked it. The color smells very nice, it does not have the typical chemical/toxic smell to it, and I did not even have to turn on the fan in my bathroom. The preparation time is just as with any other brand, as there are two bottles that need to be mixed well, and you are good to start with your journey. The mixed color paste is just thick enough that it does not drip from your hair, and still, you can run your comb through your hair if you need to. I also like that it is made of the certified organic ingredients, and that it has the least amount of the toxic ingredients, which they have to use in order for it to fully cover your gray hair. Be aware that this is not a 100% non-toxic/organic product, however, it is the least toxic permanent hair color that I could find on the market.\n\nIn addition, it is made in the UK, and to my knowledge, they need to comply with the much stricter EU safety standards, unlike US manufacturers. That fact alone gives me a piece of mind, as FDA has not changed their laws about the beauty products and their safety since the 70s.\n\nAnd the most important thing, the hair color came out beautifully. It has a warm tone of the dark brown shade, and it fully covered all my grays. My hair looks shiny and natural. The gray portion got a very slight tint of a dark brown with golden undertones, but they are still very well covered. No one would be able to tell that those were gray hairs at some point. The previous brand that I used to use would give me a very dark brown with black undertone, and it was a bit too dark. I love this product, it is the safest I could find, its packaging is made out of recycled materials, and they use organic ingredients, among other things.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is its price. It is about double of what other similar products cost and I have not seen it in any store in CA. Which means, there is shipping time to include in your wait, so I am about to order myself another box.\n\nI highly recommend this brand, and this is after using hair colors on and off for about past 20 years. I started experimenting in my teens, and by now I consider myself an amateur-pro, if there is such a thing.", "label": 0}

Needless to say, the pain I felt from the mustard bath water, on my scratches (and few cuts, to be honest) was immense. Later that night I had to resort to having my husband apply Vitamin E to my scratches -just so I could get some relief. The next day, I am still in pain.\n\nI'm not sure what went wrong. My bath water was sufficiently hot enough to dissolve the mustard bath. I used it one other time, with no issues. However, I am NEVER going to use this, in my bath, again.

So far in the last 5 years I have owned two of this product. The original one I purchased from Amazon, and the subsequent one from Wal-Mart.\n\nThe product works great at first. Knocks out the hair, works both wet and dry (though I never thought it worked very well wet), and recharges in a flash.\n\nUnfortunately, after a few months of use - the replaceable shaving piece came loose and would fall out whenever I turned the product upside down or when I hit a snag while using it that cause it to pop up a little bit. This makes using the product next to impossible if you're using it without a guard. I have even gone as far as replacing the entire shaving piece and the product still falls out. So it is the base shaver that has gotten loose and broken off a piece that stops the product from working as well.\n\nThis has happened to BOTH of the shavers that I have used and it starts to happen after about 6 months of use. All in all I like the product and for the price it works very well. It is because of these things coming loose that I have dropped it down 2 stars.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I purchased the three pack of the tea tree and hemp oil kind when it was still available on here for about $16.00 (though strangely enough the price randomly dropped since then). I've been trying to find a good alternative for my particular hair/skin type while being an all natural shampoo. I have adult acne and my hair gets greasy very easily, so I've always had difficulty with skin sensitivity and buildup on the scalp. To be specific, my skin is actually combination (oily and dry in some places), which complicates things all the more. That being said, if you don't have the same skin/hair type as me, then this may or may not apply to you...\n\nI was hoping to find a good enough alternative that it wouldn't matter if I skipped a day of hair cleaning (to keep some good natural oils in my hair) like a lot of people with non-oily skin can do. This is my first time using an all natural shampoo, let alone a shampoo bar (everyone I know looks at me like I'm crazy when I mention its form but I still like the idea), and I was intrigued enough after reading a lot of reviews on here and elsewhere.\n\nSo, I'm about halfway through my first bar and it's not quite met my expectations. It was ordered on June, 15th and I received it only a few days later and have used it up until this point every day or every other day. The bar does melt quite a bit even if you have it sitting on a surface where it's not submerged in a stagnant pool. A dry area. Instead of being the semi-solid form it was when I got it, it now has a waxy appearance... like golden melted wax formed into a halfway melted square shape. Melted beeswax is the closest comparison. This might not be unusual, since it's mostly oils, but it changes the way it feels when putting it into my hair. Also, I've found that it hasn't done anything to clear up the buildup on my scalp. Again, this could just be my own hair type, but it is strange that all these natural oils haven't done anything to help my dandruff. If anything, it may be slightly worse. Still, if you don't take your time in rinsing it out (emphasis on this right here), then it will leave most of, if not at least some of your hair very oily, which you'll notice when it dries. I've found the best way to do it is to let it sit in your hair for a good few minutes, then take a good five or so minutes of just rinsing, making sure to get everywhere more than once, since it does coat. I was wondering why my hair ended up oily a few times using this and discovered taking your time rinsing really does show the best results.\n\nAs for the good, I've noticed it does lather more than I expected despite no foaming agents, which I like. All you have to do is run it for a few seconds through each part of your hair and you're golden. Another positive is that it doesn't have a strong smell. The light smell it does have isn't half bad. Despite not showing too much improvement with my hair's condition versus store bought shampoos, on the bright side, it doesn't dry out my hair and at least it's all natural, right?\n\nEven when I clean it all out, unfortunately my hair isn't super luscious and silky smooth (someday...). It is soft though, but still fluffy. At least for the first 24 hours. Again, my hair gets oily easily, so I'm going to guess that this might just be the wrong combination of oils or perhaps I should stop putting off that visit to a dermatologist. Once I get through the three bars, I'll order a different kind of J.R. Liggett's and see if there's any improvement with a different kind, but for now, this is an \"okay\" buy.", "label": 2}

The pop-up trimmer works fine and the recharging stand is convenient.  I like the form-fitted case. The head opens too easily, so I'm forever cleaning up shaving stubble due to accidental openings.

The charger will not even register that the shaver is on there anymore and it has been well cared for. Such a shame. I can't find a replacement charger, so it looks like it's back to the old three blade disposable razor and cream for us.

{"text": "I've shaved with Braun electric models since early 1980's.  They were great products then, but their foil/cutter durability has degraded badly under Gillette, now P&G (they should give away the shavers, since they are really selling high-margin disposables.)  The thin foil and cutter are now designed to wear out rapidly: I shave carefully, have moderate beard growth, but still only get 4 to 5 months from a foil before it breaks and nicks.  Forget their 18 month change suggestion--it won't last that long.  If you don't mind the high expense of consumables, the 8000 series does provide a very clean comfortable shave while the foil is new.  I find shaving quite fast in the first month, considerably slower by 3rd month, then watchout for foil failure and nicks.  If you want durable performance, get a Norelco rotary.  When a Braun foil breaks, I use a 1960's vintage Norelco triple-head.  It still works just fine, and only costs electricity since the cutters last several years in daily use on my beard.  Its downside is manual cleaning, and a shave (old cutters/thicker foils) not quite as close as a new Braun foil/cutter.  It also takes a little longer than a new Braun foil/cutter to get a good shave, but it's faster than a 3-4 month old Braun f/c.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought an expensive Norelco \"Spectra\" about eight weeks ago. I don't find it better than my last new and expensive Norelco, a \"Quad Action,\" or whatever last year's \"Razor-du-Jour\" from Norelco was called, and I'm really disappointed.  Each year the Norelco offers less and less value.  (Ratio of quality to price.) It is not as close, and it takes longer to shave.  The only difference I can see is the little adjustment wheel, which they've had before in different forms, the pretty pearlized colors, and the the holes versus slots moved to a different location on the perimeter of each of the three circular heads. The holes are much closer shaving, as they have always been on foil razors. Norelco claims that the slots are better for \"longer hairs,\" but if you shave every day, why would you have \"longer hairs\" on your face? The bottom line is that this model is NOT faster or closer than the previous one, although it's a bit smoother, but it IS more expensive. I keep buying these in the hope that each successive one is actually an improvement, rather than a marketing device with marginal changes. (And the \"James Bond\" tie-in promotional gift is simply, well, juvenile.  Anyone old enough to shave can see this is useless and unrelated.  A small package of pre-shave, a shaving stick, or cleaning/soaking fluid would make more sense.)  But the truth of the matter in my experience is that any of the past three major models (\"Spectra,\" \"Quad,\" \"Reflex,\" whatever) are comparable if you use an appropriate pre-shave, clean the shaver often, and replace the heads as needed.  (The ability to rinse the razor clean WAS significant, however.)  The closest Norelco was the one with the micro-thin indentation in the center of each circular head around the perimeter. The fastest one had 36 (I think) cutting blades, instead of the reduced number now. (When I asked Norelco why they cut the number of blades, they said it had something to do with the \"hair reservoir.\" What happened to the hair before?) I will continue to use Norelco, and I own three of them.  I have used them for 48 years, and they're still the best rotary razor.

I then went to using the upper and lower strips separately, which was more comfortable (and no drool) but time-consuming.  It meant an hour at a time of whitening, twice a day.  After a few days I developed sensitivity in my teeth that I had never previously known, ever.  Just breathing with my mouth open made me wince.  I started using it only once every few days, instead of twice a day.  In the end I stopped using it because it caused me too much discomfort.

The remaining shave time indicator is very handy, but since the utmost requirement to a razor is the shaving quality, I wouldn't recommend it at this price. Despite the fact that I followed the charging instructions, after 2-3 months of usage, I can get 37-38 minutes at most. I was traveling with it in Europe (the electrical current in the countries I visited was ~220V/50Hz). Even though it is designed to be dual voltage, I never got over 34 minutes of shaving time.", "label": 0}

Before I put even the first day's strips on my teeth, I made sure to purchase some Sensodyne toothpaste, and I am so glad that I did. I followed the directions and put the strips on (without brushing first) and within the 30 minutes of applying them my teeth started getting painfully sensitive.

You still may need to hold your head close to the wastebasket if you want to keep a spotless bathroom. There is a little double ended brush included that is useful for cleaning out the trap. I was mostly disappointed with the charging system. The unit has one indicator that is on when charging. It doesn't tell you anything about if the unit is charged all the way or getting low. You are supposed to keep track of that yourself. Worst instruction was not to charge the unit more than 24 hours neglecting that people forget and may leave it plugged in for days since this is not a unit you need to use every day.

{"text": "If you don't own a Norelco triple-head razor, stop reading now and just buy one -- any one.  Or if you own an ancient Norelco double-header, or a triple-header before the Lift'n'Cut heads, sure, get a new one.  But if, like me, you have an old model, do your utmost to replace its parts and you'll be just as happy.  (I replaced heads and two solder-tab NiCd's.) Here's why (echoing other reviewers' sentiments):\n(i) This particular model is no faster than my old one, its \"Speed XL\" moniker notwithstanding.  Maybe that's because of the new blade size/design, or maybe the old motor turns faster. (Seemingly, old AC and NiCd models spin faster than old NiMH models; YMMV.)\n(ii) This model is no more adjustable (N/M/S) for closeness of shave than my old adjustable model (1-10).  The heads do indeed rock more than the old spring suspension, but I still must stretch my skin with the other hand to get a close shave over the bumps.\n(iii) The cleaning system leaves stubble-grit on the rubber bits.  Also mine required repairs after 5 months, because the washer mechanism got stuck.  (It has a 2-year warranty (yay!), alas they insisted on shipping the razor back, too (aargh!).)  Norelco's attempt to \"Gillette up a revenue stream\" with consumables, i.e. cleanser fluid, is a little transparent.\n(iv) The cleaning system leaves you with a damp razor, even if you shake it and let it stand for an entire day -- it's the shaving equivalent of a wet willie in the morning.  Worse, the small quantity of liquid remaining is just enough to create a jumpy slide across the face -- not as even as completely dry, nor as smooth as a lubricated wet shave.\n\nOn the plus side, the battery life on this razor is excellent, and longer than old Norelcos.  If you live out of a suitacase, you won't have to pack the cord.  Which is good, because the charger circuit has been pulled out of the razor body and into a wall wart.\n\nThe razor rates 4 stars (not 5 because they have made better razors before, and hopefully will hence).  The cleaning system gets 1 star.  So don't get a CC model, but definitely do buy a Norelco razor.  If you switch from blade or foil electric, please do as the manual says: give it two weeks of rotary use before judging the closeness of the shave.

The new model runs very slow, so I assumed it was due to also being directly operable at 220volt.  However my old 550TL operates at 220v as well, but still runs at nearly twice the speed of the new one.  The 6423LC does hug the contour of the face better and is quieter, but the shave quality is quite poor.  Requires covering the same area time after time after time...again and again.  If would not have purchased this shaver if I could have found the correct replacement blades again.\n\nFinally realized what is going on.  This shaver is designed to run from the lowest noted to the highest noted voltage, only because it will operate on 220 maximum.  What do I mean?  The motor runs less than half speed at the lowest voltage and full speed at 220v, thus the shaving head is proportionally as slow also at 120 volts, thus requiring twice the time to shave.  It should be fine at 220v, so if I even get to Europe, I am set.  Otherwise I am screwed.  Buy it if you want, but you have been told.

{"text": "The reason you see such variation in reviews for this product is because they\nhave changed their formulation.  I bought some about 18 months ago and it\nworked exceedingly well.  Recently I again had need for it.\nI had a tiny bit of Dentemp OS left that was still pliable so I used it\nand it lasted about 8 days which wasn't bad for 18 month old product.\n(When fresh it used to last about 2 weeks, just enough time to be able to\nset up a dental appt at a time both you and the dentist could manage.)\n\nThe NEW product however, is NOT the same as the older product.\nThe formulation has CHANGED! The pkg had the ingredients in a\ncompletely different order and the consistency and staying power\nare astronomically reduced.  Now it lasts about 12 hours per repair.\n(That's after putting it on just before bedtime and letting it set\nfor 8 hours before eating anything.)\n\nThis new formulation is as HORRIBLE as the former product was GOOD,\neven though the name hasn't changed, nor is there any indication that\nthere has been a change.  If I hadn't kept the old pkg, I wouldn't know\nWHY this stuff no longer works, but having the two ingredient lists side by side,\nclearly shows that the polymer, which was the 1st ingredient is now among the last.\nThis is the binding agent.\nSadly, what was once a great product is no longer worth your money at all.\n\nI'd attempted to contact the company and (not so) surprisingly, the web address\non the pkg is no longer operational. The email address for dentemp os customer service\nfound online at their parent company is no longer valid either. This can only lead me\nto one conclusion.  They realize they had a great product and decided to use the name\nand reputation they'd built to now sell their new inferior formulation while making\nsure they were not reachable for those who would take the time to register dissatsifying\nexperiences.\n\nYet again, a company has cheapened the product to the point of making it useless,\nwhile living off the good name they HAD been known for- AND while disabling their\ncustomer service so you are completely \"had\" by a legal con game.  This seems to be\nthe new American fraud that so many companies perpetrate against their formerly\nloyal clientelle.  No wonder America is failing economically and the American name\nno longer represents quality.\n\nSave your money, buy the cheap store brands, they are no better, but no worse either\nand are generally less costly and more easily available....\nor better yet, unless you can reapply this stuff 3 times or more daily, beg your dentist\nfor an emergency appointment, then hope you aren't charged extra for having to be squeezed in\nor for having your doc put in some extra hours for your emergency.\n\nGuess I feel a bit ticked off after thinking the new product would be as good as the old\nand thereby making my dental appt. for 2 weeks- when the doc and my own schedule aligned.\nNow, after getting this, I realize I'll be buying 1 of these (or some generic brand) per\nday until the timeof my appointment unless (hopefully) my dentist gets a cancellation.\n\nWhen they have a good product, why do they have to cheapen it and RUIN it?\n\nLook over the various reports on this here on Amazon. (There are different packaging options\nof the same product.  Some carry the old formulation on the listing, some not, but whether\nor not you'll actually GET the older product is anyone's guess)  Now you know why you see\na 5 star and a 1 star populace.  The 1 star reviewers are most likely using the new product\nwhile the 5 stars were fortunate to have gotten the last of the good stuff that they no longer make.", "label": 0}

I ordered this and the GiGi brand brazilian body hard wax for underarms/bikini.  This kit has a nice warmer, a nice small collection of various accompanying products (most of which aren't necessary to buy outright, the unit cleaner is just alcohol, and regular lotion works as well as several of their lotions).  The kit does not include the very important baby powder.  The detailed instructions that come with the kit are a very nice introduction to waxing, and they go over using a GiGi brand powder; however, the salons all use baby powder, and I was already prepared with this.  The cloth strips included were only enough to do both of my entire legs one time.  I used the hard wax (bought separately) first, and was thrilled with the results (I'll review that product under it's page).  The creme wax that came with the kit is another story.  This stuff is bad news.  I should have known when I first opened the canister, and felt it already pliable and sticky.  It was very difficult to spread on my legs, even more difficult to pull off.  This wax hurt way more than the traditional, and my legs were left with BRUISES and parts where the skin was pulled up.  The sticky wax gets everywhere, and unlike the hard wax that is easy to scrape up and throw away when it dries, this stuff stays sticky.  I used the bottle of cleaning solution very fast, luckily I read that it was just alcohol, and got out my own bottle.  I spent over 2 hours cleaning that pink stuff off the linoleum (and my cat's neck-- oops), and that bathroom is STILL sticky!  I'm letting some dirt get on the sticky spots so it will be easier to clean now.  I threw away the cannister of creme wax-- that's how bad it was.

{"text": "I went to this after using a Braun Cruzer which had a trimmer attachment which was MUCH closer, but unfortunately broke after I stupidly put it in my checked luggage during a transatlantic flight.\n\nSo I decided to get this Norelco for its vac feature because with the Braun, it was kind of a pain to clean up all the little hairs on the sink after each use.  The vac feature works well, gets about 95% of the whiskers.\n\nThe main drawback with the Norelco however is that with the adjustable guard off, it doesn't provide nearly as close a trim as the Braun.  I confirmed this by looking closely at both products' trimmer blades.  The distance between the stationary and the moving blade on the Braun was maybe 1mm; on this Norelco T980, it was more like 3mm.  So if you're buying this trimmer in order to cultivate a stubble look, be aware that with the T980 you'll have to use it more often.\n\nThe vacuum intake vent makes it a bit harder to maneuver the trimmer as well.\n\nAnother annoyance is that it doesn't get the occasional whisker that lies almost flat to the skin without repeated passes.  This is probably the result of the aforementioned greater distance between the edge of the stationary and moving blades.\n\nSo, this has been my main disappointment with this product.  To get a closer shave, I had to use the smaller mini-trimmer attachment which unfortunately doesn't work as well with the vacuum, so a lot more hairs were all over my sink.  Plus was a bit uncomfortable in that sometimes it would catch on my skin more than the normal sized trimmer attachment.\n\nThe Norelco is also bulkier and less ergonomic than the Braun, but I guess that's the price of having the vac feature.\n\nSigh, if only Braun would make the same trimmer with a vacuum function!  I'd snap that baby up in a heartbeat.\n\nOr maybe the truth is that *I* am paying a high price for my laziness regarding cleaning up post-shave whiskers off the sink myself, vs. having a lower-quality trimmer with a vac function.

{"text": "I have fairly sensitive skin and have tried a variety of methods to shaving, none of which have been satisfactory.  Among the multi-blade razors, I found the Schick Quattro to be the best.  In combination with a fine shaving brush and soap, it worked pretty well.  But it was too time consuming, and rather messy.  For years, I'd been a Braun electric razor user and had been using the Braun Syncro for the past 2 years.  But it was rather rough on my face, even after replacing the blades, loud, and cumbersome to clean.  Then I discovered the Norelco Spectra line, which seemingly had all the features I'd been looking for.  I'll just sum up what features mattered to me and how I rate them.\n1. Shaving Closeness: Good\nNorelco recommends 3 weeks of exclusive use for your face the adjust to the shave.  I'd been testing out an older Norelco Quadra razor I had, so though I only used the Spectra for a week, I think my face was adjusted fine.  It did a fairly decent job, though I still had to stretch my chin area to get the closest shave.  But for the upper lip area, I still can't figure out how to get it to shave as close as a foil shaver, like the Braun.\n2. Comfort: Very Good\nMy old Norelco Quadra used to literally pull the hair and it would hurt!  The Braun was abrasive and I'd often need to put on some lotion afterwards.  But I thought the Spectra was very comfortable and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  However, I could not tell much of a difference in the 7 \"Comfort\" settings, even when I went from the highest to the lowest setting in comparing this feature.\n3. Ease of Cleaning: Excellent\nDoes it get any better than just rinsing the heads with water?  The Braun system of cleaning is just plain inefficient and costly.  Why keep a hideous cleaning stand around and pay for the cleaning solution, when you can just rinse with water?\n4. Display:  Excellent\nOnce you get past the wow factor of how nice the polymer LED looks, it's not much more than just a simple indicator of how long your battery will last.  The other indicators I don't find as useful, though some might.\n5. Noise: Excellent\nCompared to the Braun, it's like shaving in stealth mode.  I never realized that electric razors didn't all sound like gas lawn mowers.\n6. Battery Life: Undeterminable\nThe major reason I decided to get \"James Bond's Shaver Of Choice\" over the less expensive model just below it, was that the 8894XL has 100 minute shaving time, as opposed to the 70 minute shaving time of the 8890XL.  As it turns out, the unit I received is defective.  I charged it as the manual suggests and after 4-5 charging cycles, I couldn't get the razor to operate for more than 6 minutes before dying.\nMy choice for electric razors is Norelco, easily.  But I don't plan to replace my defective unit with another 8894XL.  I don't find the differences between it and the 8890XL to be enough to justify the cost difference (only thirdy dolores on Amazon actually).  But considering my 8894XL had charging issues, I don't feel like going through another return, if I get another defective one.  As soon as I receive my credit, I will probably order the 8890XL.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I can understand the preference of taking some potentially harmful additive out of the lotion recipe.

{"text": "I bought this to replace my Remington MB400 trimmer which I really liked. Unfortunately, after years of use, the battery will no longer hold a charge for more then a couple minutes. That's unfortunate because the titanium blades still cut well. I liked the MB400, because it gave me a close stuble shave, its vacuum worked well and it stood upright, taking up less space on my small sink. Since this model is no longer available, (I would have bought it again), and since Remington, no longer offers a vacuum trimmer for some odd reason, I had to look elsewhere.\nI was somewhat reluctant to buy the Norelco T980, because I had Norelco rotary razor years ago which I hated. However, I chalked that up to not liking the rotary system and this trimmer had some good reviews.\nThe trimmer is a sleek black color, comes with a carrying case, and in general looks well built. The battery much to its credit also holds a charge well. I've used it multiple times and I still haven't had to recharge it yet.\nThe trimmer has been a disappoint overall though, mainly because unlike my previous trimmer it does not provide a close stuble shave. This may be a non issue for some buyers if they are only looking to trim longer hair, however it is a critical issue for me as I tend to use my trimmer as my primary shaver, and keep a seperate foil shaver for days I need a cleaner shave. This trimmer simply does not cut close enough with either of the provided heads. The smaller trimmer head also cuts rough and felt more uncomfortable.\nThe vacuum works well, but the blue collection piece gets in the way when shaving, and also causes the vacuum to miss some. The plastic collection door on  front front flips open, but stays hinged and thus gets in the way, when you are trying to empty hair.\nThe blue turbo button on front changes the whir of the motor, but I didn't notice any difference in shave.\nOverall, this is probably a decent to good trimmer for longer hair lengths, but if you are looking for anything nearing a close shave, avoid this model.\nI will be getting a different model due to the closeness issue.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I understand that there are differing opinions on this trimmer, but after using it back to back with the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer, there is no comparison on the following counts:\n\n1)  quality of the trimming accessories - the Norelco has a flimsy cutting guide, and its all on the verge of breaking everytime you use it.  Anyone who has had a previous Norelco product points this out.\n\n2)  a ridiculously designed sideburn trimmer - It is so hard to get the trimmer set-up!  a poor design\n\n3)  A terrible cut - if you have even a medium beard, the trimmer is very uneven. you can certainly do better.\n\nThe items above are enough to walk away from this device.  The reviews that critique the vaccuum are probably being unrealistic.  It is in part Norelco's fault - they set you up to expect more from the vaccuum than you get.

{"text": "This popped up in my gold box, and I decided to give it a whirl since the idea of trimming my beard with no mess had a lot of appeal. The vacuum does half work.  Unfortunately, catching half the mess won't change the need for clean-up--there's less to clean, but you'll still need to do it.  So my main recommendation is that you shouldn't let the vacuum \"feature\" be your reason for buying this.  If anything, it's a slight negative, because the opening for the vacuum gets in the way when you are doing edge trimming without the attachment.\nThe next down-side is the \"memory\" rechargeable batteries.  Basically, unless you let the batteries completely discharge before recharging, they will hold less and less charge each time.  This is mentioned in the folded up piece of paper that passes for a manual--you will want to read through that.  Which leads me to my final gripe:  That piece of paper is extremely poorly done--diagrams with no explaination, unclear instructions, etc.  So you do have to read it, but you're going to spend some time trying to puzzle it out before you actually figure it out.\nFor all my complaining, the trimmer isn't completely without merit.  It does do a decent job of trimming my beard, which is of course the main point of the thing.  I also didn't have any real noise complaints, which seems to be an issue for other reviewers.\nOn balance though, my main recommendation would be don't pay for the vacuum, because you won't be getting what you paid for.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I've been using the Norelco for about a month now.  I had previously used the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite (stolen out of my luggage at the airport), so I will use that as a basis for comparison.  I have somewhat sensitive skin; I did go back to a Gillette Fusion razor for a month in between electrics.\n\nCost:\n$129 Panasonic\n$80 Norelco (Sale Price)\n\nAesthetics:\nThe Norelco is a better looking razor imo, with a nice charging base.  The clock is a cool feature.  Norelco looks better on the counter.  Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic.\n\nFeatures:\nBoth had sensitivity settings and LCD battery monitors.  Found the sensitivity settings helpful for the initial break-in period on both.  Panasonic was wet/dry.  Norelco is not.  Norelco comes with a nicer travel case.\n\nBreak-in:\nPanasonic took two weeks before redness subsided.  Comfort level was fine.  Redness subsided after a week with the Norelco.\n\nComfort of Shave:\nAfter the break in period both provided a comfortable shave with little or no irritation.  The Norelco will catch and pull a hair once in a while but its not a big deal, but I have to be careful around my lips with the Norelco or it will pull and cut them.  That didn't happen with the Panasonic.\n\nCloseness of Shave:\nPanasonic wins hands down, its not even close.  With the Norelco I'll have to do a touch up at night (after morning shave) if I want clean shave look.  Wasn't needed with the Panasonic.\n\nEase of Shave:\nPanasonic wins again; much quicker shave.  So far I'm not a big fan of the rotary style.  I have to go over area's multiple times, and its tougher to get the tight/close spots.  Shaving takes at least double the time with the Norelco.\n\nBattery:\nNorelco has a longer battery life, however you have to be careful not to overcharge it.  You can't just leave it on the charger and go to bed; you have to remove it when its fully charged, or you'll damage the battery.  A big pain if you ask me.  Didn't do this with the Panasonic.\n\nCleaning:\nPanasonic was wet/dry, Norelco is not, but both can be cleaned simply by running under water.  Really not much different.\n\nValue:\nI wish I had gone for the more expensive Panasonic again, but the Norelco does a good enough job that its not worth buying another razor.  I would probably think the Norelco was great if I never had used the Panasonic.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I originally bought this cleansing cream to remove makeup and dirt like a cold cream. I have been stripping my face using harsh cleansers and wanted to ease up yet still get rid of makeup at night. This cream kind of confuses me. It does seem to remove makeup, including mascara and liner, well. But then I end up having to wash my face after because it leaves an oily residue which is not good for my skin. It's mineral oil  which is like a barrier which keeps moisture out but, at the same time, keeps it in as well.  It forms a sort of seal between your skin and anything you put on it and anything that is under it. Anyone who is prone to clogged pores will probably break out if they leave this on their skin.\n\nHowever, this brand is certainly not the only cream cleanser to use mineral oil as its main hydrator and cleanser. When I use this Queen Helene Cream, I always rinse it off so I am still washing my face like I was but at least the product is hydrating and not harsh. It doesn't strip my face of its natural oils and, when I wash it off with a warm washcloth, my face feels soft.\n\nBut what I really wanted was a no rinse cleanser for those lazy nights when I want to remove make up and dirt and hydrate all in one step. I may be able to leave this on my skin and not have issues but I prefer to remove the oil and use something a little more aging skin friendly. Still, if you're looking for a creamy cleanser that gets the job done and is cheap, this does work. I will use what I have but I don't think I will replace it when it is gone.", "label": 2}

The whole thing feels flimsy. With the only exception of the motor, which sounds more solid and together than the 6886XL. The worst parts are the trimmer on the back and the charger and the power cord. It makes me wonder just how long this thing is going to last. My 6886XL worked for me faithfully for 8 years. Never replaced anything. The battery is dying, instead of lasting 35 min as it did in the beginning, it now last about half that much, not bad after 8 years. I left it charging long after it's full for countless times. The blades gets dull. But still, shaved with the new 8171, the old 6886, and Braun 7505, I'd say the Braun is the closest and loudest. The Braun looks balky and its plastic feels cheap. But better than this new 8171XL! Norelco seems to have gone hip-pop, with the new color and design, cheap everything and all. I'm going for the lesser evil - Braun 7505. The German one feels like it will last longer than the Norelco and it looks more like a honest shaver.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you want something good for a couple of month before you get tired of it and switch, it's not bad. It works as good as my 8 year old 6886Xl, but no better.\n\nIf you are into something solid and reliable for the long term, try other brand.\n\nWithout real competition in its rotary niche, it's no surprise that Norelco goes the way it does today. But very disappointing to me nevertheless. I am returing the new 8171 tomorrow...", "label": 2}

I don't have a heavy beard by any means, and yet this thing still managed to yank out every hair on my neck, one by one it seemed. The only thing consistent about this razor was the razor burn it gave me every single day. The lotion dispenser is difficult to press while shaving and you need multiple presses for the entire shave. Not to mention the refills are quite expensive for something that is basically just lotion. Using this in the shower only made the shave worse as the hairs on my face swelled and were harder to cut by this already useless product. I only continued to use this because I don't have enough time before work to wet shave and I didn't have the money for anything else.

It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I'll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\n\nWell, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past.

I like the floating head, and the fact that it can be rinsed with water easily.\nI wish it had a battery that was less prone to memory problems so I could leave it plugged in every day.  There is no meter to let you know when the battery is low, or when it will give out.  The battery giving out while on the road is unaccceptable.  I am unaware of a car charger cord being available, but it would be nice.\nDo not leave this razor in the car over a cold night, or the battery will go dead.  There is no warning when the battery dies, the razor does not slow down, or beep, or any such thing - it just stops!\nIt seems that with the amazing performance of some other types of batteries in items like digital cameras and cell phones Norelco could have improved this aspect of their product.\nOverall, I do like this razor, especially for the relatively small price I paid for it!", "label": 2}

All 3 still heat up very hot, each iron has 10 rows of teeth around the barrel; between all three irons there are 30 rows of teeth, 20 rows are completely devoid of any teeth, only  2 rows remain whole. Beware, the teeth on all three were immediately brittle and within 3 weeks of each purchase I only had about half of the teeth left on each row. I have been unable to locate replacement teeth. It's  pretty sad I can't even find a phone number for their customer service. Called one number but they said they only dealt with professional products, so I guess they consider Amazon Prime members chopped liver.\nWhy have I waited so long to review? As an event planner, I've lived my career on the road with not a lot of personal time. Now I've retired and cleaning out and catching up with correspondence.  Amazon Prime has always been amazing with their product availability and shipping, but sometimes the products aren't worthy of keeping them in stock. This would be the case with model 1514. Unfortunately it's the largest brush style barrel I've been able to find the was electric not powered by hot air. Occasionally I still use these because the do get very hot, but I always burn either my fingers or my arm. These would be perfect for those of us with long hair if the teeth would hold up to the heat of the iron.

{"text": "The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)", "label": 1}

Derma/e might be good, but instead of buying Derma/e, do as I have stated/explained above and see if this does not work for you.

The Bodygroom has some good points and some bad.\n\nIt does shave, and pretty much delivers results like an electric shaver for your face, but for your body.  That is to say, it won't work well on longer hairs, but is good for upkeep.  The first few times you use it, you'll miss a lot and it won't seem very close.  That improves over time, just like a 'standard' electric razor you might use on your face.\n\nI love the fact it's water-resistant.\n\nI found the guards difficult and ineffective, but I haven't tried them much.\n\nMy biggest complaint?\n\nWell, I bought it to shave the lower part of the shaft of my penis and my testicles (well, scrotum I guess, since that's on the outside).  Notoriously difficult to shave with a razor.  I was really looking forward to not having to razor my parts anymore.\n\nThis cut me.  Twice.\n\nNow, I've \"figured it out\".  Somewhat surprising me, it was on the shaft and not my sack (which I would have figured to be more susceptible, given the nature of the skin).  It had to do with my \"angle of approach\" and the swiftness/firmness of my pressure.  I've corrected for that, and no longer had any gouges taken out of my penis.  That's a good thing.\n\nSo I give it three stars, in all fairness, trying not to weigh to heavily the fact that it cut one of my more tender areas.

Another issue with all Norelcos is that monthly or so you're supposed to take the heads out and clean them individually, taking care not to mix the rotors with the wrong screen.

My hair is a medium golden-brown and I was aiming for a darker golden-brown.

About 60% colour remained at 3-4 weeks.\n- Greys were covered adequately.\n- Condition was bearable. Hair was 'squeaky' and tangled easily, rather than soft and silky, and the ends were suffering, but all of this was less severe than with some other chemical dyes.\n- No allergies or irritation.\n- After 3+ months of using this product once every 3-4 weeks my HAIR WAS FALLING OUT at such a rate that my hairdresser panicked and wanted me to see a doctor!  My hair became so thin it was ridiculous.  I had to stop using the product.\n\nAt this point I officially gave up on chemical hair dyes!  I researched how to use a mix of natural Henna, Indigo and Amla herb powders.  This has been freakin' fantastic!!!  My results are:\n\n- Hair loss normalised within 2-3 weeks.\n- Condition is superb - silky, soft, full.\n- Colour is natural-looking and very resilient - 90% remaining after 3-4 weeks.\n- Grays are adequately covered.\n- I am not doing untold damange to my health and the environment by using gross chemicals.\n\nI WILL NEVER LOOK BACK.  I am actually ashamed that I was so ignorant of this awesome, far superior option for safely colouring hair!  For anyone whose hair is on the spectrum of 'stawberry blonde - copper - auburn - brown - black' (i.e. everyone except blondes) I cannot recommend highly enough that you dump chemical colours and learn to mix and use henna/indigo/amla at home.

I did notice sensitivity but it wasn't that painful, but my fingers were stinging really badly when I didn't wash them right away after applying them.\n\nI was only semi-pleased with the results only because of a few factors I encoutered. Part of my teeth weren't white enough, like the ones at the ends. This was due to the problem that I didn't position the strips perfectly and the ends usually start falling off. It did make my teeth a little whiter but not completely white, I'm not sure if a second box of that will help. It would be nice if extra stripes were given for free just to practice putting it on.\n\nI was happy with the results for about a month. My only discouragement is how can I maintain that result if I drink coffee and tea everyday?

{"text": "I bought a T800 quite a few years ago when I found the Austrian-made unit on sale at the local Target store. It lasted very well, and I was somewhat disappointed when the battery eventually would no longer accept a charge, though it continued to work while plugged in.\nAfter carefully looking into alternatives, I went with a T970 from Amazon.com, hoping for the same quality. Major letdown! This Chinese-made unit just is not up to the same standard as my T800. The charger is a seperate seperate and bulky transformer, instead of the simple cord of the T800. The T970 is larger, more awkward to hold and to use, and more fragile in every possible way. The vacuum, which was one of the initial attractions, works, but only marginally well, and the unit is unstable when laid down on a solid surface. If the mile-long charging cord is attached, expect to have to prop the unit against a wall to prevent it rolling over.\nI spent $6.00 on a top-quality replacement cell for my T800 (shipping was $4.00, for a 700mA Sanyo AA), and after careful disassembly and reassembly, successfully replaced the ailing cell without breaking anything. Unbelievably, The T800 now outlasts the T970 two-fold.\nI wish I'd stuck it out with the T800 in the first place.\n.\nUpdated June 29, 2009.\nAfter about two years of irregular use and the resulting regular complete self-discharges, the T970 stopped functioning even while plugged in, unless first given time to recharge. Initial time to start working after plugging in has increased to the point where it no longer works even being plugged in for 24 hours.", "label": 0}

With the T-860, i was able to use it even when i was charging. The T-860 battery ran out while ago, it won't hold the charge anymore but i can still plug it in and use it. Therefore, when the battery fo the T770 is dead, you can't use it anymore.\n\nHere is the very bad part: Once the battery is dead (won't hold charge anymore), you WILL have to DISCARD the T770. The directions clealy says that you will have to dispose the battery and DISCARD the trimmer. I don't know how many times i can charge the battery. It takes about ten hours to fully charge it and once charged it lasts over a month (i use it about three days a week).\n\nIt also has a two year warrenty.

Being battery-operated was nice, I didn't have to worry about the cord getting in the way.\n\nCons:\nThe plastic guard on it is very odd, it slides up and down for different lengths and it doesn't \"pick up\" the hairs to be trimmed. So most of the hair is still laying flat and doesn't get cut. It took MANY passes over the same areas and pulling the skin very taut, sometimes holding hairs straight up to get them to go through the guard, to get a half-way decent trim. It was still very uneven though.\n\nOverall, this would be ok for touching up, but I won't be using it when I need to get the full \"haircut\". If the guards were the normal ones that snap on and off like hair clippers, this would be perfect.\n\n(Also, do NOT use this without the guard, it will pull hairs and nick skin.

This planner is small and durable so it won't get beat up along with everything in my purse which is great but it's also large enough to have plenty of room to plan out my days. Each month starts with a monthly overview in which each dated square has lines to write within, I'm a messy writer if I don't have lines so this was a big draw for me when it came to choosing a planner. After the overview page, each week is laid out over 2 pages with the most space being devoted to Mon-Fri and again, each dated box is lined allowing me to really plan out my day effectively. At the back of the planner there is several pages for notes and a laminated listing of holidays and even a US map showing states, capitals & time zones which I thought was pretty cool. In the front of the planner you have a yearly overview of 2016 and 2017 which is always a plus to have and there's a few pages for profile info, emergency contacts, and general contacts. I'd say the only downside that I found was that the monthly pages go only through Dec 2016.

What I didn't expect was for this thinner not to work -- at all! I tried fewer drops; I tried more drops. Nothing. My thickened polish gets this watery wet look to it as the thinner settles over it, but it stays thick and gooey. The thinner just doesn't seem to penetrate the thick polish no matter how much rolling or shaking I do.

This shaver has 3 rows of rotating blades which cut perfectly well but don't do as well as a good foil shaver in my case, even after the 21 day recommended break in period. You might need that much time to adjust but you'll know up front how any shaver will perform new as it is the sharpest. There is a lot of plastic and cheap feel but the heads and motor seem well built. I compared this shaver to my Panasonic pro curve linear and Braun activator. Both shavers did much better overall than the Norelco. The Braun is decent but the head quality is not the best. The Panasonic, on the other hand, did very well and seemed much better in quality. There's nothing really wrong with the Norelco and I can recommend it if you must have a rotary. If you don't, the Panasonic is the best going. Meanwhile the Norelco must be used with care and they're a bit pricey. Make sure to stock up on Remington's shaver saver spray.

Also, if I skipped 2 days shaving so my beard was a little longer, it would pull the hairs really badly and hurt to shave with. The shape of the heads made shaving my sideburns (along my ear) and under my nose difficult and I always had to clean up those areas with my Mach3.

After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far!  I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review.

It's far enough away from the cutters to make trimming easy, and it does wonders for my skin as a pre-shave in case I missed a day. That might actually be the best part of the product.\n-It's very quiet. I can shave at night without disturbing anyone. My last shaver sounded like a wood chipper, so this is a welcome feature.\n-Cleaning isn't much of a hassle. (This isn't a great pro, but it is worth mentioning.)\n-Affordable, which is probably why I'm not sending it back. If I spent $100+ on it, it wouldn't be in my house right now, but the current price is what attracted me in the first place.\n\nCons:\n-To be honest, it doesn't really come through with a complete or very close shave. It still leaves many hairs, especially on my neck, and I can still feel a little bit of stubble, even after going over my skin enough times to chop it to bits.\n-Irritation is still a problem. I have the unfortunate combination of coarse hair and sensitive skin, so it's very hard to get a close and comfortable shave. This doesn't help. I end up cutting myself about half the time in order to get a full shave, and in some cases, the razor burn is brutal. I find myself applying aftershave at least twice after a regular shave.\n-The design makes it difficult to shave particular places, like under my sideburns and above my mouth. Having a wide face is good for shaving a larger surface area, but it makes finer shaving a bit clumsy.\n\nHonestly, this unit should be better. If I didn't need a new foil on my old razor (which would be about $30 after shipping), I would almost be financially obligated to send this one back. For its main functions, it really isn't an improvement on my old razor, which is disappointing when you consider that this is new and carries a trusted brand name.

It whitens my teeth after the first use, and the result became very obvious after 3 uses (as it claims), so I'm pretty satisfied.\n\nTray Design:\n\nThe tray fits my mouth quite well (but I have a small mouth... I even wonder how it would fit bigger mouth since the tray is kinda small.) Spreading the gel so that it fully covers the teeth isn't easy. I noticed that the top part of the teeth are whiter than the bottom (especially the bottom teeth.)\n\nSide Effect:\n\nThe gel DOES hurt the gum. I read other reviews and people have been complaining about bleached gum. My gum didn't get bleached, it didn't turn white, but it bled!!! The part of the gum closest to the teeth turned red because of the bleeding and there's also minor peeling of the gum too. It hurt pretty bad when I brushed my teeth. The bleeding only happened the first two times... I guess my gum got used to the gel since it didn't bleed after the third time (however, still hurt a little.)\n\nBottom line:\n\nIt does the job. It whitens your teeth, but comes with a price... hurts your gum!\n\nSo, here's what I do:\n\nThe first two trays I used them two days in a row (like the instruction says) and on the second day, it's really painful on the gum.

The course nature of beards really makes this impossible without a shear that connects to your shop vac.  It is kind of flimsey too.

The booklet says to use only the electric shaver for 3 weeks straight to give your skin time to adjust; but not only wouldn't this thing shave my neck decently, it actually caused a nasty rash to develop as well. I had to use Lanacane for a week to get rid of it. This Norelco model will be my last attempt at using an electric shaver (I tried a high-priced Braun as well, with similar results).

The Norelco 7735x gives a decent shave, but not one that you are going to get really close, especially if you want to do a \"dry\" shave.  Using the gel or lotion really helps out.  I found that the lotion works better.  Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results.\n\nThe shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer.  The triple blades make it difficult to get under above your lip and I seem to have to get a disposible razor to get right under the nose.  It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave. Overall, not a bad shave considering I paid about $35 for a reconditioned one.

I guess the warning beep might be good, but I'm not lazy enough to not clean it after each shave, so I'll never hear it.\n\nThe power button is in an inconvenient location, which makes it easy to turn the power off while attempting to shave.\n\nI didn't understand why a clock was built into the base. If you want a clock where you shave, you probably already have one. If you don't, this clock may be ok. If you want a clock to tell actual time, this is not the one. It has one little mark at the top where the twelve would be and nothing else. Norelco should have forgotten the clock and trimmed the price.\n\nThe recharge notification is a good feature. According to the manual the minutes-used feature needs to adjust to your shaving pattern, so I've only had the opportunity to hear it one time. It did go from five minutes left to zero without any additional shaving time being used to warn me that it was time to recharge it. I suppose it was adjusting to my pattern because the minutes available after that charge were less than after the initial charge.\n\nThe trimmer works well on sideburns, ears and nose.\n\nI decided to go with the more expensive model because I wanted the flexible heads that would adjust to the contours of my face and did not want a rubber exterior. I think it does that.\n\nI would like to see a shaver that does not have as many needless features, but has all of the good features of this model at a lower price.\n\nI would have rated it four stars if the price had been lower or if all of the features had a good purpose. I would have rated it five stars if all of the features had a good purpose and the price had been lower. The price here is as low as I could find it, so the price is a result of Norelco's pricing.", "label": 2}

They did not remove the hair as promised, and I'm not especially hairy.\n\nThe problem is that these don't separate evenly after warming so you get one strip that has enough wax and another that doesn't.  They're supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn't enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone the five or six the directions say you should get.\n\nNot having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn't know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax.

This shaver does NOT irritate at all, which is a good thing, considering I have really sensitive skin.  Just for fun, I shaved my face again with my Braun Synchro, to my surprise, I heard cutting noise...  Apparently, the Braun can save even closer than the Norelco.  After a quick shave with the Braun Synchro, my face felt even more smooth.  I am not pro Braun per se, but it seems the Braun Synchro shaves way better.  One more thing, if you keep certain facial hair, like goatee, you will find the big head of the Norelco to be a problem, you can't get a precision shave, where as the Braun has a narrow rectangle shaving surface, is much easier to control.

If you have a beard and a moustache a requirement for this kind of device is that it be able to trim at various lengths and then be able to have the length comb removeable. I found the pieces very hard to disassemble/reassemble for use. It would take many tries to get the thing back together.\n\nThen pieces started falling off the unit.

{"text": "Let's start with this fact: the Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom works great right out of the box. Just charge it up, slap on your preferred guard size, and start grooming. It gets to the hard to reach areas and, with some stretching, can even get the center of your back! It's easy to use and easy to clean. No problems. Best trimmer of its kind.\n\nThe issue comes when you've had the groomer for six months or more. If you have to change guards often (as in, you want to use #1 for \"the boys\", but #2 for the rest of your body, and #3 for calves and forearms). The guards snap onto the groomer using a notch-and-nub system that, for a time, works great. But over time, after snapping on and off, these notches wear out. Eventually any amount of pressure on the tip of the guards will result in your guard popping off and BUZZ you get a big bald spot on your body.\n\nIt's particularly annoying to be in the middle of a very visible area (like your chest) and have the guard pop off. The reward is a large spot that looks totally ridiculous. This is a design flaw that should be remedied with any future models. The guards need to be more secure... perhaps a slot on the sides upon which you slide the guards onto the unit?\n\nAdditionally, the rechargeable battery eventually loses steam after a few months of use. After a year of use, I am lucky to get 10 minutes of charge out of it. That makes grooming particularly inconvenient. I have to do it in stages. Chest one day, back another, and so on.\n\nIt would be nice if a) you could buy new guards separately from the unit (in the even that you lose them or they wear down as described above) and b) if you could buy a new battery for the groomer.\n\nOverall, I will buy another Bodygroom Shaver, but I do it begrudgingly with the knowledge that I will run into these issues again a year from now.", "label": 2}

I thought maybe it was just old, but the next three were the same way - brittle, crumbling etc. Adding moisture to the putty made it worse. Handling it made it worse. Even the most minimal action of making a ball (per directions) to apply this to the tooth made the product drier.\n\nDigging down to the bottom of the miniscule little container I found some putty that was almost moist and was able to fashion a bit of a repair. It lasted less than one minute. I got a second container. It was drier than the first. I went back out and got the product from two other stores in case I happened upon a bad case at the one store. Nope. All the same.\n\nI now have a second piece on the tooth and am hoping it *takes* and stays on long enough to create a barrier to protect the tooth. I tried both the thin and thick application (it doesn't take much and it's not supposed to - three paper sheets thickness is all you need. Enamel is not supposed to be a 1/4\" thick!) and had no luck with either.\n\nThe hassle of contacting the company may/may not be worth it if FOUR caps of the product from (1) Walmart, (2) Two from Food Lion and (3) CVS were all equally dry and inadequate.

{"text": "As a proud owner of three or four (lost count) bodygroomers in eight months, I think I have assessed the overall performance of this product.  In short, the product works, and does not tear up your nut sack as one review indicated.  The shave is close, but this hunk of junk breaks in a variety of ways.\n\nNow, the first shave is obviously uncomfortable because your body is not used the rigors of electric razors hitting those special spots.  (Using a scissor or side burn shaver to take out long body hair is a real good idea, as the bodygroomer's strength is being sensitive and shaving close rather than taking out large quantities of hair.)  You get a real strange feeling after the first shave.  However, my skin got used to it rather quick and the more often you shave the less irritation you get.  The product takes out chest and ab hair easily, and same with the butt.  However, one has to acquire a little bit of skill to negotiate the bean bag.  Product shaves the butt good too!  Have no idea about the back because I have no hair there but probably have to stretch like you do with your bar of soap/body sponge in the shower.  But after some practice this is done easily.  The battery last for fifty minutes, so if you use it until it is dead you pretty much only have to charge it once a week.  For a closer shave, use a product like Lectric shave on the areas you will shave before you shave, and rubbing alcohol on the parts you shaved after you are done to reduce irritation.  (I could see how this is painful but once you get over putting blades on your sack...)\n\nThe part that sucks about this product is that it is such typical made in China junk.  I have had not one of these that lasted two years, as they usually become unusable after two to three months.  The foil head can break and try to slip its way off slowly which is bad.  Another is that the head slowly detaches more easily from the unit until the point it falls out.  It's one thing if you got a good year or two out of it, but I have returned a bunch of these to Walmart already for a full refund, only to walk out with a new bodygroom.  One has never lasted long enough to test whether or not it was truly maintenance free.\n\nWell, life was easier when shaving body-hair was considered \"gay,\" but now since we live in a world where the girls go to spankwire too, and they expect their guys to look like the dudes on the videos and have no body hair down there.  Since I don't want to pay to get my pal waxed, this product will have to do.  Hopefully Norelco loses a ton of money on the returns that way they create a more durable version of the product.\n\n+ It works, it really does\n+ The comb attachments make for a good blade protector for travel\n- Breaks really fast\n\nP.S. And hey, if anyone here owned a bodygroomer for multiple years.  Leave a comment, how do I get this thing to last a decent amount of time?", "label": 2}

Suddenly, the blades you have been using for years are duller and don't hold their edge as well.  You move up to the newer shaving system to get back to the old comfort level, at a higher price.  Then, the cycle eventually repeats itself.

The objective was to replace my 6+ year old Remington, which does an ok job but is kind of harsh on my skin.\n\nAfter thoroughly charging my new Norelco, I anxiously looked forward to a close, comfortable shave.  My first observation was that the razor was very quiet -- to the point that I had to wonder whether it was working properly.  When I put it to my face and the sound didn't change, I figured all was ok.  After spending nearly twice the amount of time with the Norelco as I did with my old Remington, I settled for the fact that five o'clock shadow was about the best this puppy was going to do -- for me.  This was disappointing as my sole reason for using an electric razor is to save time.  All I want is one that provides a truly close shave -- comfortably, and within a reasonable period of time.  To that end, this razor does not perform.\n\nI've now owned the razor for about 8 months and use it only on the rare occasion that I need an afternoon touch-up.

For example I find myself shaving quickly before my wife comes home.  Never did that before.  :-)\n\n4. The ergonomics are good.  Good fit in my hand. Good balance. Easy glide over face, neck, chin.\n\n5. I hav oily skin and find I get a better shave before washing my face rather than afterwards.\n\nConclusion:  I like the thing and decided to keep it, but I will be darned if I know why.  Oh, and I just truned 67 and haven't had an electric razor since the 60's.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I shuddered after reading the glowing reviews of this overpriced razor. A new razor is like a new car...what man doesn't love it? The real test comes years later, when problems occur. As a Norelco user most of my life, I sprung for this gimmick. The initial shaves were incredible, but I remained skeptical. After the initial 2 1/2 hour charge, it ran and ran. In fact, the LED readout was inaccurate, as it merrily hummed away, long after it displayed zero minutes available. The nine setting dial is a true joke. What were they thinking here? Some intricate scientific approach to shaving? Any man just wants the closest shave possible, so I dialed it up to the max. After usage when the blades wear, every man will end up doing this anyway. Like any electric razor, it is only as good as the blades. The LED gimmicks on this soon grew old. I just wanted it to fire up and annihilate my whiskers. After two charges, the shaves got worse and I had to finish with a disposable razor to scrape away the missed stubble. The replacement blades are overpriced to coordinate with this \"exclusive James Bond\" razor. Norelco is laughing it's way to the bank, as men buy into this gimmick. I'm going back to a basic electric razor and buying several sets of replacement heads. That is the key to economical close shaves.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This shaver is a bit of a disappointment.  Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a really GREAT shaver.  I give it three stars for \"mediocre.\" It's just OK, definitely not great.\n\nCharging:  At a full charge, it will get me through ONE shave.  But the motor starts slowing down before I finish.  I've had other shavers that would get me through three shaves so I could leave my charger at home for short weekend trips.  I won't be able to do that with this shaver.  I can't even use the trimmer on the same charge as shaving.  The bigggest disappointment is the EXTREMELY short duration of motor run time per full charge.\n\nShaving:  It takes a LONG time to shave your face with this thing.  Combined with the short motor run time per charge, that's a real issue.  If you have a lot of time and you really enjoy shaving, I guess you might not mind how long it takes.  I'm usually in a hurry.  It takes approximately 50% longer to shave my face with this shaver than it did with my old Braun.\n\nThe gel dispenser is kind of a novelty item.  I usually pump the gel out onto my fingertips and spread it on my face that way because it's too time consuming and uncomfortable to spread it with the shaver.  When I use up the gel that came with it, I'll probably just use something else after that.  Don't buy it based on the gel pump.  It's no biggie.\n\nThe pros of this thing are a very COMFORTABLE and QUIET shave, albeit time consuming.\n\nQuality of Shave:  The closeness of the shave is AS GOOD any electric shaver I've owned, but not appreciably any BETTER.  Definitely not as close as a blade, but hopefully no one is THAT naive!\n\nTrimmer:  The trimmer angle is good.  Actually, I like the trimmer other than the fact that I can't trim on the same charge as shaving.\n\nI'll probably keep using this thing since I've already bought it.  But if I had it to do over again, I'd choose something else.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I usually don't buy into hype, but I've been hearing about this blush for almost fifteen years - that's about since I was in high school - and I was always curious about the blush with the risque name. Back then I obviously couldn't afford 30 dollars for a blush, but I finally after all of this time I decided that I would buy this because it was purported to be the absolute must-have universal shade.\n\nWell, I'll start off by saying that the color is very beautiful. I will give it that - especially since it looks super intimidating in the pan because it looks so vibrant. But, honestly, this really is over-hyped and over-priced. Not only is this color not terribly unique, but the wear on this is quite disappointing.\n\nFirst of all, I can't see this flattering all skin-tones as the company claims. Now, I happen to have light golden skin and this does flatter me beautifully. However, the golden shimmer in this is the real highlighter (literally). If you have medium-dark to dark skin, that's all you're going to see - the shimmer. If that's the look you're going for - fine. But then you're better off just buying a regular highlighter, for that matter - perhaps something cheaper, at that.\n\nThe other issue I mentioned before was the wear. Up until recently I never really considered myself to have oily skin, but for the last couple of years I've been using very potent acne medication and it dries my skin terribly and, as a result, I suspect it sends the oil in my skin into overdrive - I mean, it comes back with a vengeance. In any case, maybe this just doesn't seem to last long on me because the makeup I wear makes my skin oily. Or maybe I'm just not putting enough on (I don't like have to pile on blush. I give my brush five swirls. For some colors and brands, that could be overkill - but this one is just that light. Either way, anything after five is overkill for me regardless.). Whatever the case, this blush is pretty expensive for it to be fading on me as quick as it does. I mean after four hours, it's barely there. There's the shimmery residue but the color is adios.\n\nMy consensus is that the name clearly gave this blush its cult status. On its own, its just nothing special. I've seen so many make-up dupes for this shade (and for cheaper) that it really makes you wonder if this one is just really worth it. Wet n Wild blushes are more vibrant and - on me, at least - they last all day.\n\nSo would I recommend against buying this? No, not if you're just curious like I was when I bought it or if you already wear this brand. This was my first buy from Nars. I prefer Bobbi Brown, Urban Decay, and M.A.C (no surprise there, right?) for my make-up. But like I said, I just wanted to finally try this. So, I did and it's just okay.", "label": 2}

{"text": "There's acetone in this thinner. If you do a little research (or think about what acetone is used for...removing polish) you'll understand that this is temporarily making the polish thinner by breaking it down. It's just like when you take your polish off your nails, it becomes thinner and wipes away. With the exception of maybe the alcohol, none of the ingredients are typically found in nail polish. Other brands are a mix of the ingredients that make up nail polish that are mostly likely to evaporate. They thin the polish by replacing the lost ingredients. This thins the polish by breaking it down.\n\nI used it in a polish that I'd used a different thinner in before. With the different thinner, the polish performed like new. With this thinner, the polish became patchy. I couldn't go over polish I'd already put down because it would pull up whole patches if I tried to run the brush over it.\n\nLuckily, I purchased mine at a store with a great return policy so I can get my money back. When looking for thinners, stick to brands that have butyl acetate and ethyl acetate.", "label": 0}

Of course, Norelco is going to warn against using any other type of solution for my model, and of course I'm going to be a sucker and continue to use just the HQ200 solution, like a lamb to a slaughter. But for this, I don't consider this as a bad thing.\n\nRegarding on-line purchases of this solution - strange, but it has always been my experience that it is cheaper to buy it ala carte, rather than as a pre-priced 6-pack, whose per unit price worked out to be a dollar MORE per bottle.

I noticed that a few reviewers said the same thing.  Because I had only a few rows of bristles left, I ordered another.

The Helen of Troy logo imprinted on the handle is worn off as well (I've only been using this new one since mid-June of 2014!!) which is a CLEAR INDICATION that this item is either bootlegged or a knock-off.  I don't have my packaging anymore so I can't send it back.  However, I left seller feedback so we'll see if they respond.  DON'T PURCHASE THIS STYLE!!

The \"Plus\" in the product's name seems to refer more to the much higher cost of this product.\n\nIf you're thinking about getting this, just realize that all it is is three more strips, so when you figure out how much you're being charged per strip, you may find you're paying considerably more for these poer strip than the regular Whitestrips Premium.\n\nThat being said, the strips are a great product and if you get them, make sure you buy some toothpaste for sensitive teeth because this product WILL make your teeth feel like they're on fire.

{"text": "Dear Mr. Bond,\nAfter trying your new secret shaving weapon, by the name of \"Norelco 8894XL Spectra\", let me report about my short experience with it. First of all, I wonder about the name \"Spectra\". All your fans know, that Roger Moore got rid of Spectra and its vicious leader, Mr. Bluefeld, about 30 years ago. So how come we meet it again today as one of your gadgets? I know. You'll say it's nothing, and you'll probably be right. But the name is a symbol to my main argue, that 8894 is nothing but an old machine pretending to be new.\nIt's a good shaver, but it doesn't give you the right value for price. I have a 10 yrs. old Norelco 5584XL, that offers more or less the same digital functions of 8894's LCD, and does a good work on my face. Of course,  the 8894XL's battery is better, and gives about 30 minutes more of shaving, before recharging it, the designing is more up to date,and you can wash it with water, unlike the older generations. But the 5584XL, looks nice and elegant even today, it's most reliable, and works almost as new. The problem, 007, was, that I tried the 8894XL for few days and did not feel much improvement comparing to the 5584, that can justify spending so much money on it.\n I don't know Braun or Remington last models, but in my opinion, if 8894 is Philips/Norelco's best shot, their shaving machine division has reached its moment of truth.\nSo, Mr. Bond, these are the reasons for not buying your shaving weapon: it looks new, it costs new, but it doesn't work as new.\nP.S. If you think about selling your old silver Aston Martin by the price of your shaving machine, please let me know.", "label": 0}

{"text": "THEN: I used Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture cream for over 10 years.  It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level. The original cream was a lovely and rich (without being heavy) cream that gave my skin a remarkable and noticeable glow often commented on by others.  Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry. Due to our extremely dry climate I would use approximately two 2 oz. containers a month. When I traveled to hot and tropical climates the amazing effect was an actual lessening of oiliness.  I am at times prone to breakouts and this product never caused any.  I would keep some in my purse to apply under my eyes once or twice during the day, and the effect was always a brightening lift of any appearance of fatigue, youth in a jar. No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable.  It was a quick to soak in, frothy souffle of intense moisture but with a feather light feel on the skin.  I run out of adjectives trying to describe how perfect this cream was.  I never broke out and my face felt and looked dewy and glowing.\n\nNOW:  The name and formula have both changed.  If you purchase from this page you will be receiving \"Lavender Luminosity\" night cream instead.  When I went to make a recent online purchase I saw more than one review of the product stating that if you had previously enjoyed this product to now beware.  The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \"more sustainable\"  formula.  I note the company does not say what becomes \"more sustainable\".  I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.\n\nI finally found a store I could test the new formula.  I left without making a purchase because I found both the daily moisturizer and the night moisturizer, completely different products from their former selves.  If this were an improvement I would have undoubtedly purchased in bulk.  I am afraid I find both new products extremely, in a word, horrible. And it would be a gross waste of my money to purchase either one. I will also add he product turned my face dangerously red and stung like an angry hornet. A unique an unpleasant sensation no other product before or after has managed to produce.\n\nUnbeknownst to me my mother did purchase both the daily moisturizer and the Ultimate Moisture night cream (based on my rave reviews to her of the previous formula), which she gave me (since she didn't like it anyway).  Braving a potentially hostile skin reaction, I wore the daily moisturizer for two days, and each day it felt like such a relief to wash my face.  It leaves a completely unnatural \"mask\" like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way.  It feels like a layer of plastic saran wrap.\n\nI thought it not possible, but the night cream was even worse.  It reminded me of some margarine I purchased during an extended stay in a third-world country once.  I tried to melt it in a skillet and it never melted, even at very hot temperatures.  It would never spread with any fluidity, nor would it soak in to any food item.\n\nI lament the new night cream feels just as cheap and ineffectually formulated as third-world margarine.\n\n I have never written to a company to express my disappointment until now.  I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \"improved\" product. They have chosen not to reply or acknowledge my letter.\n\nSo, it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else.  I am currently trying a bevy of products one after the other in my quest.  None are as perfect as the one solitary jar I have left of the  original formula \"Ultimate Moisture Cream\".  Good title that one, \"ultimate\" is absolutely right.\n\nIf you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I tried this as an alternative to organic henndigo and now Surya Henna cream.  Henndigo, as well as Surya Henna cream (in the dark brown shade I chose) was darkening the base color of my hair while leaving burgundy highlights in my 20ish% grays.  My intent by using this was to lighten my hair to its original shade of ash brown with light chestnut highlights.  It looks black from a distance so it's kind of hard to explain, but it would get natural golden copper red chestnut highlights in the summer and biscuity on the ends.\n\nThis product smells awful and made my head hurt.  It smells liquoricey but with a stinky rotten egg smell similar to perm solution, tossed with a dash of burnt hair.  Being the organic type of gal I've never had a perm but remember the stench well from going into salons and smelling my sister's hair after she had one.  The towel is still on my head after the ordeal.\n\nThe 4n lightened up my blackened hair a wee bit but with a blue green undertone.  I am not blaming the TfN for this--I know I had used other colors (Surya dark brown) that probably, no, surely, contributed to this.  And of course I never strand test.  I am opposed to strand testing! ;) No one ever does it anyway...  Anyhow I followed the directions to a T and my hair came out dull and lifeless.  Ick.  Also with the aforementioned blue green gray cast.\n\nSo I applied 5D Golden brown after that.  It's such an ordeal.  I left on the conditioner afterwards for 5 minutes then washed and conditioned again (with a better, organic conditioner)  for a total of 3 times and left them on each for 5 min.  Let's see how the color comes out--probably fine but feels lifeless and has an awful lingering damage smell.  I will have to condition the heck out of it and probably apply real henna again to get the luster back. (a 2-day ordeal...)\n\nI am going back to Surya Henna Cream, but this time in light brown or ash blond to cover the grays with something not too red but give some highlights at the same time.  Next time if I want to lighten my hair after continual gray coverage (have to redo about once in 10 days due to fast growth and stark contrast between gray and dark) I will spray on some good ol' sun in, then cover it with Surya henna in some lovely bright shade to give my natural highlights back.  Or, (I read this somewhere online this evening) I will try peroxide mixed with baking soda and conditioner, then leave on till lightened to the desired shade.  Peroxide damages slightly but it's certainly not a carcinogen.  No more icky PPD for me!", "label": 0}

Before applying the red clay I did have three red pimple, which have reduced in size significantly.\n\nBefore I've purchased this item, I did read most of the reviews.  Many people complained about removing the mask and it staining their skin. I found it to be rather simple to remove.  I had simply filled my sink with warm tap water then washed my face.

{"text": "There is nothing wrong with the shaving system here--it shaves well, although you must move it more slowly across your beard, the shave is much quicker when you do.  It's in the flashy electronics that Norelco has done another reverse-turn. Old Norelcos would \"beep\" for a few seconds and also show a blinking \"time to clean\" symbol until you opened the head (presumably do to so). Then the \"beep\" was removed in a later model and the cleaning indication on the screen only stayed lit for a minute or so--if you didn't look at the screen, too bad. Now for this latest \"improvement\"(!), the cleaning indicator blinks after EVERY shave regardless if it needs cleaning or not. The instruction manual says on page 13 says it will blink \"about once a week\" and on page 22 that will blink \"after each shave\". Believe page 22! If I have to clean out the head after every shave, shake it in a towel and let it air-dry on the counter-top, then I might as well go back to a blade & foam--it's about as much mess and trouble! The count-down \"minutes left\" feature has the annoying habit of starting a rapid decent when you switch off the shaver from 20 minutes or so remaining, suddenly to single digits--which again makes you have to physically look at the screen's slowly appearing symbols after every shave. A row of \"pixels\" that form the numbers on the screen were not working to begin with making it a bit tricky to read some of the numbers (annoying, but not enough to send it back!). Norelco's attempt to keep you purchasing their cleaning solution is a marketing-ploy. If you wash it out with warm water occasionally as instructed, you should only have to use the solution cleaning system when you re-charge it. The charger/cleaner base also has to be un-plugged when not in use & there's no provision for cord-storage.\n\nA whole series of easily-fixed annoying \"niggles\" that make it much less than satisfactory (and I'm not even going to mention the lurid orange trim on the otherwise sleek stainless steel colored body shape!).

When you look up the list,  you get a physical address in Texas with no phone number or email. There is also an online support chat that appears to be unmanned at all times.  Bottomline,  the Panasonic warranty is a hoax - non-existent.\nI opened up the shaver to look inside to see if it was something easily fixed. It is fairly easy to open. I found that water had leaked into the unit and the motor was rusted in parts.  Nothing else was amiss.  Cleaning up the rust did not revive the unit. I had always used it dry and the only water contact was for gingerly washing the blade end of the shaver with soap and water while keeping rest of the unit dry. Surely the manufacturer doesn't expect a bikini shaver to be used without washing or cleaning at any point!\nSave your money and buy the ES2207p. It is a bit more expensive and bulky but works till the blades become blunt.  I had one that is still working after about 5 years except the blades are too blunt to get the job done.

{"text": "I chose the Helen of Troy 1 inch barrel curling brush iron because IT IS THE ONLY ONE MADE AT THIS TIME!!!  I have used this product from other manufactures for many years but no one else is currently making one with these spec's.  My criticism of your product is: 1) the tip is suppose to stay cool, it does not. It gets hot.  2) the tip and the handle are attached to the barrel without a collar to keep hair from getting caught in the crack produced by the attached pieces.  I have engineered my own \"collar\"  so as not to have my hair pulled out by the roots when it gets caught in the crack.  3)  the heat temp control is on the handle and easily \"bumped\" to change temp's.  4) the power doe NOT go off after an amount of time; it will stay on until turned off and if forgotten, it could be dangerous. These are all issues that were resolved by products purchased in the past but your product has failed to meet these standards.  I am very disappointed that this is the ONLY product with the spec's I need currently being made but I sincerely hope you can modify your design to better accommodate to these criticisms.

For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative.  A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don't stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.

{"text": "Unfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems.  It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I've tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don't recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades.  Here are a few other points:\n\n1)  For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.\n\n2)  I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor?  With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.\n\n3)  Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \"fins\" or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \"prep\" your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin.  Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.\n\n4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor.  My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn!  I can shave everyday now.  I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \"classic shaving\" to find them for cheaper.  The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people.  Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have mixed feelings for this product. I got it way back in 2006, wanting to get rid of my hairy, ahem, bottom.\n\nThe first use was a bit of a disaster since I didn't read the instructions well and didn't understand how to use the different combs and ended up trimming off more than I should have. I went overboard, and ultimately, to even things out, I had to shave off everything (arms, legs) which made me the butt of jokes from my roommates, and their friends (men and women alike).\n\nAnyways, once I learned how to use it properly, I started loving it. I used it on shoulders, back, buttocks, thighs, chest and abs. Couldn't muster the courage to use it on the pubes though, so stuck with a pair of scissors for that.\n\nUsing it is easier, takes less time and painless if you use it more often (say once in 2 weeks). If you restart in a month, it will take longer and shaving longer hair can be a little painful.\n\nWhat's bad?\n1- The foil-cutter piece came out of the head while shaving a few times (partly because I was using it on hair that was too long).\n2- In less than a year, the foil got damaged so I had to buy another foil-cutter piece (about 10 bucks I think).\n3- The power button started behaving weirdly. Sometimes it would stay depressed and cause the thing to not charge. Sometimes, while charging on the stand, it would start automatically, making a buzzing sound in the middle of the night.\n4- In a little over a year, it started losing charge like crazy. Every grooming session, I would need to keep re-charging, making a 15-minute process a 1.5 hour process.\n\nIn short, I was disappointed in the quality, but liked the functionality. Re-investing in the same product seemed stupid, but I was hooked to the idea of shaving everywhere.\n\nSo, upon reading more reviews, I got the new model, BG2030&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Philips-Norelco-BG2030-Professional-BodyGrooming-System/dp/B001E0C9LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System</a>&nbsp;. It cost only  a little more, but has been great so far. BG2030 is all black, is much sleeker, and has separate interchangeable heads (not just separate combs) for shaving vs. trimming. It includes two size-adjustable combs - one for longer hair and one for sensitive areas. Finally, with 2030, I was able to muster the courage to use it on pubes, and it works very well. Oh, and the power button is redesigned too, so it doesn't depress and switch on on it's own anymore.\n\nSo skip this older model, and get the BG2030 instead.", "label": 2}

Everyone talks about the cleaning stand which I also agree is very neat and does a good job of cleaning the razor, but the problem is neck hair. If you look at any of the consumer bulletin boards, you'll see the same complaint over and over. This thing simply doesn't trim long hair that runs flat at the neck line (or for that matter any long hairs). You must use the beard trimmer to get these and that really doesn't work well either. The other minor complaint is that this that this thing is VERY loud. Shaving around the sideburn area close to your ear is just uncomfortable because the razor is so loud (not to mention waking up your wife early in the morning).

Open the shaver up and try and clean it the best you can first. Your shaver probably came with a little brush. Use that to get all the bigger pieces out first\n2. When your cartridge is really gross and the indicator says it needs to be replaced, dump out all the solution. The cartridge doesn't allow you to get it completely empty, but do your best.

The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.  Since both of these items are very popular, this stand is a nice complement to both items.  The only down side to the stand I see is if you drip water on it, it will get water spots but it can easily be cleaned.", "label": 1}

What I mean by this is, you will get a much closer shave by using a manual (facial) razor and shaving cream/gel.\n\nIt does feel sturdy, however the head can be a little large for getting certain areas.

You will not get a quick, easy once-over trim with this.\n\nBy the way, the third party prices for this of $80, at the moment, are JACKED UP! I paid $20 or 25 for this when I bought it from Amazon.

After contacting customer service (via email, since I couldn't find a number to talk to a real person) all I got was that this problem was larger than they thought (I'll say) and that I need to return the item for a refund.

It's a shame there's no \"spare\" strips included, because you're likely to waste a couple.  The lower strips especially are prone to getting crumpled up and ruined while trying to stick the damn thing to your teeth.\n\n-The gel tastes terrible.  I recommend brushing your teeth shortly after you remove them.\n\n-You can't really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they're on your teeth- even swallowing is difficult at first.\n\n-The packaging does not stress that you need to use them TWICE A DAY.  I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.\n\nBut, like I said, my teeth look quite a bit better, although this isn't a substitute for brushing.", "label": 2}

Holds double-edge safety razors with no problem, and will hold single-edge if you point the blade inward (at least with the GEM's I have).  the ONLY criticism i have of this product is that the brush holder could be a little wider.  some brushes just won't fit.  The Semogue Owners club is a prime example - the knot will fit, but when wet, the knot is being pressed rather hard against the sides of the holder, which in my mind could damage the bristles.
