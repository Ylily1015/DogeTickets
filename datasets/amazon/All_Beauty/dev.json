The settings, oh God the settings... the whole point of trimming your beard is to give it that clean, uniform look. If you're looking to get that \"oh I haven't shaved in a few days aren't I chic look,\" this is your machine. If not, and you actually have a beard (and a thick one at that), the trimmer demands that you use a lot of force to attain an even cut; however, if you apply this force, the settings slide--and always down a notch.\n\n4. The settings also react to the least bit of hand contact, so one has to be sure not to ever grab the machine too high up... but then even with this cautionary action, its likely to slip as described in tyrannous trimmer complaint #3.\n\n5. Since you're looking over these reviews, trying to decide \"is this for me and oh, is this for me?\" I'd hasard a guess that you do indeed wish your face to look nice and the hair on it to appear well kept.

Unfortunately the sculpting function does no better than setting 2.\n\nThere you have it. Instead of plopping down the money for gadgetry that fails everytime, go for the simpler model, the smaller one, the one with the stategically placed setting switch, that one that makes your sink look like its just seen a balding rat climb out of the drain and shake all its loose hair hither and thither--God knows you're gonna have to clean it anyhow.

{"text": "I've used Norelcos for over 30 years. This latest version comes from China, with questionable implications as to quality and conditions of manufacture.\n  Extremely light and quiet, it feels more like a woman's shaver. Therefore, it may not be suitable for men with heavy beards who are not accustomed to electric razors.\n  Older Norelcos were solid, well made and came with solid cases; this model has no case at all, making careful handling essential. Considering this shaver's apparent fragility, if you ever drop it you'll need a new one. Norelco switches have always been erratic, so leave the switch turned on and unplug the shaver to turn it off.\n  For the moment it does a good enough job, even without a closeness control. Its best feature is a full-sized trimmer, which works well.\n  If today's lower quality standards for small appliances don't bother you, you may find this shaver perfectly acceptable but it is not built to last as long as its predecessors.\nUPDATE (11/07) - Well, this fragile shaver is still going strong - of course, I've managed not to drop it! No complaints,  and the price has gone down a third since I bought it. Definitely the best shaver one can get at this price.\nUPDATE (1/13) - Unfortunately I left the original shaver behind at an hotel and sorely missed it until I found a new, unused one on the internet.

If the manufacturer had increased the inner diameter of the brush holder by 1/8\" this issue would have been solved.  It is possible in most cases to slide the brush into the stand where the bristles meet the handle but this leaves the brush unbalanced and easy to knock off the stand.

{"text": "This is a terrible product!! This does not get hot enough!! Bristles are too short and they are flexible....so they don't wrap around the hair very well. If it heated up to a higher temperature maybe I could deal with the bristles. The tip is the only part that gets hot.....too hot to touch. Your hair gets caught in between a gap at the end of the barrel and the handle and rips your hair out. Also, the placement of the On/Off switch is terrible because as you are trying to curl your hair it keeps switching to Off. It is all around a bad product. The only thing it kind of works on is to turn under the ends of my 2 year old's baby fine hair.........even then it doesn't hold the curl very well. Still not hot enough. I don't know why I even decided to give this a try because I own 2 other Helen of Troy products and I don't care for them either. Go with the Conair Instant Heat 1.25 inch with the 25 settings. It gets really hot.........I just wish the barrel was bigger. I don't understand why these are so hard to find???", "label": 0}

{"text": "I got this shaver in early January of 2007.  For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).\n\nOver the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).\n\nI kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.\n\nIn short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming.  The settings match up well with those from earlier units and, once set, there is no slippage from one setting to another.  In my estimation, the \"turbo\" feature adds no functionality, only noise and increased battery drain.  The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed.  A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life.  And as with the last trimmer I owned, the NiCad battery is not replaceable, but it should be.  The battery is the size of a standard AA but it is soldered in place.  Directions are given as to how to remove the battery prior to disposal, but Norelco could have gone the final step and made the battery replaceable.

This one doesn't.  None of my older Norelco's ever slipped from their length setting.  This one does, and when it does, it makes me look like I have mowed my face with a weedeater.  Furthermore, the self adjusting comb never allows my mustache to come out right.  There are always longer hairs towards the top of the mustache that I have to carefully try to cut by taking the brush off.\n\nIn addition, I have followed the instructions very carefully and made sure not to over or undercharge the battery, but innevitably towards the end of my trim, the blades get a little sluggish.\n\nThis is not a model to buy.

That means you've got this small trimmer head that you have to keep in the medicine cabinet or when you travel in a safe place where you won't lose it; the depth indicator is hard to read and the numbers aren't always centered in the tiny viewing window.  Philips has now replaced the old standard coiled power cords with specialized adapters.

Unfortunately this also means that you don't get a particularly close shave either!  Second, the three shaving heads still can't get into those 'hard to reach areas', a problem I've always had when using this brand.  Third, I don't think it's designed for people who have whiskers `off the face' (like on the neck) as the shaver always seem to pull these out, rather than shave them!\n\nIn the end the difference is this: if you have a tough beard, particularly with little 'hard to reach areas' then don't go for this brand - I'd say go for a Braun!  On the other hand, if you have a light beard then this would be a great shaver; it's certainly easy to clean (just rinse under water after each shave) and very light weight.", "label": 2}

I used it in the shower once or twice, with so-so results as far as cutting hair consistently. With the attachments, longer hair gets caught between the razor and the comb and has to be brushed out every few minutes, which was pretty annoying. It also tended to pull with the combs on, which was not cool. When it finally gave up the ghost, its death was because the razor screen tore. Not sure what it caught on or how it happened, but once the screen ripped, the jagged metal edge stuck out so I had to stop using it and never bothered to get a new screen.

{"text": "I bought this razor a month ago, because I thought I could save time with a fast, electric shave. It has always been a pain for me to wake up every morning a couple of minutes earlier just so that I could soak my face in hot water to get a closer shave. After arriving to work late a couple of times, due to the long process of soaking/shaving in the morning, I thought it was time for an electric. I used my friend's Braun razor on which he spent 50 bucks, but I found the closeness of Braun to be around 80 percent to that of a blade. So I was thinking by spending 150 bucks on Norelco's top-of-the-line razor, that I would have a nice quick & easy shave in the morning comparable to my blade. Boy was I wrong!\nNorelco states in their manuals that you should use their shavers for 21 days straight. After a week, I noticed that the skin around my neck started to turn red. My friends would laugh at me because I literally had a \"red-neck\". Then I would use after-shave thinking that would work. But by the second week, my skin was so irritated that it broke out into a rash. I didn't even make the 21 days. I thought to myself, \"was worth it to spend 150 bucks so that my neck could break out into a rash?\" Obviously it wasn't.\nI returned the razor the next day and went back to my blades.

{"text": "I have had my Norelco 5861 XL for more years than I care to remember and it is getting harder and harder to find these replacement blades.  It seems so silly to pay so much for the blades when it seems like you can get a new razor for just a bit more than these replacement blades cost.  HOWEVER, I bought a new Norelco 10 years or so ago (because of the replacement blade cost issue) and immediately returned it - the new one was flimsy, made of cheap plastic, and, in general, felt like it would crumble.  My old razor is built like a tank and works great.  So, to keep using the old razor I love, I need to, unfortunately, buy these very expensive replacement blades every 2 years or so.  The better trade off for me.  File this as more of a negative review of the new Norelco razors, than so much a negative review of these blades other than the cost.

The diameter of the brush hook measures around 1.125in/29mm, which is just slightly smaller than the diameter of My Black Pure Shaving Brush from The Art of Shaving. The prevents it from seating inside the hook making it useless.\n\nThis isn't the fault of the manufacturer, but it would helpful to have the size of the hooks in the product description, so buyers can be assured that their razors and brushes will fit properly.

So far Astra SP is the best. Wilkinson was a close second and I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy again. The value isn't there. It was still a bit rougher than Astra. Others I've tried so far are Van Der Hagen (Germany), which came with my Van Der Hagen razor and Merkur (by Solingen), which came with my Merkur 37c Slant. Van Der Hagen blades are tolerable, Merkur blade was forgettable. I have relegated all of these to \"clearing the runways\" - trimming the sideburns, for which I use the regular DE (not as easy with slant). I have also recently tried Feather and the first shave was rather nice, but the second was rough - I suspect they are a \"one shave blade\", which makes them too expensive and not worth it.\n\nI will probably give them as samples to friends and maybe try it once or twice more in each of my razors and will update if I have any news.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.\n\nI hate this razor!  I used to have a 5814XL that finally died.  It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years.  When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave.  Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:\n\n1.  Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.\n\n2.  I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely.  In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL.  Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom.  I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.\n\n3.  The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.\n\n4.  The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch.  The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose.  This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.\n\n5.  The cord with its huge plug does not coil well.  The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball.  In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug.  This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.\n\n6.  Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body.  This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a \"sexy\" shape.  The shape is also a problem.  The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back.  Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back.  That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.\n\n7.  The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position.  There is not enough friction to maintain that setting.  It constantly wants to move toward the S position.\n\n8.  The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems.  The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough.  Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver.  Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out.  As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up.  However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening.  It did not shave close even before the head popped off.\n\n9.  Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry.  As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly.  That is really dumb!\n\n10.  The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough.  The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.\n\n11.  The storage pouch that provided is hard to use.  It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.\n\nI have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL.  It works really well and I am pleased.  Therefore, please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers.", "label": 0}

This shaver still works well and if you're switching from something else these are the way to go but I'd buy an older, less expensive model as this one is not better than my older version.

{"text": "I bought this stand shortly after changing from canned shaving cream to a beaver brush system to help preserve the brush.  It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\nMy primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.  I took the time to write this because I was impressed with the overall quality which I find to be a rarity these days.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I tried this shaver every day for three weeks.  My biggest problem with it is that to get a close shave across your entire face, it takes between 10 and 15 minutes.  If you shave in the shower, that's a lot of wasted water just standing there shaving.  It literally takes a dozen passes to get all the stubble.\n\nPros:\n* Extremely quiet (almost a whisper)\n\nCons:\n* You can go through the Nivea packs extremely fast.  I was averaging 1 every 4 days.\n* Perhaps my unit was defective, but every time I started to use the shaver, the Nivea pump wouldn't work even after a dozen presses.  I had to flip up the lid to expose the pack, and squeeze it to start the flow, at which point the pump worked. (For those of you who think the Nivea pump is an electronic gadget, think again.  It is a manual pump.)\n* As stated before, it takes FOREVER to get a close shave.\n* Trimmer is a separate attachment\n\nI am returning the Norelco to get my money back.  Just a couple of days ago, I started using the Panasonic ES8077S.\n\nWhile the Panasonic is much louder, it shaved much closer than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  For lather, I simply used a small amount of hand soap.  The Panasonic also has a built-in trimmer.  The Panasonic's gimmick is the cleaning system that comes with it.  While it does a great job of cleaning, keep  in mind that the cleaning and drying process takes over an hour, and it's loud.  The cleaning process could wake your spouse.  Fortunately, you don't NEED to use the cleaner after every use (or at all for that metter).", "label": 0}

Too bad too, because this is such a neat idea!  With just a few tweeks in the design this item could be great but as it is it barely works at all.\n\nCONS:\n* This bag holds next to nothing. All I could manage to carry throughout all compartments was 3 credit cards, 4 bills, a few coins, a chapstick and a small hand sanitizer. All items were packed in EXTREMELY tight and it was hard to get anything in and out. Had they increased the dimensions of the wallet or compartments by just a tiny bit this bag would be much more useful.\n\n* the small snap-closure pocket on the outside of the wallet section allows no room for any objects and bends the area on the interior wallet so that your credit cards bend and warp if you put anything in that pocket (there's only one spot for credit card slots -right on the wall of that compartment! They could have switched the credit card slots to the other side).  I did not over-stuff,  all I had in that pocket was the little chap-stick.  Certainly don't plan on carrying anything with any dimension in this pocket. At most you could fit a black plastic comb or a book-mark.  I don't know if it was because of the chap-stick or because of a miscalculation in sewing - but I couldn't get 1 row of the credit card slots to hold any cards at all- they seemed too narrow.\n\n* The back pocket is lined for phones or sunglasses but the angle of the pouch and the velcro closure made me nervous about putting my touch screen phone in this pouch - it felt like it might pop open and the phone could only fit in without its little case.  (There's no other place in the purse which would accommodate a phone... so unless you have an older, tiny, light weight clam-shell phone or one you don't care about too much -- you're out of luck).  Also this pocket is only gusseted for dimension in two sides --- and flat on the bottom. What's the purpose of this?  Even less fits in and it would have been perfectly easy to make one 3rd \"wall\" to make the pouch bigger. Doing it this way only makes items smashed and difficult to get in or out.\n\n* The WORST design flaw, aside from the small size of all the compartments is that getting the \"tote\" bag BACK into the compartment is very difficult and once unfolded, it never goes all the way flat again adding yet more ungainly bulk to the bag.  If you try to just stuff it back in, forget it.  You must fold the bag in exactly the way it came out... a feat that requires a little patience.  If you're bad at folding maps- just forget it.\n\n* The two straps for carrying on your shoulder or around your waist  are very thin and located on either side of the main zippered area which makes it awkward to get into the wallet area.\n\n* The bag is made of a stiff canvas material and is therefore not very light-weight.\n\nPROS:\n\n*When unfolded, the tote bag is much more useful and seems VERY sturdy and roomy.  -- You could use it just as a tote bag and never fold it back up with the wallet and sunglasses pouches still accessible on the exterior for trips to the beach I suppose - ...though there are more fashionable plain old totes for that purpose.\n\n* Someone who carries only a card and some bills or coins and sunglasses to the farmers market or on garage sale trips might find this little bag quite useful.\nFor that reason, I marked it as a \"3\" instead of a 2 star - which it more deserves.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have extremely dry skin; in particular, my hands. I've used Eucerin for years. However, the effectiveness of the product has changed recently. Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This stand rocks! It makes our bathroom look clean and sheek. Bought this as a gift to my spouse and he loves it. It displays his fancy razor and shaving brush. It has a steardy bottom and is heavier than I though it would be, giving it the ability to remain upright if accidentally get bumped or brushed in the morning.  Highly recommended!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I didn't receive the product listed by the label or the picture. I received an anti-wrinkle cream that did not include the retinal palmitate cream. It just states it is cream hydratante. It does not allow me to return it for a refund or exchange. Feel misled by advertising and I am not happy.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I have been using it for over two weeks now once a day and have noticed a lightening in the area affected on my legs (strawberry legs) but wanted to know if moisturizing afterwards was okay.  I tried to contact skindoctors but haven't gotten a response. If anyone knows of a 800 number to reach them that would be great. I have ordered my second bottle and hope this time it totally changes the appearance.", "label": 2}
