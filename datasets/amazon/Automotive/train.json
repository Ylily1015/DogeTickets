{"text": "Bought this since my car is over 120,000 miles and I want to start doing more of my own stuff.  120,000 mile service was going to be a pretty penney at the dealer, and although I have done my own oil changes on this car, and more involved work on other cars, I hadn't really done anything serious on this car.  And when I did work on other cars, I always bought the factory service manual to help me a long as I am not a mechanic; but with proper instructions, I can do pretty much any of it.  On the Prius however, the factory service manual was silly expensive and three volums.\nThis book really lacks in detail, and occassionally seems to miss steps completedly.  And it is clear that a substantial part of the book is simply cut and pasted from their other car manuals.  I hate when they say \"tighten to torgue listed at the front of this chapter/book\" why not just put it here on the page I am looking at?  Except to save money by makig the books faster and cheaper to write.  Just annoying.  Would it really cost you that much more to do it properly and put the spec in both places?\nI think more and better/larger pictures would help.  Sometimes they show where the part is located by taking a pic and pointing an arrow at the part, which is great, except the pic is so small you can't tell where in the engine bay it was taken.  Especially since none of the pics are in color.  Also, and this might seem like nit-picking but the paper used int he book is the cheapest thinest paper you can buy.  Sure it saves money, but it makes it harder to read in anything but direct light, which isn't always what you have when you are working on a car.  It also makes it much more likely that you will tear or otherwise damage the pages when your hands are the least bit oily or dirty -- obviously a common scenario when reading a car repair manual.\nI just got the Bentley publishing one, and although a little more than twice as much $$, it has a lot more info, it is presented clearer and it has better pictures.  It isn't perfect, but a lot better than this one -- a lot.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Researched this cover on Amazon, and due to reviews and sizing information, purchased the U1 size as recommended. Received the cover today, and tried to install it on my Chevrolet Equinox. This particular cover is NOT a good fit for my 2013. When I attempted to wrap the front & rear of the cover completely under the bumpers, the fit was much too tight on the front of the hood, over the rear window wiper arm, and over both rear tail lights. The cover was so tight, that I was concerned not only for the finish of the car, but that it wouldn't be long before the cover tore due to the tightness (and yes, I did fold in the side mirrors prior to installing). Also, one of the plastic grommets used to tie the cover beneath the car was missing from the hole, and 2 pieces were ultimately located, with the retaining ring piece being cracked so that the grommet will not stay in place.\n\nDue to the sizing problem, I checked the specs on the Equinox and found that it is listed as 187.8 inches in length. So ... it would make sense that a cover designed for up to 186 inches shouldn't fit, especially when trying to wrap it fully under the bumpers/air dam. If I were to purchase another Budge cover for this car, which I won't, I would purchase the next size larger, even though many sites recommend the U1.\n\nThe quality of the cover material is very good (better than I had expected), the elastic hem around the bottom of the cover and the grommet areas are well sewn, and except for the broken plastic grommet and the sizing for my car, I would recommend it very highly.\n\nHowever I will now be researching other covers ... fortunately this cover was well enough priced that I am not going to bother to return it ... will probably give it to Goodwill.", "label": 2}

I figured if I can wire up and engine and supply communications to a military base, then a small job such as this would be easy...wrong.\n\nThe first problem I ran into are the wiring diagrams from the website, a majority of the color codes for the online wiring diagrams were correct. However, a few vital elements such as anything having to deal with something other than the starting circuit, had me running in circles and ripping my car to pieces. Secondly the directions included in the kit are straight forward enough, but it wouldn't hurt to have a couple of testing procedures and troubleshooting tips before you start blowing fuses and circuits. Lastly, if you have a early 90's and later vehicle, their T harness option is hard to find. Hope your ready for Easter wire hunting.\n\nIf you are a do-it-yourself kind of person then I suggest paying money to to have this system installed...especially if you own a smaller vehicle such as a sports car where space is limited. There are a lot of extra features that consist of button combination's with system programing. I suggest staying with the basics ( lock/unlock, start/stop, and trunk release), or your going to be forking out extra money and time for vehicle and option specific relays. (provided by bulldog security of course). Not to mention the loads of schematics and diagrams that need to be thumbed through.\n\nOnce the system is in and installed it's solid and works for a large area including buildings.

I got this so that I could wear them when I needed them, whether I was at work or home or school or wherever.  I like the option to have both colors.  I like that there is a gold and silver and then quite a few of the replacement pads for the essential oils.  The clasp is easy to open and close.  I haven't had any issues with the locket opening or anything.  I like that this is a long necklace.  I don't usually wear short necklaces so I was a little worried about the chain length of this product but it turned out I was worried for nothing.  I like the design on the front of the locket.  It is very feminine and pretty.  I also like how the back of the locket is smooth.  Ive ran into issues before where the back of the locket isn't smooth and will snag on my clothing so I appreciate that this one is very smooth and doesnt snag my clothing.

Not unbearable, but I could hear it from a few feet away outside the camper.  It's louder than our rooftop A/C.\n\nThe integrated window clips are good for putting it in front of our van's vent window, which it's wide enough to mostly fill, and it circulates the air nicely.

The guage is a big plus too.\n\nI use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.\n\nWhat I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.

But,  after following the instructions of shaking it and laying it out on newspaper, it still left red fibers all over the car. I would swipe the duster across the dash and any dust was now replaced with hundreds of red fibers which looked worse than the dust. So, I purchased another mini duster (a gray one from Carrand) and I'm much happier with that one.

However, the instructions clearly state that the range is 1.3 to 16 feet. \"We recommend that you never leave less than 1.3 feet between your bumper and the wall.\" This, of course, is kind of ridiculous since if I had 1.3 ft between the front of my car and the front wall, I wouldn't need a parking assist device. When properly parked, my garage allows approximately 4\" of clearance front and rear in total (e.g., 2\" up front, 2\" in rear if centered). Thus, I have .25 ft. The unit simply flashes red about 1.5ft before I get pulled into the proper position and then goes off.\n\nThis may be fine if you have lots of room in your garage and need to park in a very particular position among the piles of stuff, but if you have a particularly tight garage, it may not serve your needs.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This manual has guided me through a number of repairs over the past few years, however it is certainly _not_ a replacement for a factory service manual.  The underlying problem with this manual is that it tries to cover too many different vehicles, and while it attempts to address the nuances of each model, it invariably leaves quite a bit to be desired.\nI have a 1991 Isuzu Rodeo 3.1L V6, a model which is not covered too well. The pictures in the manual don't usually help, since they are irrelevant to my vehicle.  Especially with regard to the engine.  My particular year's engine might as well not exist according to this manual.  Just recently my water pump went out on me, and replacing it was entirely different from that described in this manual.  The picture of the 3.1L engine in the Haynes Manual was not mine!  (this is just one example of when i've been let down).\nThough an experienced DIYer or mechanic will know how to fix most things in his car, this manual was little help aside of general auto repair information.  Indeed, I learned a lot simply by \"flying blind\" into much of my auto repair, making the manual irrelevant.\nThe conclusion: Call Isuzu (Helm publications, I think) and order their service manual, which I haven't done yet, but I plan on doing.

They were all fairly easy with the directions given, except that this book does NOT have a diagram for the serpentine belt, so if you take the belt off to replace anything powered by the drive shaft you had better remember where it goes.  Or search google for it.\nI also found it funny that when I looked up replacing the motor mount it basically said if you're not an expert mechanic, go pay one to fix it, 'cause this isn't easy.

{"text": "This a phenomenal little emergency pen. The build quality is rock solid--it's a little tube of stainless steel. The magnetic cap is plenty strong. I keep it on my key chain, and the pen has never once come loose or fallen off. The magnet is strong enough to give you a very satisfying snap when you insert or remove the pen. Inadvertently detaching the pen is quite unlikely. At under 3 inches long, it fits nicely in my key chain with my car keys. You can use any standard multi-pen refill. I use Fisher Space Pen U1F or U4F universal refills.\n\n----------------------\nEDIT: March 15, 2016\n\nSo this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.\n\nFirst, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3\" to now a bit over 3.25\". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).\n\nSecond, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.\n\nThird, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).\n\nFourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.\n\nFifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).", "label": 1}

{"text": "If you plan to buy this thing, be realistic.  It's $17 from Amazon and $20 from Walmart.  It's solid steel, yes...but the lock is a joke.  You can see that just by looking at it and by putting the key in.  Even without a pick of any kind, thieves can still just cut the steering wheel in additional places until they get it out.  Pull one side out and the other goes, so you really only have to mutilate half of the wheel.  It may require more cuts than the standard Club design though.\n\nKnowing all of this, I still purchased this and use it sometimes.  Just as with locking the doors and engaging the steering wheel lock, it's part of a series of easily erected barriers that are designed to deter casual idiots and delay the serious professionals.\n\nAs always, the best security strategy is a layered one.  A solid car alarm, a tracking service like Lojack, a kill switch, etc are other parts of the equation that should also be considered.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought this because it is cheap and I was going to take the circuit board out of it for a project. I took the casing apart to check it before using it, and found one of the negative (0V) black wire was detatched from board. The other negative (black) wire was soldered over the positive (red)part of the circuit board.  I resoldered all three wires so that they didn't come close to the circuit board.\n\nI also found the plastic had been melted by a soldering iron during assembly - probably an indication of the speed of assembly and low quality soldering.\n\nAlso,the metal side plates (0v) could easily make contact with the center spring (+V)as the plastic was melted away.  I put a piece of plastic insulation between them to prevent a short circuit.\n\nHaving done this preventative maintenance I now feel that the converter will function well as intended. I actually decided to use it as a plug-in converter in the end.\n\nSo, good value if you check for bad wiring, and correct any problems before use, but possibly a high risk of overheating due to a short circuit if you don't check it.", "label": 2}

Also the slim shape is nice to wedge between your desk and the wall without taking up much room.  Then one day a co-worker was walking by my office and asked if I could smell something burning.  I agreed, then went into my office and immediately checked the koolatron.  As I got my face close to the back of the unit, I could feel some intense heat coming off, and I noticed that the fan had quit working and the smell in the office hallway was the heat exchanger burning some of the surrounding plastic.  I'm just glad that I was present to unplug the unit before it burst into flames.  I used to leave the cooler plugged in when I went home at night so I could have a cold soda in the morning (it takes about 4 hours to cool drinks if you just plug it in first thing in the morning).  If the fan had gone out at night this could have been a big problem for me (and my company).  This product should have an automatic shutoff if the fan is not spinning for safety purposes.\nI would not recommend this product for office use as I described above or long periods of un-supervised use.

{"text": "I'm relatively new to polishing so it may just be user error, but I'll tell you my story and let you decide. I started polishing the hood of my car using Meguiar's Ultimate compound to remove some oxidation on speed setting 6. It worked great so I moved to the roof. As I was polishing the roof, I started noticing little specks of white foam on the areas I had just finished polishing. When I checked the pad, I noticed the black plastic backing was cutting into the top of the pad causing the lower part of the pad to bow. I may have been pushing too hard; but when you look at other polishing pads and backing plates, you'll notice the pad only sticks over the edge of the plate by at most 1/4 of an inch. To me, the inch or so extra on the porter cable pad seems like a design flaw. It's still usable but there is no way to put pressure on any part of the pad not directly below the backing plate. This is probably meant to be a waxing pad, so only use light pressure. I wouldn't recommend it as a polishing pad though.", "label": 2}

The brush is curved inwards and while it works fine on the corners, it does not do a good job on flat surfaces.  The brush only hits on the 2 sides of the brush.

You really can't choose what kind of flat you will get, so I can't recommend carrying this kit.\n\nAs an aside, the wrench is no longer included with the kit (it's not listed on the kit package labeling).  The tire levers are EXCELLENT, and they nest together, so I'll be keeping them.  I have a seat bag, and carry an extra tube, and have ordered a patch kit which uses glue.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was surprised to see that this 'muffler' received 4 stars. When I read the reviews, praise was given not because it muffles sound, but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust. Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)\n\nWhen we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.\n\nIt is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on. So in terms of living up to its name, I give it one star.", "label": 0}

With this guide I only spent $35 on the oil and the oil filter and I made dang sure I was using the proper oil and oil filter, not some cheap or recycled crap.\n\nYes you will have to buy tools, but those tools will become an investment and you won't have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get a simple thing fixed.\n\nThis guide is for the self-starters and self-reliant, this guide will teach you just about everything you need to know your CTS.  I love my CTS and with this guide I can make sure I give my precious CTS some TLC.\n\nIf you are a veteran mechanic then you probably won't learn much, but if you have little to no knowledge about your CTS or cars then there's a plethora of useful information you can use.\n\nPros:\n-It's a $20 investment that could save you THOUSANDS of dollars\n-Instructions written in plain English\n-Covers everything you need to know about your CTS, even has electrical wiring diagrams!\n\nCons:\n-Some pictures are dark and kind of hard to see the details", "label": 1}

{"text": "I was interested in a remote start so that I could warm my car up in the wintertime.  I have a 2006 Honda CR-V.\n\nMy husband tried to install this, then he realized that with my car, you need to purchase an additional part (I think it's the T-harness) in order to get around the key security system.  Once that got in, he tried to install but said it wasn't simple enough for him to do it on his own (he's not entirely car saavy, but he can do general things like change oil, etc).  So we took it to a vendor to have the remote installed.  They had to take one of my two keys to put into the engine - so now I have to go and buy another key from the dealership (I was told they run over $100 each for the ones with chips in them).\n\nOnce we got it installed, it has already set us back the cost of the initial kit, the T-Harness, the install and another spare key.  The remote works fine... when it's WARM.  Once the temperature drops below 40 degrees, it no longer worked.  The crank was too short for my car and it wouldn't start.  This defeats the whole point of getting a remote start to warm my car in the wintertime.  Perhaps it would be useful to cool my car in the summertime?\n\nSoooo, my husband took it back to the car vendor to see if they could adjust it.  Well, apparently this kit doesn't allow you to adjust the crank.  So now, if I want a remote start that will work for me, we have to buy a more expensive kit.  *SIGH*.  My husband said that perhaps it might work on his Toyota 4-Runner as he doesn't need much crank to start his car, but he doesn't want to have to pay for another T-Harness to install it in his car and then to have to pay to get it installed.  Not worth it for him - and no guarantees that it would work in the winter!\n\nIt's hard to tell whether the range works well as if I'm in the office and try to remote start, it doesn't start my car anyways (since it's so cold), so I have no idea if it's working.\n\nThe annoying part is just how much work & money that has gone into installing this darn thing and it not even serve the function that I wanted it to.  Based on other reviews I've seen on this brand, perhaps we'll look into another brand for my next install....", "label": 0}

They come with eight different color choices for the felt pad that you put inside of them.  I love that there are so many pads so that I can change the oil smell on each one.  The variety in colors is a nice touch too so you can coordinate with different outfits. The lockets open up easily and the hinge is well hidden in the locket so that you don't really see it when you look at the jewelry head on.  I'm excited to have these aromatherapy diffuser necklaces because diffusing is a great way to therapeutically experience oils for emotional benefits.  Sometime when you put oils on your skin, they soak in so fast that you don't get the aromatherapy benefits for very long.  When an oil is placed on the felt pad inside these necklaces (I just use a couple drops) it lasts for hours!\n\nI did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am happy to give these aromatherapy diffuser necklaces my five star recommendation becasue I would happily purchase these again! If it had been helpful to you please click \"yes\" below.  Thanks!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I did not purchase this rivet tool from Amazon.  I purchased this from Home Depot about two years ago, but I have not popped that many rivets with it.  I bought it for a specific job and that job required a total of 40 rivets, and I've only used it for that job.  I had to do some rework on the parts that came back, so when it was time to button up the chassis, I pulled out this rivet tool to fasten a total of 12 rivets.  I for 10 done and the thread on the nose stripped.  I had to buy another rivet tool to finish the job.\n\nSo, this rivet tool only popped about 50 rivets, TOTAL.  I'm not having the same problem as everyone else.  The threads in the nose stripped so the mandrels won't stay in place so it never gets to grip the rivet at all.  My old rivet tool had installed at least 1000 rivets before I misplaced it.\n\nI give this tool 2-stars, only because it has a nice hammered finish on it, but that means nothing if it doesn't perform what its supposed to do.

I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.\n\nThe suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. It runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. Sample provided for review.", "label": 1}

{"text": "It is a great creeper...BUT\n\nI ordered it from Amazon on 12/7/11 and received it as they said on 12/12/11. No complaints there. I paid $134.99 for a creeper that showed up at my door incomplete. That's not Amazon's fault, that ball Dale Adams Enterprises dropped.\nWhen you buy one (I purchased the rough rider) you will notice when you open box it is quite simple. Basically 6 parts. The \"back bone\", and wrapped in separate cardboard 4 completely assembled casters, and one package of 16 each bolts and nuts. When I started to assemble creeper I got to the last caster, and noticed that they put metal sleeves in the wheel opening where the bolt goes through to bolt wheel to caster assembly. An option that clearly strengthens the whole unit which is good...EXCEPT I received one caster assembly that was missing this metal sleeve rendering my creeper useless. I called Dale Adams Enterprises and explained, in which they profusely apologized and told me they were sending a new caster assembly out immediately today. That is great, except I just spent $134 on a creeper that I cannot use. What bothers me is that there are so few moving parts, and how can something like this be simply overlooked? I bought this because it is very high quality as far as construction of unit, and also because of the fact it is proudly made in the U.S.A. When you get it, you get a little pamphlet that shows all the sub-contractors that are involved with the construction of the creeper along with a little brag about made in U.S.A.... which is also fine with me. But when they show the multi-million dollar facility and Dale Adams showing off his car restoration facilities, I hope they realize that they need to sell a good, complete product or they won't have jobs, or a multi-million dollar facility to brag about Made in U.S.A. for very long. Just frustrated I guess. Dale Adams might think $134.00 is fun money for an hour, but I can't afford to think that.\n**UPDATE**\nI received a new complete wheel/caster assembly from Dale Adams on Thursday 12/15/11 as promised, along with their apologies. Now that I got to take a spin on it...it is the BEST wheeling creeper I have ever owned. I fit good on it (6'5\") and it is made of the best quality. Again, the only bummer was the caster assembly getting shipped incomplete. If it I were shorted nuts or bolts I would have muttered under my breath but then ran to hardware store and that would have fixed that. But to miss such an important piece of creeper in a box with literally 6 pcs. is kinda hard to understand.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I got this cover because I park my 2003 VW Passat in my driveway and it gets dusty pretty fast. Aside from that, leaves from neighbors' trees get in the trim of the windows, doors and windshield. I also see a lot of yellow spots...until now I don't know if it's from tree pollen or bird poop. I would have liked a waterproof cover but the price is outrageous so I settled for this one. During the rainy season I plan to just keep the car uncovered.\n\nI did not know there was a marking on the front end of the cover which says \"Front.\" So after taking it out of the box, lay it out first inside your house to locate the marking. That simple step will make life easier. There's a string included in the bag but I did not even use it because the elastic hem was enough to keep the cover firmly in place. We had a really windy night right after I put the cover on but the next morning the cover was still there.\n\n***UPDATE: 08/15/2013: I really liked how this cover fits on my car but sadly, after only 1 month I began noticing a significant thinning of the material. Eventually, it started shedding powdery lint. The last straw was when it ripped on several spots on the roof area while I was putting it back on the car. I emailed Budge customer service and they were very helpful. I was instructed to send in my invoice along with a cutout of the label/tag. In less than 2 weeks I got the replacement. Sad thing is it will happen again because this cover just can't stand outdoor conditions.", "label": 2}

First of all, you need a mounting location in front of the vehicle at about the same level as the license plate.  The device would not reliably detect the car at other elevations.  When mounted at the level of license plate for the Toyota, at first it would not work.  Then I discovered that the license plate was slightly bent.  I straightened the license plate so it was directly facing the device and it would then work.  Also, you cannot locate anything such as shoe racks or cabinets near the device since they seem to disturb the sound pulses from the device.  I think the device would work better on a SUV or van with a large front grill.  Also the green light is very dim compared to the red and amber light.

{"text": "(This review is for the battery powered model)  In 2001 I bought two Park-Zone PZ-1100 battery powered devices, one for each of my cars.  To this day they work flawlessly.  The batteries last about a year.  In 2008 I bought a new PZ-1100 for my mother, but it didn't work correctly it had all the symptoms described by other reviewers - green light never comes on, yellow and red only occasionally.  So I tried another new one, exact same symptoms.  Then I noticed a visible difference between the new units and my older units.  The current PZ-1100 has two 1/2 inch ultrasonic speakers, whereas my older PZ-1100 had a single one inch speaker.  I also noticed a slight change in the company name; the original single speaker models were made by Measurement Specialties in Fairfield, NJ.  The newer dual-speaker models are made by Measurement LTD, Inc. in Parsippany, NJ.  I suspect there has been an ownership change.  I decided to try and find an older Park-Zone like my original units.  I found several people selling the older version of PZ-1100 which has the single speaker.  You can tell whether it's the old or new by the photo on the box.  Even though the boxes look identical, if you look closely at the picture on the box you can see if the transmitter has one or two speakers.  I recently purchased a single-speaker PZ-1100 and it works great just like my original units. I bought another one from a different seller and it also works great.  I'll give one to my mother and keep the other as a spare.  In case anyone is tempted by the AC powered models, check out their user instructions and you'll discover that if the power fails it will not automatically switch to battery power, so you will lose your settings.  I briefly lose AC power several times a year so for me the battery powered model is actually more reliable.  And no you won't crash into your wall if the batteries go dead, because either you'll see a flashing red light as you enter the garage, or it will be completely dead.  Either way when you don't get that reassuring green light as you enter your garage you'll know you have to park it the old fashioned way this time.  Since that only happens about once a year it's not a big deal. ***Updated 2-21-09*** Another reviewer (Theseus on February 7, 2009) made an excellent point that Park Zone isn't designed to get you within inches of your wall, since the mimimum range is 1.3 feet.  As long as that's not your situation, I find that Park Zone very accurately places my cars in the exact spot every time, giving me the exact clearance that I want at both the front and rear of my cars.  Before Park Zone I was always worried that I hadn't pulled my car far enough into the garage, but with Park Zone I don't even look when I close the automatic garage door, after several years of use it has never put me in the wrong spot.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I am new to essential oils and I was interested in finding new ways to use them. One way that I found that I could use them was in an essential oil diffusing necklace. I love my diffusing necklace because it relaxes me and keeps me peaceful during the day. But the only thing that I do not like about my necklace is that I am not able to change scents out because my necklace only came with three pads. This is why I decided that I needed to get the HOTOR 11 Pics Diffuser Necklace Pads Round Pendant Necklace Refill Pads Reusable-0.886 Inch Diameter. I like the fact that they come in a variety of colors that way I can switch between different outfits plus I can change out scents quickly. So with this pack you get eleven pieces that you can switch out and you can rinse them out and change scents.  I love that you have so many colors and I love that they are thick pads and that they are very good quality ones. I bought these also specifically because this is the same brand that my diffuser necklace is so I knew that the quality would be great. They are extra thick and they do not leak unless you put too much oil on them. I find that they are perfect for my necklace. I have received a discount for my honest review. The opinions and statements are my own and are in no way biased because of said discount", "label": 1}

{"text": "Tried to install this recently. Discovered I would need a 791 bypass for my vehicle. Put everything in and the car will crank but not start. Move the antenna loop around and shazam it starts. Put everything back together and the car will crank but not start again. Went throught this exercise several times. Bottom line when I put the cover on that goes over the steering column the transponder ring is not effective. I can take the cover off and move the ring near the ignition switch key hole and everthing works. Now if I want to leave the cover off this is a great peice of eqiupment. Of course this will not look like junk and therefore I will not do so.\n\nToday I have a vehicle with butchered wiring that will not start with the remote. There is no apparent solution to this problem as tech support is short and unconcerned. I have called and emailed several times. They are quick to talk over you and come off quite cavalier.\n\nBottom line after spending $65 for the unit, $26 for the 791 bypass, $100 for the extra programmed key to go in the 791, the best part of the day installing this thing, and then another day or so troublesooting I would have been much better off spending $200 at Best Buy to have them install one of their units.

They couldn't answer anything about estimated repair cost or the amount of time it would take.  Naturally I needed it fixed soon.  Her response was for me to go online, register on some stupid website to get a repair order, then send it in.\n\nFinally I insisted on talking to a technician.  In 5 seconds he told me not to bother sending it in (that potentially save me a lot of wasted time and money!).  He basically told me that they don't fix them and I'd only end up oweing them $75 for evaluating it.  Even if mine was under warranty they'd substitute it for something else.

{"text": "I truly believe that every car owner should purchase a Haynes manual to go with their car.

It's a very well known thing... check it out), so something which goes into deeper detail is a must. Having all the torque specs, gap settings, bolt types, fluid levels, OEM part numbers, etc., a book like this is essential. As simple as Google is to use, it can be frustrating to try and look up torque specs on a car that is known for having a gang of gnomes seemingly roaming around stealing the manuals, then you go onto a forum, ask what the torque specs are, and the first reply you get is \"Read the manual\"\n\nEven in cases where the manual is there, 99% of what is contained within the pages of the Haynes manual isn't there.

Two stick to the dash, but my dashboard is at an angle and farther away than the air vents, so even though they work, I didn't much like them and had to scrape the taped portion of it off my dash.  I also tried one which clamped to the air vent, but the clamp had to by tightened by awkwardly turning a screw with your hand.  No matter how hard I tightened it, it would fall off within a couple of days, usually while I was trying to put my phone in it or rotate the phone.\nThis mount is a unique approach I've hadn't seen elsewhere, and I  didn't even know it until I got it.  The part that attaches to the vent looks like a clamp in the picture, unfortunately, but it's not.  It's a spring loaded device that completely encircles the air vent once it's attached making it impossible to fall off.  It also only takes a second to attach.  The other part I like about it are the arms that extend from the portion that holds the phone back to your dashboard keeping it from moving out of position.  It's more stable than the other air vent mount I tried.  The mount also has rubber lined grips with arms at the bottom of the base, both of which keep the phone from sliding out of place.  I can't think of any way they could improve it.  Highly recommend!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I used this to mount two 5\" lawn mower tires. The bead breaker worked fine, no problem. Also taking these small tires OFF the rim with the tool was quite easy and fast and the tool worked well. However, putting the new tires on the rim was a challenge until I did two things. The first thing was cut a 1/4 wide groove on the inside side of the tire installing end of the tire tool. This allowed it to ride on the edge of the rim and not slide out. The second thing I did was to change the position of the silver locking \"cone\" when I was installing the tires. I removed the cone, installed one of the plastic spaced on threaded rod so it contacted the tire hub first, then placed the installation tool over the plastic spacer. The cone was then placed on top of the spacer and the locking component was then screwed down tight. What this did was trap the installing tool between the tapered cone and the tire. Between that and the groove I cut into the tool, it made the installation a snap. It would have been impossible to mount a 5\" stiff tubeless tire with the tool without the modification to the tool and using in the manner I described. If it came with a groove already cut in the tool and the instructions would have suggested using it the way I described on the very small tires, I would have given it 5 stars.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Here's a story to tell my grandkids one day.  I plugged it in, and it seemed just a bit tighter than other AC/DC tips, but it worked fine for my cell phone charger, so I left it in.  The next day I came home after work, and my MDX's headlights were flickering like a SOS signal.  What happened was my wife left the lights on, and because the inverter was plugged in and turned on, it bypassed the power-saving mode and the headlights were draining juice from the battery. I immediately went to unplug it and guessed what? IT'S STUCK! I gave it a hard pull, and the stupid plastic tip broke, leaving my battery bleeding out like a stabbing victim.  I ended up cutting the inverter's cord to bypass the antitheft system, then after yelling with my wife for not know to how to use the auto headlight mode, I duct-taped it back so I can salvage my $25.  So now the thing works, but it's stuck in there like a bullet fragment the doctor does not want to touch.  By the way if you're wondering, the car's battery is fine.  Without the anti-theft system, the battery would have been drained completely.  So I have Acura to thank for that.

{"text": "Rated this a 4 for product, 1 for safety =3 overall.  I liked that a product has tons of positive reviews so I bought one to test it out.  I have many wheel chocks, use them only for DIY car repairs.  Don't use them for trailers, RVs, etc.  I usually have a few chocks in my trunk, most are rubber.  This Camco 44412 was a candidate for the trunk as a smaller option and I liked the bright color.  Unlike any rubber chocks you may have used, this seems to slide around a bit due to the hard surface, the plastic.  That's just the difference between rubber and plastic, no big deal. So you'll have to kick it in with your foot to really 'grip' in between the edge of the tire and the cement when you go to use this or it could slide away from the tire.  (This is the same with the plastic ramps, kick them in with your heel to 'seat' it under the ramp first)  Despite the effort of kicking it in to make it wedge in, I'll give the chocks 4 stars as OK and the chocks appear quite solid. You just have to learn how to set them in based on your tire size, the ground,etc.  Now the bothersome part, about safety.  There is a date on the side of the chock that says to not use after this date, and the date was yeaaaars ago.  Even though it seems solid, I don't want to use plastic that is years past it's normal/stable chemical composition in order to hold THOUSANDS of pounds from rolling even the slightest bit, which could lead to rolling on to you.  Plastic can break and crack especially in cold temps, and I don't want any plastic cracking or breaking at all, period.  So for the sake of safety, and the plastic is years \"expired\", and the fact that I work underneath cars I gave that part a 1 star and just threw it in the trash.  (recycle bin, actually,).  It's completely unbelievable that this product is being sold to thousands of people every day.  If you don't care about a little date on the side of the product, then go ahead, it may be just fine for you, but I'll pass.  So my final rating up to 3.  That being said, the next time I see this in a store I'll look at it and if the date is not years past, then i'll buy a couple.", "label": 2}

If you are into the color sets the mood, then match your essential oil with the color.  If you are more concerned with fashion then you will probably find a color within the eight different colors to compliment what you are wearing.\nThe diffuser necklace I have is antique brass in color.  The design is simple yet interesting.  It opens up just like a picture locket. The hinge is on one side and it snaps closed on the other. To change discs, open it up, hold your hand under it, flip it over and the disc falls out.  The discs are a perfect fit so it isn't a problem to change them and they show no other color except the color of the disc.  I only used one drop of the lavender essential oil I have and it lasted two days before the scent begin to fade.  The first time I wore it I used lavender and when I took it off at bedtime I hung it on the bed post at the head of the bed.  I could smell lavender all night. With the ceiling fan running it was just a light scent.  Wonderful!\nWash the discs out with warm soapy water.  With some oils you may need to do it a couple times.  Lavender and peppermint were the two I had to do a second wash and rinse.\nEach time I have worn it I have gotten several compliments.  After a compliment it makes for a good conversation piece.  It is an asset to any wardrobe.  It will go with most anything.  If you wanted you could change the chain. I think most people who are into essential oils will really like this.  If you haven't used essential oils this would be a good way to start.  The price is reasonable, it works with the oils, it is a nice piece of jewelry.  It deserves a 5 star.

I knew what to do with the restorer, but then was a bit confused on which product came next, the polish or the wax.

Either way, it did a good job on my running lights as well as all other parts, but they were the biggest surprise.  They were extremely hazy and cloudy and the restorer made them almost like new. Once I put the wax on them, they looked really good. I was impressed. I'm going to use this product on my car's fenders which are fiberglass as well and see if they get back in shape.

{"text": "I bought the Park-Zone PZ-1500 Platinum Edition parking aid for my wife in early March of 2005 from Amazon.com.\n\nInstallation and initial calibration was quick and easy, and it worked fine for about a couple of weeks. Then it started going nuts with the lights winking in random order. After that, it started flashing red indicating it needs new batteries. So I put a fresh set of batteries in the unit, recalibrated it, and we were good to go until a couple of days ago. That's when it would have a solid yellow light that would stay on for minutes at a time. Now it flashes red, and is telling me it wants fresh batteries. No more batteries for this dud. I was planning on using the AC adapter once I got an electrical outlet installed nearby; but that is a moot point now.\n\nThe Park-Zone receives my \"Just say NO to Chinese made crap!\" seal of disapproval.\n\nIf you want an effective parking aid that will positively park your car in the same place everytime, then (...)They come in yellow or blue. The curb may cost more than the Park-Zone, and the shipping is not free; but the curb works. I have one for my truck and compact tractor, and I just ordered one for my wife's car.

It picked up everything off the carpet and off the floor mats. It has a brush attachment that really works, and a crevice tool attachment that works well in the seat crevices. It also has a hose attachment which works well and appears to be very durable.\n\nThe front stays secured during usage and easily detaches for emptying the dirt out and then is easily re-attachable after emptying.  Everything, including cord and attachments, easily goes into the carrying/storage bag when finished using.  The case is nylon and durable.

I guess the only good thing about it is that I'm not out more than $10 so assume this is why it has a one star rating.\n\nFirst of all the opening is too small and the drain plug catch screen causes oil to splatter.  You will be repositioning this thing from start to finish trying to catch the draining oil.  Once finished you will be cleaning oil off your floor and this drain pan.\n\nIf you seal it up it will constantly leak oil.  I assumed oil wouldn't leak out of the top if it is laying flat, but somehow any oil on top of the seal will find its way out.  You would need to clean any and all oil from the large opening screen area.  Then you will find that the large cap will not screw on correctly.  You wipe the outside clean and a minute later there is more oil leaking out.\n\nNext is the small drain plug.  This thing cannot be tightened.  Like the large cap if you tighten it too much it pops out of the threads, too little and it will not be sealed.  Either way it leaks.  It took me a few days between changing the oil and dumping it at the recycling drum.  Each day I would wipe up the oil from underneath and from the drain pan itself.  Each time had as much or more oil than last.  When I finally took the used oil to the store I dumped this piece of crap in the trash and bought a basic large open pan for $3.\n\nBuy this oil drain pan if you want to witness a product so flawed that it does nothing right for what should be a simple task.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\n\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\n\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\n\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\n\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\n\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\n\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\n\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Save your money on Chilton. They do not hold near the information, clarity and in depth detail, thus VALUE, that Haynes Repair Manuals do. Having said that, I would like to address some complaints I've come across about both Haynes\nand Chilton's Manuals.\n1.) If your manual suggests at a point to seek professional input it is because MOST NON mechanics don't possess the skill or tools or shop equipment to perform a certain procedure (be it correctly or safely). The publishers' lawyer insisted on the \"seek professional input\" so as not to take on legal liability for an unqualified person attempting to perform a critical step in their car care. The reason is valid. You can injure yourself and damage your vehicle as well as render your\nvehicle unsafe to be on the road.\n2.) Prior to purchasing a repair manual, LOOK THROUGH IT. Almost every auto parts store in America sells Haynes and / or Chilton's. If the particular manual you need doesn't have the plastic removed, look for a manual that does and look through the sections. CAUTION most auto supply stores will get mad and make you buy anything you rip open. They're trying to sell information contained in the manual, not give it away. Some copies are USUALLY open and can be looked\n at. Does the manual seem logical, good pictures? Thorough? Then CHANCES ARE that brand will be a good choice for your repair. Also READ the cover front & back thoroughly. It will tell you if special vehicles aren't covered (AWD, Alternate Fuel Vehicles, etc) Know what vehicle you have so you get the RIGHT manual. The correct year, make, model, engine size.\n3.) If you do encounter a problem in the middle of a repair, it's possible that it is YOUR not doing something correctly. Not the tool, or the repair manual. Go away from the car, get lunch or a cold glass of lemonade, read through the manual. Even start again in the morning.\n4.) As automobiles become more sophisticated, there is truly less and less that a vehicle owner can do him or herself. It is a fact, you will need to take your vehicle into a dealership or well equipped shop for more things. In addition, used oil and other fluids are difficult to dispose of. DO NOT THROW DOWN YOUR DRAIN OR BURY IN YOUR BACKYARD!!!. Tires, batteries all have special disposal needs.\n5.) There are some people WHO ARE NOT MECHANICAL. Buy them books, audio / video equipment, ties for Christmas. NOT A WRENCH SET!\n6.) Neither Haynes nor Chilton are Professional Shop Manuals (these are available for hundreds of dollars).\nAs for the particular manual for the Haynes (ASIN: 1563923580) Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country from years 1996 through 1999: This manual does NOT COVER All-Wheel Drive nor Alternative Fuel Models AND SAYS SO ON THE COVERS. Haynes breaks down into different sections each of the engine options (in this example: 4 cylinder,3.0 liter V6, 3.3 liter V6, and 3.8 V6) If you're say, changing an air filter, make sure you're looking at the right directions for the engine for the vehicle you have. The different engines have important items positioned in different locations and thus DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS for each item on each engine. You can even utilize Amazon \"take a look inside\" feature to check out if this manual is for you or not. .I checked it's description for changing wiper blades, oil and oil filters, air filters and general repairs and found it both accurate and easy to understand. I've been happy with Haynes manuals over the years and recommend all vehicle owners purchase one even if you don't expect to do any repair or service yourself. It helps to know the information, to be aware of how your car works and to talk in a reasonably intelligent manner (on your part anyway) when you take your vehicle in for service.\nI'm happy with this purchase. And have been with every Haynes manual I've bought and used in the last 20 years.\nJohn Row", "label": 1}

{"text": "This manual suffers the same problems most consumer car repair manuals suffer from.\n\nIt is not well illustrated: the illustrations are scanty, and sometimes confusing. For example: trying to locate the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve and related solenoids was an exercise in frustration. The illustration shows the EGR valve for a 4-cylinder car, but not one for the V-6 (which I have), except for a view from the bottom of the car. So locating it involved getting under the car, and looking with a light for about 15 minutes -- peering through the gaps in the exhaust system, frame braces, etc. Then, after I identified it, I had to somehow find it again from the top, because it can't be reached from the bottom except by dismantling a frame brace and assorted other stuff. I was finally able to locate it by touch.\n\nLocating and identifying the little solenoid that sends vacuum to the EGR valve proved almost as frustrating. The manual doesn't show where it is located, or what it looks like. There is an illustration purporting to show it, but it doesn't match. I could go on.\n\nTo make this book really useful for the user, it should have well-drawn line drawings supplemented with numerous CLEAR photos showing the part in question in its many versions and forms, from different angles, etc. I'm sure this would make a larger, more expensive book, but it would also make it worth the money.\n\nThe second problem is the lack of sufficient instructions on how to get to or remove parts. The manual will say something like \"remove the whatchamacallit cover.\" It doesn't tell you that to do it you have to remove 7 bolts, three of which are hidden, so that after removing the 4 visible ones you have to grunt and swear and curse until you finally figure out that there are more bolts to take off, AND that you have to slide the cover a certain way to make it come off. It also doesn't say that the whole job would be a lot easier if you take off something else first. I still haven't figured out how to take off the EGR valve without first removing the frame brace, air cleaner, throttle body, and perhaps even the entire intake manifold first -- about NONE of which the manual offers any hint.\n\nThe third problem is that some of the information is just wrong, at least for my car. The manual shows an electrical connector on the EGR valve lift sensor that has 6 terminals. It gives very precise instructions on how to test the sensor by checking resistance between terminals. The only problem is that the sensor on my car has only three terminals. How do I check the resistance on the sensor? I have no clue.\n\nThe previous reviewer's complaints about switching back and forth between different sections to get a job finished are on the mark also.\n\nAll in all, this is a frustrating book to depend on for information on repairs and trouble shooting. However, it is pretty much all that is out there, and it is useful for help in a number of small procedures, most of them not having to do with the engine. You can use it to troubleshoot engine problems, but it takes a lot of patience and a willingness to figure a lot of stuff out on your own, with only broad hints and inadequate illustrations for help.", "label": 0}

Having seen the automobile books, they\n\ndo come in handy for cars built back in the 80's and some in\n\nthe 90's, but increasingly, home repair has become next to\n\nimpossible as cars become electronic gadgets and computerized\n\nin all aspects, and I'm not referring to remote car starters,\n\nor even GPS systems or boomerang anti-theft tracking devices,\n\neither.\n\nSpecifically, in regards to this book, it has a lot of glossy\n\ncolor photos, but only average desktop publishing skills in\n\narranging text, and photos.

The air noise was not that bad. But the total noise was unacceptable (I don't like noisy fans and I may notice them more than you). I agree with other reviewers that the fan does move a lot of air.\n\nSo I returned the fan and since I wasn't sure if it was new decided to give it another try and get a replacement.

{"text": "I purchased two different ultrasonic diffusers and of the two, this one is more attractive. I waited to review it until I had had chances to use it for several days and clean it once. It does require you to have ascorbic acid to clean it, but I actually did, and cleaning was easy. I have been using exclusively distilled water and there was no evidence of mineral build-up, but I can see how cleaning any oil residue would be important,so I intend to clean after every three days of use.  This diffuser runs continuously for the time you set it for, for up to 180 mins (3hrs) it can be left unlit or lit brightly or dimly, and I liked the bright setting for reading prebed stories. It takes no more then 3drops of essential oils and 100 mls of water, so if you want a blend it's best to premix it before adding it to the diffuser. The amount of steam is significant and can permeate the open front end of my house within 15 mins.\n\nPersonally, I don't need a diffuser with lots of colors and am fine with the continuous steam, if you want one that provides short bursts of steam, this is not for you, but for an attractive, simple option, this is a winner.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discount so that i could try it and share my thoughtful and unbiased opinion about it with you.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have had this remote installed and partially working for about 1 month now.  If you are planning on buying this item, I highly recommend checking out the wiring diagrams on the bulldog website before purchasing.  This may show you how hard your install will be or how many more items you need to purchase to make it work. This is located under \"Vehicle Wiring Diagrams\" at [...]\n\nIf you find your car on their and the diagrams don't have special notes or alternate wiring diagrams attached then I suggest buying this and installing it yourself if you are so bold.  I was able to install the starter portion within about 3.5 hours on a Dodge Stratus '98 with no special security bypass requirements.  If you see a lot of additional notes, additional wiring diagrams, and the need for what they call a P791 security bypass, you may want to look into how much additional money you will have to dish out to make this product work.\n\nI'm still having troubles with the parking lights, Horn, and door locks.  The reason I'm having trouble with the parking lights is because the unit that I received does not have a brown wire that I can use for the lights.  The manual references a brown wire that does not exist.  After calling support they stated they had never seen this and I would have to call Customer Service to get another wire harness to fix this.  This is just the first of many questions that the technical support person should have been able to answer.\n\nFor example I asked him if the wires went in order according to the order they are listing in the manual so I could figure which one should be the brown wire.  He stated that they are not, but if fact after double checking they are in order.  It appears that my unit has 2 black ground wires.  Now it's up to me to figure out which one should be the brown light wire.  I also asked about which guide I should reference for the resistors used for the door locks and the answer he gave me was way off base and I would have to be an idiot to not follow the special notes on the wiring diagram which spells out the special resistors for the door locks.\nHope this helps your decision process!\n-Ben", "label": 2}

The plastic tip does not create a good seal on the valve stem and It usually takes me 2 sometimes 3 times to get an accurate reading.  I think this could be avoided if the tip was metal.  Also, there is no bleeder valve, so if you're tires are overinflated, you need to do more work.  I personally use the Accutire MS-4021B which I find far superior and it's way cheaper.  Strangely, it's cheaper but more ergonomic and practical as it has a nice thumb rest to help you get a better reading and it also has a rubber grip.  Personally the best gauge from experience is one of those analog ones that have a built in bleeder and have a filler chuck so you can fill the air through the unit and bleed off whatever you don't need.  Trust me it saves you a lot of time.  But if you insist on one of these digital gauges, I recommend the Accutire MS-4021B.  It's cheap, it works, and it's more practical.

It's not too strong but strong enough to create a fantastic smell all over the house. I highly recommend this product. It has several different features from how long you want this diffuser running 60, 120, 180 minutes and lights on or off. It was so simple to set up, you really don't need to read instructions.

{"text": "I ordered this necklace for my daughter. She sometimes suffers from anxiety and we have found that aromatherapy/essential oils can help her. She carries a roller bottle in her backpack for school that she can usr to apply the essential oils as needed, but I wanted some way for her to utilize the aromatherapy to help her, especially during times she may not be able to access her backpack (like during testing, for example) My sister who sells essential oils recommended I look for a necklace diffuser. I wanted to find something that was pretty and didn't look like anything other than just a piece of jewelry.\n\nFirst I must tell you that this piece is beautiful, the picture does not give it justice. It coms in a vary nice gift box, so if you are giving this as a gift that is something to consider. The different color pads give you options, being able to switch them out to match your outfit or using a color for different scents. My daughter loves the black because it really makes the silver design \"pop\". The length of the chain is on the longer side, which I was not sure my daughter would like, but she has learned that it is long enough to pull up closer to her nose is she feels like she needs the effects of the aromatherapy more, or as she called it \"if I need to take a hit\"....teenagers. The ring on the diffuser is big enough you should be able to switch chains pretty easily if you wanted to. My daughter is considering putting hers on a silk rope because she like that look more and then she could just tie it at her desired length.\n\nChances are if you are searching for something like this you are at least somewhat familiar with the benefits of aromatherapy. This is a beautiful inconspicous way to achieve the results you are looking for. I wish I would have thought of something like this back when I used to work in a hospital, having something nice smelling close to my face would have probably been useful from time to time :) I am considering getting one for myself and my other daughter, we both suffer from  migraine headaches so these might help us also.\n\nAlthough I received this product for reduced/free in exchange for my honest opinion, it is my honest opinion/review of this product.

He loves how he can always lightly smell it but can lift it up and smell it if he is feeling more stressed. (Even his classmates come ask to smell his necklace).

If anyone has a good way to defeat the steering lock I'd like to hear it, the heads of the tamper proof screws are in a place where I can't get a chisel on them to get them loose.\nAnyway, this is pretty painful to install, just difficult to access everything, even with the T-harness (which I would strongly recommend).\nAt first I thought my T-harness was incorrect, so I tried calling tech support, and each time after about 5 minutes it would transfer me to a voicemail box that was full...lame, just really lame. I email tech support, and got a response about 24 hours later.\nIn the future, I think I'm going to call tech support *before* I buy something like this, just to see if they answer the phone.\nAnyway, turns out the ignition connector was really hidden and the T-harness was correct, yeah, my mistake for looking in the wrong spot for the connector, but would have been easily answered by someone who's installed one before (like, umm tech support?). The wiring chart for my vehicle was correct, and everything works like it should. I would buy some of the splice connectors available here on amazon rather than their method of peeling back insulation, inserting the wire and twist/tape. You can get 25 for like $5 and it will make the job a LOT easier.\nThe DVD is lame, the youtube video is much better.\nI'm a bit conflicted as the product seems to work as it should, the installation manual does give you all the info you need, but the phone tech support being non-existent like that makes me want to not recommend the product.\nIf you are thinking about installing this just be aware it isn't for the faint of heart, you'll spend a day or two under your steering wheel in all kinds of uncomfortable positions. Your knees and elbows will take a beating, as will your finger tips from trying to get those damn connectors apart (the locking tabs are always painful). The T harness is worth the money IMO. If you've never messed with wiring, this probably isn't the best job to pick as your first.\nI ended up locating the unit under my ashtray as there was space behind the plastic cover, and the cables from the ignition/T harness *just* reached). I had to lengthen the ground wire and the door lock wires to reach.\nI cut all the unused wires from the back of the connectors.\nIn retrospect I should have just gone with a keyless entry system, as it would have been cheaper and easier to install, but I guess I'll see how useful starting it remotely on cold mornings is...", "label": 2}

However, if you go to the Tripp Lite website, find this product and go to the specifications tab, this is what you will find:\n\nLINE POWER (AC): Maintains 120V nominal sine wave output from line power source. INVERTER POWER (AC): Maintains PWM sine wave output voltage of 120 V AC (+/-5%).\n\nFreaking great.  So much for \"clean, computer grade power\".  That is a load of B.S., honestly.  If I had known, for even a second, that this unit didn't output a real sine wave, I would have purchased something else.  Apparently, you have to get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TRIPP-LITE-APS1012SW-1000-Watt-12-Volt-Inverter-Charger-Pure-Sine-Wave-120-Volt-4A-40A-Hardwire/dp/B006R64SM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TRIPP LITE APS1012SW 1000 Watt 12 Volt Inverter / Charger Pure Sine Wave 120 Volt 4A/40A Hardwire</a>&nbsp;at approximately TRIPLE the cost to get a real sine wave output on DC power.  So now I'm stuck with this thing, as I bought this thing, then researched batteries, then got that, then tested the setup out on stuff besides my furnace, then had to modify the wiring to/from my furnace by cutting it and putting an outlet in one box, and a power cord in another, so I could insert this setup in between furnace and mains power, and thus it's been more than 30 days.  Nor will Tripp Lite help me, as it \"clearly\" says in the specifications that this is a PWM output on DC power.  They will allow me to trade up to the 1012SW if I pay the difference in RETAIL prices.\n\nSo, yippee.  Just dandy.  If you buy this, make sure that you test it out within the return time on the actual equipment you want to backup power.  And if you have a pellet stove, chances are it won't work according to what the Tripp Lite representative told me.\n\n[EDIT]***FIVE STARS TO AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!***\n\nSo I called Amazon mainly to tell them that they should add the PWM output on DC info to the product page, but also with the slim hope that they might be able to do something for me.  And they WERE able to do something for me!  I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon.  This is precisely why I always try to buy from Amazon when I can![/EDIT]", "label": 0}

{"text": "It's a blessing and sometimes a shame that Haynes contracts with different writers/mechanics for their manuals. As a habit, I buy a Haynes manual whenever I buy a new(er) car. I am a backyard mechanic, which means I'll do anything which doesn't include rebuilding a transmission. I own 23 Haynes manuals. The best manuals are of course European as Haynes is a British publication. The ones I bought in Europe are all hardcover - an option not available to us here in the States. But the best part of Hayne's manuals is that in Europe, they actually tear down each car and rebuild it (like they claim on the cover), so you get insights, tips, and tricks from the actual mechanics wielding the wrench. Sometimes the writers have a sense of humor too, as in \"...Don't say we didn't warn you not to do that\" or \"Don't be afraid of this next part, it's not as hard as it looks.\" The worst by a large margin are the American models. This is an example. The worst part of this Ford manual is that Haynes capitulated to Ford (like 'Chilton's' did in the late 1970's) by filling 90% of the book with straight out-of-the-factory-technical-sheets instructions, and drawings. If that's what I wanted, I would have bought a Chilton's. Something as simple as reaching the heater core is lost completely because you have to jump around the book to so many different sections which in the end caused you to disassemble things you didn't need to, while leaving out entirely critical things you did. I have seen the creeping replacement of the Hayne's manuals vehicle-specific detailed information, with applies-to-most-models-but probably-not-yours useless factory general guidelines. Since I'll never stop doing my own maintenance, the death of the historically useful Hayne's manual for U.S. vehicles will be an influence to me on whether I make my next purchase foreign. In the meantime, vote with your wallet; buy the Chilton's for your Ford. It won't make any difference to why you are buying a repair book, and maybe a decrease in American sales will make Haynes's notice they are doing something wrong.", "label": 0}

Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.

We got a Shark petperfect II refurbished for that price and it lasted for 2 years before the battery quit charging on us.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n- Bag: The carrying bag really is convenient and keeps all the attachments from getting lost. I think more brands should adopt a similar accessory.\n- 12v power option. It would be nice if more handheld vacuums had this or included it as an option because it's very inconvenient to run an extension cord out to the car or to be using a cordless vac and have it die before you're finished.\n\nOverall:\nI wouldn't purchase this again. I know there's a lot of brands of the exact same vacuum floating around and their brand stamped on the front of it, but the design of it lets you know they're the same vacuum. For us, we need something with a better design and more power to get our car clean, not just slightly less dirty.", "label": 2}

From the Amazon product page: \"They include instructions and reusable packaging with prepaid postage for safe disposal of old cartridges.\"  Instead, all I received was a single sheet of paper stating to \"Return spent battery to an appropriate facility for proper disposal and recycling.\"  Thanks a lot!!\nThese batteries are heavy so if I have to pay for postage that will not be a trivial amount.  My local recycling center does not take these.  I am going to try Lowes.  I suspect that without the pre-paid labels many of these batteries end up in land fill which is not good.\nREVISED:  I have increased my rating from 1 star to 3 because after a good bit of digging I found an APC web page you can go to to print out a pre-paid UPS label.  I want to emphasize that this website is not provided in the documentation that comes with the replacement battery.  Why APC makes it so hard to find I have no idea.  I can only speculate that they lose money on the mail-in program and don't particularly want people to use it (perhaps they are required by law to provide it).

{"text": "Before buying this mount, measure the distance between your bike's fork dropouts to the rear wheel. Then look at the recommended crossbar spacing for your vehicle in the Yakima Q Clip instruction booklet. If the measurements are not similar (ie. rear wheel not centered over the rear crossbar, short roofline and long wheelbase bike), then the rear wheel will hang far behind the rear crossbar and there's a good chance that the rear towers will shift forward when transporting your bike. This can result in roof damage from the shifting clips and the bike's rear wheel contacting and scratching the roof.\n\nThe Boa is Yakima's most economical rooftop bike mount and it shows. If you live in a low crime neighborhood and remove your bike and rack when you are away from your car, this mount will probably work just fine for you. Or if you absolutely need to minimize the footprint of the rack when it's off your vehicle.\n\nThe Boa pod is mostly made of glass-filled polymer. There is a flimsy plastic cover that is secured by the skewer and covers the heads of the 3 hex mounting bolts. Unfortunately, even when locked, this cover can easily be pried and cracked open by hand revealing the 3 bolt heads. I complained and Yakima responded that they only provide theft deterrence and cannot guarantee against theft. This does not even approach deterrence.\n\nThe Boa mount comes with Yakima's universal locking skewer with a polymer lever, stainless rod, and round steel nut. If the skewer is closed and locked but the handle is in the wrong orientation and there's insufficient tension, then it's a simple matter to rotate the handle counterclockwise to loosen the nut and steal your bike. The lever and cam are plastic and will deform and wear with use. When no bike is loaded, the only way to secure the mount is to tighten the nut further and then close and lock the skewer. However, adjusting the nut defeats the purpose of providing a long-throw skewer.\n\nAdding a long tray converts the mount into a Copperhead mount. However, given the security concerns, I returned this mount and purchased a Yakima Steelhead mount instead. The Steelhead has a clamshell clamping design and is mostly metal. It comes with a stainless metal skewer that has a special locking pin and e-clip on the nut. When the skewer is locked, the clamshell cannot open and the skewer nut cannot be removed even if it is not tightened and tensioned against the mount body. As with the Boa, make sure that the skewer lever rests against the crossbar when locked so that it can only be turned clockwise tightening (and not loosening) the nut.\n\nIf you don't want to spend much more than the cost of the Boa but want to use your SKS lock cores, consider purchasing a Steelhead body (new or used) and a Rocky Mounts Lariat tray. You will need to drill a hole in the tray to mount the Yakima head. The Rocky Mounts crossbar mount is compatible with Yakima's round bars and comes with all hardware, and their wheel strap is also less expensive than Yakima's.\n\nIf you are using or considering Yakima Q Towers, I have a separate review of that product on Amazon.", "label": 2}

{"text": "EDIT 10/16/2013\nAfter reading about the return policy online, I decided to ship my cover back to Budge for repair.  Within two weeks of sending my cover, I received a new one in the mail, free of charge.  Yes, the first one disintegrated but the nice people at Budge decided to replace it for free.

As I went to take the cover off, it literately disintegrated in my hands.  I had a hard time getting the cover off my vehicle because it began breaking apart as it was being taken off.

That experience taught me to take the steps from the manual, and write out the \"going in, replace, and going out steps\" rather than just trust Haynes \"installation is reverse of removal\".\nHaving said that, the Haynes A4 2002-2008 manual does have a wealth of information for simpler jobs, such as cabin air filter replacement, spark plugs, etc.\nI bought the Audi A4 2002-2008 Haynes Repair Manual for my wifes A4.  Just did the front brake rotors and pads, both bought from Amazon.\nBTW: Haynes says all, repeat all, bolts, and the guide pins and + guide pin bushings must be replaced with each caliper and or rotor removal.  Ask the local Audi dealer. They'll look at you like you are strange.  They do not do it unless the bolt or guide pin is broken.  It's $33 for the caliper bolts, about 16 ea. for the caliper springs, etc, etc.  Save your money.  Pads and rotors are all that's needed.\nThe book completely missed a step that would have made the process much easier.  The caliper comes apart into more pieces than Haynes shows.  The job is still do-able, but much more difficult.  Found a video on YouTube that actually showed how to remove an additional piece that Haynes does not show.  Would have made the job take much, much less time.\nI understand that that the same model is made with different parts each year.  And sometimes different parts in same year, different factories, as with my Jeep. Haynes has to take a certain number of short cuts.  Unfortunately, sometimes those short cuts cost the do-it-yourselfer valuable hours.\nUnfortunately, Haynes fails to tell the user some extremely useful bits, like \"now turn the wheels all the way to the left (or right) before trying to reach this large bolt that requires a very long socket handle in order to break the (likely) freeze or the (definitely) torqued-down pressure. Also, they did not even take apart the caliper to 4 parts, leaving two bolted together, making the job much more difficult.\nNext time, before I even assemble my tools or buy any parts, I'm going to Youtube to QC anything in any of my Haynes manuals (BMW 325, Audi A4, and Jeep Grand Cherokee).", "label": 0}

{"text": "Built a new garage last year with a super smooth concrete floor but the creeper I've been trying to use kept getting hung-up on even the smallest of pebbles or gravel that may be on the floor. I usually ended up using cardboard cause the creeper was more trouble than what is was worth and I ended up on the floor anyway.  I'm very happy with the smooth operation of \"The Bone\" it goes in the direction you want to go and is quite comfortable to work off of.  The ad claimed you could roll over cords, tools and parts, I tried this but was unsuccessful it got hung-up, so you probably want to stick with a smooth obsticle free surface.  The creeper is somewhat hard to get on and off of because of its odd shape, but I understand that to mount a five inch wheel at each corner it would have to be shaped as is.  For what I need this creeper for it will serve me nicely but don't plan on using it on gravel floors or on dirt, you'll probably be disappointed plus the price is about double what it should be.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Absolutely useless for a permanent or even a semi-permanent repair. Followed all directions to the letter... I even set a timer to make sure i was letting the \"cement\" have the correct amount of time to \"dry\" before applying the patch (60 seconds)... Then let it \"cure\" for twice the amount of time specified (two hours)....  If you have ever glued anything together will rubber cement, like a picture in a scrapbook, you will have a good idea of how well these patches will hold, which is barely at all.... Brush up against them and they will peel off (even with the corners rounded)...\n\nThey will work for a (very) temporary repair of a pin sized hole if you are out camping or have no other options available... But they are not advertised as a temporary fix, they are advertised as a repair.... So i cannot give this any more than one star (i would give it half a star if i could)... This patch didn't even last through the night, i ended up getting my bottle of gorilla glue and gluing the SOB back on there after it fell off in about an hour... And the patch was on the bottom so i wasn't even rubbing my body on it or anything. (i don't advise using gorilla glue, as it dries stiff and is not safe for some plastics, but it was my only option at the time.)\n\nDo not waste your time and money... Either get a bicycle repair kit, or another option is flex seal or somthing similar if it is a small pinhole.... even a drop of super glue would work better than these patches.... I cant beleive i spent $5 on these.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Coleman Cable 08662 25-Feet Heavy-Duty Booster Cables, 4-Gauge.  I bought the \"best\" January 2013 and just stored them in the trunk for some future emergency.  Had a totally dead battery in Hyundai 6 months later (dome light left on), and pulled up 2nd car (Expedition).  Once hooked up, all power was restored to Hyundai dashboard lights, horn, windows, etc.  But on turning the key to start, all voltage disappeared and starter didn't even click.  Worked half an hour getting a firmer clamp on top post terminals, letting the Expedition run at 1500 RPM to charge up the Hyundai battery a little... all with no success.  There was so much resistance in the Coleman cables that once real amperage attempted to flow, there was a complete voltage drop across the cables.  A friend loaned me a ratty old pair of cheap cables that started the car instantaneously.  Were the Colemans really 4 gauge?  Or perhaps manufacturing defect where cable welded to clamp.  They were completely useless.  Tried to return but Amazon web site said they had to be returned in 30 days... but, hurray for Amazon.com, when I explained the problem by e-mail that upon first use, they failed, Amazon approved the return 6 months after purchase.  Its not obvious how to test jumper cables when first purchased and you don't have a dead battery to try out the cables.  I will buy a different brand from Amazon.com. And when they arrive, I think I'll unhook a battery cable from the battery and test the cables jumped to the open cable when I receive them, rather than \"assuming\" they're good and just putting them in the trunk.

Amazon should make more of an effort to label items that fall under the Non-Returnable section as not all items in that area are obvious to the average consumer.\n\nSo save your money, buy some regular jumper cables, and, as you are obviously reading this online, Google how to use them if you don't know how (that's right ladies, I'm talking to you - and don't raise your hackles at me in feminist outrage, I'm female too.)\n\nIn short, if you still want to get this, be advised that this is considered a hazardous material and cannot be returned.", "label": 0}

In consideration of that concern, make sure you order the plastic holder, and the small plastic pin cover. Keep the pin covered with a marine rust preventative.

{"text": "I like this light, and with a few changes it would be a 5-Star product.  The light is nice and bright, and if someone is following you at night, the extra light makes it really easy to spot your vehicle.  In my opinion, you can never have enough lights in the back of your vehicle at night.  The more visible you are, the better your chance of being seen before someone rear-ends you!\n\nSome reviewers have commented on how far out the back of your hitch this sticks.  Mine sticks out a little, but not nearly as much as other reviewers have claimed.  I guess it depends a lot on your hitch receiver, but if they put the hole much closer to the face, it wouldn't fit some longer hitch receivers.\n\nImprovement 1:  The wire harness goes out the back of the light, and is bent forward so that it can go out through a small hole in the front bottom of the housing.  Every hitch receiver I have had is open on both ends, so I would rather see the wire go straight back from the light so that it can pass through the back of the receiver and then be fed to the 4 pin coupling.\n\nImprovement 2: Fit it with a spring loaded pins like the ones used when nesting two tubular pipes together (on old style tents, pruning poles, etc.) so that you do not have to use a hitch pin.\n\nImprovement 3: Have an option that uses a 7-pin connector so that it can also have an auxiliary back-up light.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The light bulb is wonderful.  It's halogen, very bright but it heats up the fixture, so be mindful when sitting in reverse.  Good idea to keep it less than a couple minutes.  More later.  The Alert:  It is supposed to \"BEEP\".  When it sounds Feeble and sounds like hungry sheep or a duck and people are looking, It will soon be silent.  I drive for a living - an excess than 40k/yr.  I have a number of vans, each with at least one of these units in the drivers rear.  The beepers rarely last me a whole year in my active vehicle.  I' sure most people would do much better than I, as I get a saltwater bath more than once a week and every day do many miles of unpaved roads full of potholes and water in the winter and potholes and dust in the summer.  Just a few days ago (Wed) I replaced the unit again.  It was lighting up but the beep only lasted a week.  Tonight (Sat), I just moved my van to unload and silence again.  The light was good, (It's very dark here and I'd know instantly if one was out).  I opened the door and peered back.  Lots of light.  I stopped the engine and turned on the key...Light but Silence.  There's only one circuit in these units.  Whenever they light, they beep and vice versa.  If only one function is working, the problem is not the wiring in your vehicle, It's the unit. Recently I've had a lot of failures.  I count 4 failures now in the 2 years I've had this van and now I'm going to write the company to avoid a fifth. Very frustrating to say the least.  I've been using these for better than 15 years.  On one occasion I know the Alarm warning did pay off.  Funny story involving a tourist but I'll spare you.  I do know my back-up alarm did the job that day.\n\nNote: It's really easy to order the wrong unit.  The 3156 bulb is the rectangular bulb socket.  The other style is the round bulb, (older 1156 style).  More about the heat...My personal experience.  If the backup light fixture is really dirty or gets cracked and dirt/dust gets inside, it will overheat easily.  The plastic lens won\\t melt or anything like that.  The bulb socket  gets cooked and deteriorates over time till it no longer functions and you have replace the whole unit which may or may not include the whole tail light fixture. This is intended for myself as well:  \"We all know that proper attention to one's vehicle is the best way. to go.\"\n\nUp Date:  (Several months later.)  I wrote the Co.  They said \"send the bad ones\".  I sent 3, They quickly sent replacements and I was impressed by speed, attitude and service.  One did not work, One worked w/lite only and one worked w/lite but faint useless beep. No Comment.., Except yesterday I drove one of my older vehicles w/1156 (Round Socket bulb backup alarm) - more than 8 yrs old... works great.\n\nMy Solution.  Installed another mfg's beeper (only) unit inside behind tail light, securing w/cable tie.  Installed $40.00 (22 watt LED cluster) in backup lite socket.  Brightest light I could buy, actually hurts the eyes but really lights up the behind.  And... with almost no heat to destroy the fixture.", "label": 0}

Its great for breaking the bead and removal of the old tire, but other than providing a stable platform, isn't much help in mounting new tires; be prepared to resort to multiple pry bars and a lot of effort (I found that the \"bead breaker\" attachment is good at initially securing the bead below the rim while mounting).  Also, anything more substantial than a wheel barrow tire isn't going to seal when attempting to pressurize, even with a ratchet strap (DO NOT ignite ether in a small tire to seal).

They seem perfectly good to me.\n\nI've seen lots of complaints about the paper being too thin in other reviews.  Sure, it's a bit thinner than perhaps the average book (maybe similar to a newspaper), but still perfectly usable.  If you are ripping the pages or pulling them out of the manual - my question to those that say this sort of thing - have you used a book before?\n\nI've done 3 recent services on our hondas\n\n1) Engine mount replacement\n2) radiator flush\n3) EGR valve replacement\n\nI used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.\n\nRadiator flush is just the same really as factory manual.\n\nEGR valve replacement was a snap - hardly worth mentioning.\n\nSo, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).\n\nI give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.  Solid manual from what I can see though.", "label": 1}

I only had it on the hitch when towing, and I removed it once towing was completed. But then I started towing a lot and left it in place for the last 1.5 years. Recently, I needed to take it off my hitch and found the lock was seized. Nothing worked to unlock it, so I had to cut it off; a long process that I did not have time for since I was in a hurry to get on the road. Once I pulled out the pin, I saw the pin was badly rusted within the receiver. So, in 1.5 years, this lock rusted fast and became useless.\n\nHere is the good:\n1. It is sturdy and seems to be very secure.\n2. The rubber key cover works as advertised and lasts a long time.\n3. Easy to operate.\n4. Out of the way from my chain connections.\n5. Fits my hitch very well. I have seen other reviewers complain about it being too long for class 3 and 4 hitches. I can't figure out why they have a problem with that. There is very little side-to-side motion, which does not affect anything.\n\nHere is the bad:\n1. Chrome plated. This means the metal it is made from is not corrosion resistant.\n2 You have to keep the lock lubricated very frequently (like once or twice a month) to get decent life out of it (too much maintenance for me).\n3. The corrosion problem could lead to structural failure without warning. That could mean losing your trailer on the road.\n4. The lock mechanism can seize up from corrosion. If you end up having to cut this off your hitch, there is possibility of damaging the chrome or paint of your bumper because the cutter can and probably will slip.\n\nBecause of the corrosion problem, I would not buy this again. I would pay more for a receiver lock that is corrosion proof. Too bad those are hard to find, but I did find a Fulton that claims to be rust proof; so I will try that one.", "label": 0}

{"text": "My bike rack manufacturer asks too much money for a tow hitch lock. I read people purchasing tire lug nut locks and modifying the bolt with a longer one. The inside of the lock is concave to fit a lug nut. I had to flatten it out by installing it and tightening down the entire way. This then meant that I had to grind down the perimeter to get it to fit inside the top, outer shell. This took a little doing but fortunately I have a bench grinder. Once modified, everything fit perfectly and my bike rack is safely locked.\n\nThree stars only because it does work but I think the mechanism inside, that you cannot see from the photo, could be manufactured much beefier in the tradition of Master Lock.

I put this system in but couldn't find the power lock wires that I needed to. So I went ahead and figured I could go without the locks. This is where it got interesting. After spending hours and getting everything hooked up,I pushed the start button. The Trailblazer started........and shut off. Tried it again and the same thing happened over and over.

I went back hooked the lock wires from the remote starter to the bypass module. Went through the reset list and nothing happened. After a hour of trying to wire this and that I came to realize that it must have to go through the anti-theft system itself and I couldn't find those wires to wire it up. I called support and left messages to which I still haven't heard anything yet to date. I emailed support and still haven't heard anything yet to date.

{"text": "Because you can't see down into the tank, the only way you'll know if the tank is full--should you choose to use this method--is to keep pouring until there's stagnant fuel above the filter.  Sure, it'll stop flowing when the tank is properly filled, but if you over-poured, you still have to figure out what to do with the fuel left over in the funnel.\n\nPros:\n- It fits well in Coleman appliances and doesn't fall out.\n- It has a built-in filter.\n- The air vent keep the fuel from glugging as it flows.\n\nCons:\n- You're still pouring directly from those stupid, cumbersome Coleman fuel cans.  Good luck not spilling any as it glugs into the funnel.\n- Unless you're checking the fuel level in the tank regularly and manually, you'll overfill the funnel.  Sure, it'll \"stop filling at correct fuel level\" but you won't know that until stagnant fuel rises above the filter.  That means you'll have have to either a) find a way to transfer the fuel in the bottom of the funnel and spout back to the can, or b) suck it up and lose it on the ground when you pull the funnel out of the appliance.\n- Using the funnel, I rarely fill a tank without spilling an annoying amount of fuel either from the funnel or from the can itself.\n- Since some appliances (like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-533-Stove/dp/B0009PUQAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman 533 Stove</a>) sit so low to the surface (ground, concrete, table, etc.), it's difficult to maneuver a full can of fuel without spilling it.  \"Why don't you just put it on the edge of a table or something?\" you might ask.  Well, I rarely fill a tank without spilling some fuel (leftovers, funnel, spout, or can), which inevitably runs down the side of the appliance and pools under its base.  I can fill it on a raised surface...IF it's a surface that won't get messed up by spilled fuel.\n\nThe best way to use this funnel is to pour slowly and manually check the fuel level regularly.  Don't rely on the silly, hyped \"stops filling at correct fuel level\" if you want to avoid spills.\n\nI'll take the funnel when backpacking.  If car camping or fueling at home, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-Fuel-Filler-Assembly/dp/B0009PURJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman Fuel Filler Assembly</a>&nbsp;works a lot better and overall results in a lot less spilled fuel.\n\nGosh, who knew I could say so much about a funnel.", "label": 2}

Also it's nice that it is very lightweight compared to the stainless steel ones.

The back side of the locket is smooth so it is comfortable laying against my chest.\n\nI do have a couple suggestions for improving it.  The first would be to make the chain adjustable (starting with a shorter length).  I rarely wear a necklace with a pendant hanging that low, and so I actually used a safety pin to secure it at a shorter length when I have worn it.  The second thing would be to make the pads thicker or include a spacer to go behind them so that they show up through the latticework better.  The locket is deeper than the thickness of the pads.  The pads aren't too thin in general, but the way they sit in the locket with the extra space makes it so that the color of the felt doesnt show up much at all.  I just put a small piece of tissue paper folded up behind mine which is a little inconvenient, but it pushes the pad forward enough that it looks better to me.", "label": 1}

I wasted hours trying to move the car, change the position of the sensor, unplug and replug to get it to recalibrate, etc. and no matter what I did, it consistently proved useless.  Most of the time the lights don't even come on, or it gets to yellow when I'm all the way in the garage, but sometimes it goes to red while I'm still barely with the nose in.\n\nThe only really useful suggestion they offer for how to correct this kind of problem is to change the height of the sensor, but they provide very little by way of guidelines of what height to move it to.  I followed their guidelines, then tried various other heights.  For my efforts, I now have a lot of unnecessary screw-holes in my wall.

The first two weeks, it was fine. Then it all of a sudden, with no warning, stopped working. Whether using the cigarette lighter outlet in the car or the AC adapter - it was dead.

Amazon allowed us under the circumstances to return both cooler and AC adapter (minus 20% which I can't kick too much about).

Do not put this in your vehicle, drain it into a 5 gallon gas tank to transport to Autozone.  It's better that way anyway so you don't have to go everytime you change your oil.  When you drain the pan make sure the big lid is facing up the best you can.  You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.  Use a big flat metal pan or a piece of cardboard if you don't want stains on your floor.  If they would improve the threads on the caps, this product would be perfect.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This manual does pale in comparison to a Bently, but so do all other manuals. I have found that the manual is an excellent guide for anyone with some mechanical know-how, and it provides the most comprehensive information available. There are things that are a little inacurate that I have found, or have seen other sources that contradict how things work... But even the Subaru factory repair manuals have this problem. My major criticism of this manual is it does not get into describing what are 'common' failures; other Haynes manuals that I have picked up ocasionally hinted at what kinds of failures the owner can 'expect' to experience. In my opinion, there should be an section devoted to the whens, whys and hows of headgasket failure, oil seal leaks, and valve cover leaks. My second criticism is that it doesn't explain part numbers, nor does it describe some repair materials well enough; like saying 'anerobic sealant' or 'gasket maker' where Subaru technical manuals very clearly describe what materials should be used.\n\nCombine this with all the documentation that is out there from the major Subaru message boards, and I doubt there is any repair you can't accomplish.

{"text": "I've used Haynes' and Chilton's books for years, but this isn't their best effort.  I have a few big complaints.\n\n1) A very, very great deal of information is generic automotive data that's probably copied and pasted between all their books, and in a couple of instances, I found some of this generic information that wasn't particularly correct in the case of Civics.\n\n2) The book spreads itself across multiple *generations* of Civics and Civic body styles AND tries to tackle CRVs at the same time.  It's just spread too thin.  It's sometimes difficult to hone in on the data that's appropriate for your vehicle.  It doesn't seem to cover Si's at all.\n\n3) I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but the book doesn't dig very deep.  Too many systems explanations give only a cursory overview, 101 level troubleshooting (check the fuses, check the seals), then we're admonished to take the car to a dealer if we still have issues.  This is the treatment given for systems as simple as the power locks and emissions.\n\nIf you're only doing simple tune-up work, and you're maybe after an easy-difficulty repair or two, this book might work.  If really want to learn about your car in depth, or you want to make sure you don't get caught short in the middle of a job with insufficient or incomplete information, or if you're going to take on more difficult jobs, you'll want a better book.\n\nFor about 20 bucks more, you can have the complete factory shop manuals right here on Amazon, and they're on CD so you can search the contents and print what you want before attempting a job.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2006-2007-2008-2009-Honda-Civic-Shop-Manual-CD-W-Etm/dp/B0042XGGCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2006 2007 2008 2009 Honda Civic Shop Manual CD W/Etm</a>\n\nBishko reprints the Honda official manuals on CD, and you'll have the exact information for your particular car.  All of it.  Enough to tear down the engine and transmission and build it back up to factory specs.  And anything else you can imagine.\n\nGranted, factory service manuals sometimes assume you have access to tools and equipment you either don't have or can't get at all, but I'd rather read, know, and understand than be told \"this is over your head, take it to the dealer\".  Often times, specialized tools can be improvised, or Internet forum wisdom can help you work around your lack of factory test equipment.\n\nAgain, the book isn't terrible, I just expect considerable depth in a repair manual, and felt like I got something that was basically a little better than the owner's manual.  If that's all you're after, perhaps this book is fine.  If not, you have other affordable options.", "label": 2}

I call tech support and they tell me the only way to operate this unit with my car is to use the factory transponder to unlock the car first.  Well that sucks who wants to do that, + you have to have two key fobs with you,+ if you forget to unlock first the alarm will go off.\nSo I figure out a way around that by taking the FASD wire and connected it to my unlock wire in the door.  This way before it remote starts the car it will unlock the door like you put the key in the door and unlocked it.  The tech support said there was no way to do this\n\nNow it should work it starts and runs for a few seconds then turns off and keeps repeating.  I connect the TACH wire from the remote start to the tachometer feed in the car.  Program the unit for TACH operation.  Then teach it to learn the TACH.  Same dam problem.\nCall tech support and ask him about the problem.  He says the unit is not seeing noise after the car starts.  I tell him that's why I connected the TACH I also know the unit learned the TACH because it confirmed it did when I was programming it.  His advice is to remove the TACH wire and connect to an ignition wire.  To me this is crap half ass solution.  Asked what signal the remote start is looking for so I could go out with an oscilloscope and check the TACH output or make it look like the unit wants and he could not tell me.\nI cannot trust this unit without the TACH connected.  Last thing I want is to be replacing the battery or the started because this unit kept trying to start the car over and over again when i am inside waiting for the car to warm up.\n\nYou get what you pay for (the RS1100 and RS1200 are the same thing I asked tech support)", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm quite impressed with this handy light. It's almost like a glow stick, holds nicely in your hand and seems like it's well made for everything it offers. I have many reasons to like this light... the first one being that it is rechargeable. So many times you go through so many batteries on with flashlights. This charges the same as a cell phone,  it actually is that same as my phone I currently have. The charging cord had a USB end to connect to a computer, adapter or you could charge in a vehicle using the cell phone charging adapter. I have a mega power pack we use for charging devices when camping that would also work well to charge this in emergency situations.\n  Another reason I really like this light is because it is LED ,the light is very bright with 4 different modes of brightness and a mode where the light flashes.  With the bulb being LED you get longer battery life on a charge. It comes with 2 carrying /wrist cords that can be attached at either end or both. I find this would work excellent to hang this light inside of a tent etc. ..The size of this is also nice it will pack in just about anywhere.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it next camping season.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Very disappointed in this Haynes manual for the Mini.  My first exposure to a Haynes manual was as a teen when I had my old PoS Triumph Spitfire.  That manual was my bible.  EVERY part of that car was taken apart and rebuilt, with copious images to guide you.\n\nI got this manual hoping to do some basic service (not a rebuild) on the CVT transmission on my son's PoS Mini.  The section for the CVT is less than a page, vaguely worded, and has not one single image.  The entire auto trans section, mostly on the 6-speed, is a whole three pages.  It was completely useless for my immediate needs.  I would imagine the other parts of the manual are ok, but they sure wanted nothing to do with the automatics in this one.  You buy a manual to fix things yourself, and I ended up having to take it somewhere.  In hindsight, there is better information on this on internet forums.\n\nMy next project was to try to adjust the headlights since they seemed to be pointing right at the ground in front of the car, and that section outright said to take it to a Mini dealer.  A dealer...for headlight adjustments...  So I went outside and had a look, and within about 60 seconds had located two large, very obvious, plastic adjusting screws on each headlight pod.  One was marked L-R and the other U-D on each pod.  I guess Haynes writers couldn't decipher what those letters meant.  You could even adjust them with your bare hands.  It just required a lot of lowering and raising the hood to check the adjustments, but even a monkey could have figured that out.", "label": 2}

It was too late to return it to Amazon. Figured I would call the company and see what help was available. I left my name and number. No response at all. Partly my fault because I misread the warranty info on Amazon. The physical club warranty is for parts only. Pretty sure I would had had to pay for shipping to repair it. Since I never received a return call, it's just a thought. The actual warranty promoted in the description is for damage to your vehicle if it is stolen with the Club Lock in place. The registration form which comes with The Club that you have to mail (no online registration) requests all kinds of ancillary information, such as your income, auto insurance company, license plate number, and other otherwise personal info that should be kept confidential until needed, in my opinion. I forgot the time period restriction for the registration but you have to include an original receipt for the purchase - no copies. You can question the manufacturer - Winners International.

{"text": "This is good if you have a car that the battery is not easily accessible.  If the battery is accessible, you would do better using regular jumper cables.  The reason for this is that the cigarette lighter does not allow much current, so it takes a very long time to charge a battery to the point where it has enough power to start the car.  In every circumstance whether your battery is marginally low (just low enough not to crank the starter) or completely dead, the time this device takes to charge the battery compared to jumper cables is exponentially longer.  Additionally because it takes so long to charge a battery, expect the device to get hot the longer you use it.  I would imagine this is why several people have complained that the device stopped working.  The longer the charge cycle the hotter it gets and can cause the circuitry to burnout.  The developer should have put a cutoff circuit to prevent this, but it appears this is not the case.", "label": 2}

Would be a 5-star except for one big fault: The flow gate opening/closing mechanism is poorly designed. If you only want the gate all the way open with full flow, you will probably do OK, although the control arm and connectors look a little flimsy and don't inspire confidence. If you want to reduce the flow to 1/2, or 1/4 or 1/8, like I did, you can't start with the gate closed, because you have no way of knowing how wide you are opening it. The workaround for me was to simply set the gate, turn on the spreader, pour in the seed, and run back to the driver's seat and go. At 1/8 open, that worked fine for me with minimal waste.", "label": 2}

No matter how hard I tried I couldn't pry it open with just my hands. I had to use two pairs of jewellery pliers and actually apply quite a bit of force to get it to open. I was hoping that it was just a bit stiff the first time I tried opening it, however I have to use the pliers each time.  The finish too is not up to the quality I expected for the price. I know that it's not real silver so it may eventually tarnish however when you turn this locket around its already tarnished and looks like it's been worn.\n\nThe bronze one isn't any better. While I can open it this one looks even more used. Not only is it also tarnished on the back already it looks well worn. The hinges have some\"thing\" in them. It looks like grease and maybe fibers though I'm not sure what exactly it is. They may just be fibers but it looks like someone got their hair caught in the hinges and just cut it out. Not attractive at all.\n\nI was hoping to give these as a gift and was so excited that I even purchased another set in another design and I'm worried that those are going to be just as bad. Neither one of these can be gifted and they're barely wearable. From the other reviews it seems that this product is hit or miss on whether it arrives in good condition or not.

The next time we stopped, we plugged the charger into an outlet, and left the unit charging for 24 hours, and it again read fully charged.  We watched a two hour movie using only a dvd player, 19\" LCD tv, and a set of computer speakers... (I made sure to turn everything else off, and switch the fridge and water heater to propane.) and by the end of the movie the battery was fully discharged.  Based on my experience, I would only purchase this item for emergency lighting, or other low-powered uses.  I can't imagine a powertool, or other high-powered device lasting long enough to justify the high cost of this item.  I'll keep it for recharging batteries, and powering my phone while off-grid.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have mixed feelings about this product.  I bought it to use in a camper in conjunction with a deep cycle battery and a generator.\n\nThere are three settings on the face.  The first is inverter mode which provides AC power from the battery to anything plugged in and automatically switches to an AC source when AC current is fed to it (by my generator).  Then switches back to DC inverter when the generator is shut off.  It also charges the battery when the generator is on in this mode.  Nice, right.  This is the mode I thought I would be using most of the time and I liked how it was all automatic.\n\nIn truth, the inverter is not efficient enough to leave in this mode.  Even with nothing plugged in, it slowly sucked the life out of my battery.  So I found myself switching to the DC only mode just to shut off the drain. Being that the inverter is on the floor behind a door out of sight, I had to get down and do this.  The remote that they sell for an extra $100 for this should be a standard piece that comes with the inverter.\n\nSo now, I'm basically using this as a charger for my battery instead of an inverter as I had originally planned, manually switching to charge mode when I turn on my generator.  It may work better for other applications other than off grid camping such as in emergency power failure situations.  I can also see it working better if I would add a solar panel to feed the battery at the rate of inverter discharge, but that seems like an expensive fix.\n\nI'm not sure if it's possible, but it would be nice to have the inverter kick on whenever an appliance draws 120volts.  Event writing that sentence, I already realize that this is probably not likely.\n\n****  UPDATE  ****  3-7-13\n\nI've had this for almost a year now and at this point, any time it is charging, it never goes above 13.5 volts and only 3 amps.  Even when it should be in absorption mode.  Something is not working right on it.  It has been this way for a while now but since I have added solar panels to my set up, I haven't been using it to charge my battery.  Also, as I had previously stated, the inverter sucks a lot of phantom power so whenever I need AC, I am using my cheap 100W inverter.  In short, it is not serving any purpose and is not working the way it should.  If I had to do it again, I would not purchase this, but would set up several smaller sized inverters and have a separate 3 stage charger, perhaps the Tender Plus for times when I want to charge the battery on shore power.  The main reason I bought it in the first place was the convenience of having inverter and charger in one compact unit.

{"text": "Let me start out by saying I have installed at least a 2 dozen different remote starters so far. I know how these things work and how they are supposed to work. I have installed remote starters in many different brands of vehicles with and without transponder keys. I did read the install manual from front to back before purchasing the unit and then before I installed the thing. I did solder the wires like the manual suggested instead of the wire crimp method. I even double checked that I was using the proper wires with a VOM and compared the results with the wire diagram Bulldog had on there web site. They did have a couple errors for the Honda Element 2004-2008 diagram.\n\nSo after installing the remote starter and the transponder bypass module, module 791. By the way, the 791 module is a cheap piece of crap. The key almost falls out of the thing when you finally get it open to place the key in the loop. The key can just flop around in there and more than likely short out some of the electronics. Now the starter is installed and the moment of truth arrives. I hit the start button and........... the car turns over but won't start. I double check my wires and check the transponder module. Everything is correct. I try it again. Nothing. The starter try's 3 times then quits. I unplug the thing and check my wires once again. This time the car starts. I didn't change a thing. I feel pretty good. 30 seconds later, the car shuts off. God F@#$%ing dammit POS!!!!!! Now I am pissed!!!!! There has to be a problem with the transponder key bypass to shut the car down. I put a key in the ignition. Same thing. I took it out of the car and tried to bench test it the thing just starts and stops.\n\nSo let's fast forward 4+ hours of troubleshooting. Conveniently the DIY kit tech support is not available on the weekend. There hours are like 9:30 to 5pm. How convenient, a DIY kit with tech support with normal hours. Because all DIY people install stuff during the normal work week hours. I write them a long email about the problems and what I did to troubleshoot the thing. They write back, yup it's bad please send it back with a $25 check. That's it, you pissed me off. I packed it back up and returned it to Amazon.\n\nSo my advice is stay away form this thing like the plague. It is a piece of crap. I wasted at least 5 hours with this thing. I can normally install a car starter in a hour or so. I was trying to install this without my wife knowing so that Xmas morning she could have a remote start key fob in her stocking to just start her car and be on her way. To late now. Thanks Bulldog for building a total piece of crap. Now I have all there wiring tied into the car that needs to get taken out for the new one and it's too late to reinstall a new one to make it a surprise. So I now have to wrap up another one as a gift. That just sucks. I mean seriously, does your wife or significant other want to open up a remote starter that isn't installed? No, I don't think so. Then they have to wait to get it installed. I have done this type of thing for other were it gets installed before xmas and it is awesome to see the look on there face when the car starts. So I will never purchase a Bulldog product again or ever recommend it. I will be sure to recommend other brands as they actually DO work.\n\nSeriously disappointed", "label": 0}

Mounted it in the back of my truck and drove around for a couple weeks.\n\nOnce I got out to the campsite though, inverter was now broken.

{"text": "This tool accepts four sizes of blind rivets and secures them effectively and straightforwardly.  There is no need to access the other side of the pieces you are riveting together, provided you can drill them and compress them together from one side.  To use the riveter, simply insert the flanged end of a rivet into the opening in the nose, press the unflanged end of the rivet into a hole of the proper diameter, and squeeze the handles.  The rivet will expand against the sides of the hole, holding the pieces together with a compression fit, like a nail.\nBe aware that this tool does blind riveting, not through riveting.  The effectiveness of the connection depends on close tolerances and hard materials.  The rivets are fundamentally hollow cylinders of metal with small flanges on one end.  A bit of wire much like a finishing nail passes through the rivet and out the flanged end.  The tool grips the wire and pulls it through the rivet so that the \"nailhead\" on the unflanged side of the rivet causes it to mushroom slightly.\nIf you need a more secure connection like that provided by a through bolt, nut, and washers, and have access to the opposite side of the pieces to be connected, a through riveter would be a better choice.", "label": 2}

I just felt like writing this review because most of the reviews for this item are suspiciously positive and written in questionable English.\n\nI bought this because I'm somewhat obsessive about keeping my car clean, and it was getting silly pumping quarters into the gas station's vacuum every week. Now that I got to try it out for the first time, I have to say that it works as well as I expected. First thing you should know is that it isn't terribly strong. It can't be. No vacuum running off of a low-wattage 12v power source like your car's cigarette lighter will ever be powerful. Don't compare it to a house vacuum or the gas-station vac which is easily consumes 10x the current. You'll be disappointed. What this thing is good for is vacuuming up normal amounts of dirt/sand from the carpet and dust from the center console, especially that weird dust that falls to the bottom of the cupholders and in the shift boot (dead skin cells I'm told). In fact it in a way it's a bit more effective than the gas station vac because of the brush attachment, and the fact that the nozzle can fit into smaller areas. The brush attachment makes all the difference in the world. The LED also light is actually quite helpful for seeing what you're doing in the darker parts of your car.\n\nWhat it's NOT good for is sucking up 4lbs of Cheerios off the floor of a minivan. So if you have kids and routinely need to clean up massive messes, this might not do it for you.\n\nPro tip: Have your engine running while you use it. The system voltage is higher (usually around 14volts vs 12volts with the engine off) and the vac will be a little stronger.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have had a cold air humidifier in the past, but never a diffuser, so I am writing this review from that perspective.  This product is smaller than I expected, even with the pictures.  The one with the person holding it with hands to scale is most appropriate if you are trying to determine its size.  It is easy to set up, although it was disappointing that it only has a USB charger and not a regular electrical plug as that was not clear from the product description.  The place to insert the charger is under the unit with a small lip for the wire, which was sort of awkward at first because it has to be pushed hard to fit or else it sticks up and makes the bottom uneven, resulting in a wobbly unit.\n\nI used water and essential oils in this and spent a few minutes examining it and then took a nap with it on.  It does a good job of diffusing the scent of the essential oils; you can smell them almost immediately after turning them on.  However, I would definitely say that this is more of a diffuser than a humidifier.  Due to its small size, it does not really put out much steam, so its impact on the humidity in the air is negligible compared to an actual humidifier.  It is almost soundless, but it makes a gentle blowing sound and you can hear a bit of water bubbling, which I found to be relaxing.

They all had one common problem - the battery. Rechargeable battery life is not holding up very long on these devices, and it takes several hours to recharge it. Most of the time when you need to vacuum, often the vacuum is dead because out of battery.\n\nThis Hotor DC 12 Volt 106 watts Wet and Dry handheld vacuum with long power cord eliminates that problem. Not only vacuum dry debris, this vacuum also can vacuum wet items or liquid spills. When you ready to vacuum, the battery (capacity) is not the limit. You can vacuum much longer and ready to go at anytime. Best of all, there is air filter to prevent dust going out on the other end  this is might help if people have minor allergies (note: I believed the filter is not HEPA). Besides that great feature, the extension hose, crevice tool and brush attachment work perfectly.\n\nPros:\n-  DC 12 volt (no battery problems)\n-  Wet and Dry Vacuum\n-  Portable\n-  Lightweight\n-  Long car lighter cable (16.5 feet)\n-  Easy to empty dust bowl\n-  Easy to Use and handle\n-  Great build material\n-  Great Price\n-  Air Filter (to prevent debris and dust coming out\n  from other end)\n-  Great Accessories (Storage Carrying Bag, Crevice\n  Tool, Extension hose and Brush)\n-  Great for car\n-  Great Warranty\n\nCons:\n-  None", "label": 1}

{"text": "This tool is a usable option if you do occasional work and need something inexpensive.  I would not use it if I were doing brakes all day. The tool is a nice concept - hand held, compact, etc - but it has some engineering flaws.\n\nFirst off, read the instructions.  The tool will probably not work out of the box.  There is an eccentric on the moving handle pivot that allow you to set die spacing and crimp pressure.  If you have it set too high, two things will happen:  1. the dies will cam over, i.e. toggle, and your flare will be off center (see my pic) 2. your tube will get crushed.  The stationary turrent die has a weak detent to hold it in place, and high pressure will cause it to move.  You don't need a ton of pressure to hold soft tubing, especially something like copper tube, or copper-nickel brake line.  Second, you'll probably want a RoFlare DF style adapter if you do double flares. You can't easily fit a standard button style flare adapter next to your tube to measure the initial stickout.\n\nYou can turn the tall hex shaped towers with a wrench to fine tune the initial die alignment, however this is mostly cosmetic. This tool relies on the tube to align the die blocks. Light pressure on the die faces is required to align them right before you close the handle. Turrets need to be checked to make sure they don't toggle.  If you do all that, it makes good centered flares without deforming the tube.  It does leave light marks in softer tube, but it does not affect function.  You'll want to grease the threads on the clamp, and make sure you use the correct lube (brake fluid for brakes, etc) when making your flares.\n\nIf you switch sizes - like going from 3/16 to 1/4 - you may have to adjust the cam again.  You'll also have to adjust it if you switch tube types.  This is why it's ok for home use, but not for high volume use.... too much adjusting.  The whole tool flexes when the clamp is tightened, and since it puts pressure on the edge of the die blocks, they do \"splay\" out. This results in a somewhat pinched tube neck just under the edge of the flare.  Again, not pretty but functional.  If I had known all this, I probably would not have bought it, but since I have it I'll use it.", "label": 2}

After researching on Amazon, I bought this HOTOR 4in1 Car Vacuum Cleaner since it also comes with a tire pressure monitor and pump.\nThe package comes with quite a few things. There are HOTOR Car Vacuum Cleaner, Extension Hose, Brush Attachment, valve tube, Operation Manual, Carrying Bag, and 3 different Pump Tips for Inflation. The attached cigarette car charger comes with a pretty long cord at 14.76 feet. There are 3 buttons on top of the vacuum cleaner. The button in the front is a release button for the dirt bin and to access the filter. The button (switch) on the handle has 3 modes - Vacuum, OFF, and Pump. The very last button activates LED light. There is no home AC output adapter included in the package.\nPROs:\n- Wet/Dry cleaner. This vacuum works with dirt as well as liquid. This comes very handy after rainy or snowy days.\n- Good suction. The vacuum is rated at 100W and it's able to pickup most dirt/ food leftover on my car's carpet and chairs, except those ones that are really sticky. It picks up hairs as well but I usually have to try a few times.\n- Bonus tire pressure monitor, pump, and pump tips. It's nice that HOTOR included a few different types of tips in the package so I can use this to pump balloons, balls, and kids' bike tires when we're outside. I haven't tried using the pump to pump car tires but it might be too difficult for a small unit like this.\n- LED light. There is a LED light near the front part of the handle. It's quite useful in the dark and when I am trying to clean up the car inside garage.\n- Washable filter. I prefer using filters that's washable as it saves money in the long run. There is also a handle on the back of filter for easier removal. There is only one filter included in the package though.", "label": 1}

The chains are rather long for the necklaces so that they hang low on the chest, so it is easy to tuck away if you want and use your body heat to help warm the oil within the necklace as well as lift it away from your body far enough to smell it yourself or allow someone else to smell it without getting too much into your personal space either.  I like the length of the necklace. I think if you want to wear it shorter, although the chain isn't designed for it, I think the hook clasp that it has might be able to clasp on the links in the chain to be able to shorten it.\nThe felt pads that came with the necklaces are great quality as well. They are the perfect size for the necklaces, no having to squeeze them into the necklace and they aren't too small either. You can also only barely see the color of the pad through the filigree so it doesn't look weird either. The felt pads are nice and thick too, so that it holds a good amount of oil to last you throughout the day as well.

The necklace arrived in a black box with the company name on it, the necklace and felt scent pads placed inside nicely - packaged like it could be given as a gift. The pendant itself is made out of a good quality, surgical grade stainless steel which will not discolor and looks bright and shiny. It seems to be very durable and well-made. The cutout pattern itself is quite lovely. I'm not so much a fan of the chain; it has a tendency to kink and pinch my neck and doesn't have a larger sized link on the end for ease of clasping. I will most likely replace the chain, but don't necessarily see it as a deterrent to purchasing the necklace itself.\nI received eight different colored felt discs to apply essential oil to and insert into the necklace. I personally use the different colors as a color coding system: purple is for my lavender oil, pink for rose, green for lemongrass and so on. These felt discs are thick and hand washable, so if you put too much oil on or want to change it you can. The way this necklace seems to work is that the locket heats up via your own body heat with the skin contact that it makes and that diffuses the scent of the felt pad inside.\nI received this necklace at a discount in return for my fair and honest review. I would gladly purchase this at full price as a gift and would recommend it to anybody who is interested in their own mobile aromatherapy.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm the original owner of a 1997 RAV4 which has been a fabulous car.  Understandably, at this age, the RAV has recently needed some TLC.  I took my dad's advice of saving a lot of $$$ by attempting to do some maintenance myself instead of a shop.  This is the first time I have worked on a car so I bought some tools (tool shopping is totally addicting, btw) and this book.\n\nAt first we debated between the Chilton book and the OEM Toyota shop manual which was twice the $$$.  I was a bit skeptical that the Chilton book could thoroughly cover model years 1996-2002 which is essentially TWO different body styles and THREE different engines (96-97' had the orginal engine, 98-00' was a revised engine and 01-02 was the new body style).  But what the heck, I wanted to save money so I went with the Chilton.\n\nIn the past few months I've done a bunch repairs: idle air control valve, cleaning the throttle body, replaced valve cover gasket, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotors, tested a few sensors, etc....\n\nMy initial gut feeling was right.  Though the book did a great job guiding me on some repairs, I found some instructions and illustrations lacking thoughtfulness.  For example, their illustration states that the coolant hoses attached to the throttle body are the same for years 96-97' and 98-00' but in fact they are slightly different.  This was just one of MANY slight mistakes throughout the book, and it was extremely frustrating especially for a beginner like me.  And many of the instructions were very vague and bordering on incomplete (like the seemingly simple task of removing the valve cover which required me removing way more parts than the instructions stated).  I found myself constantly seeking help from online\nforums (RAV4world.com is great).\n\nI really wished I would've forked up the extra $$$ for the OEM Toyota manual.  My dad has one for his Previa and it is way more complete with better instructions and more illustrations.\n\nThis book might be fine for a seasoned mechanic, but for beginners like me, I would definitely suggest investing in the OEM Toyota manual.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I purchased the Wagner HVLP conversion gun after reading several positive reviews from this site as well as others. In fact, most appear correct. The gun does produce a decent spray pattern and can produce a good finish. Cleaning the gun is also rather easy. Why the low score? Like so many low-priced products coming from overseas targeting the price-obsessed consumer, it suffers from excessive cost cutting.\n\nAn always telling clue is the survivability of the product. After a two foot drop onto the carpet, the gun leaked air. Ok. So, try to tighten the connection. Oops. The handle snapped off like I had been holding a twig. Why did it snap? The plastic handle revealed an extremely thin tube inside. Am I surprised it snapped with such a mild force? No. Am I surprised they decided to cut such corners? Yes. The rest of the product is reasonably well made (though heavy and a little large). Why cut use such a thin tube when the rest of the product appears to be one step up. What's the cost? One dollar? If it couldn't withstand a weekend woodworker, then I don't think it could stand up to any usage. I decided to go with the Apollo 5110 and I'm happy with it's build quality and results.

And since I was replacing the water pump, I might as well replace the timing belt too. Total cost $2000! The book offers several no-cost/low-cost fixes to try first. This book also suggested replacing the valve core, to resolve a slow leak in a tire. I took the tire to two tire repair shops, and neither one suggested that. It might be because the valve cores cost 50 cents, whereas they could sell me another tire for a lot more.

Shipping and packaging was excellent.\n\nManufactured Date of my unit is 31 August 2010. You can find the date by opening up the storage compartment lid, and looking to the raised platform on the right side.  After charging for the recommended 15 hours, I plugged in one 20 inch box fan 120V 60Hz, .075Am. The unit ran for 8 hours of continuous use until the low  battery alarm sounded. Word to the wise, the alarm is quite loud, as it ticked off my GSD enough for him to howl.\n\n Don't know if this is good or bad for this particular unit, but eight hours seems to be a fairly good amount of usage for a normal outage.

{"text": "It's a decent and basic product, for what it is.\n\nYou absolutely must keep the batteries charged, or they will die, never to return.\n\nIf you buy one of these that's been sitting on a shelf too long, you are buying a gigantic paperweight. Not the fault of the product. Blame the retailer.\n\nThe batteries are the business end of the deal here. Replacement batteries are available for $40/pop. If you find one of these dead at a garage sale for $20, you can restore it to new again for $120.\n\nAs many reviewers have stated, if you add more batteries, you get exactly that much more back-up capacity.

{"text": "Once installation was complete, the unit worked perfectly. However, the installation was more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nFirst, the installation instruction referred to a WHITE wire that was to be connected to a bypass module. This part of the instruction was vague in a couple of ways. 1) It did not specify what WHITE wire it was referring to while other areas of the instruction were quite specific (i.e. - BLACK wire with the Blue stripe on the 16-pin harness). 2) It said that the WHITE wire was to be connected to the BLUE wire on the bypass module. However, since there are mutliple different bypass modules available using a variety of color codes, this step created confusion.\n\nSecond, when it came time to connect the various plugs to the starter unit, there was no mention of a need to initialize the unit by stepping on the brake pedal and pressing the start button on the remote. Without this information, when I plugged in the unit, it began a repetitive clicking that would not stop. I had to unplug it and call for Technical Assistance to find out what I was missing.\n\nThird, I found the \"unlimited technical support\" to be somewhat limited. When I ran into the aforementioned problems on a Saturday, I tried calling the 800 number only to find that technical assistance was not available on weekends. So I had to pack it in and wait until after work on Monday. Then when I called on Monday, it took over 30 minutes on hold before I actually had a person on the other end of the line. To his credit, the tech knew exactly what the problem was and I was able to finish the install in short order.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the remote starter, but displeased with the quality of the supplied instructions and the limited availability of the technical support.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is the worst product I have ever bought off Amazon-- the second worst product I have ever bought online. I'm shocked other reviewers haven't reported the issue I had with it:\n\nRight out of the box, I think, \"A quality product, good-- solid handle, a nicely fitted, soft duster attached.\"  I immediately test it on my dry, clean, slightly dusty, black car. I see countless pink particles dusted upon every area of my car touched by this duster. I shake it, and countless more pieces of fiber fall to the floor or float through my garage, depending on the size of the fiber. I think I should wash it and throw it in the dryer (low heat)-- this would get rid of all the extra fibers, dust, thread accumulated during manufacturing. I struggle to pull the extremely tight opening of the duster from its wooden handle; wash it, then clean the steel barrel in the washer, as it's covered with the red fibers of the duster. I think, \"Good. . . got rid of those extra fibers.\" After partially drying on low heat, I remove it and drape it on a chair overnight. The next morning I notice pinkish red dust completely covering the barrel of my dryer, after removing the black clothes my husband had thrown into it earlier. (I had to shake off red particles from the clothes.)  Awkwardly but successfully, I wipe off the pink dust plaguing the inside of my dryer, using a microfiber cloth.\n\nBefore using the duster on my car, I stand outside, on my driveway, shaking the duster. Fibers and dust fly around me, nonstop-- they float upon my driveway and stick to my white shirt. I continue to shake it until not as many fibers fall out. I struggle to get the duster back onto its handle, but can get the last corner completely in, but it is fairly secure. I dust my car with it-- only a couple of strokes over the rear window-- and see the same tiny red particles I saw before I went through the above process.\n\nThe box it came in has already gone off to be recycled, and its not worth the money or effort to return this evil conglomeration of fibers;\nhowever  I'm spending something more precious than money, my time, writing this review to warn other people.", "label": 0}

I brought this for a couple day power outage at home, to run my sump, refrigerator, and hopefully furnace/blower. But, Modified sine wave is more like a modified square wave. I tested it with a fan, and as some warned the fan ran \"noisy\".  I am afraid to use it with my new furnace, as I don't want to damage the control boards with the screwy AC waveform.  So I'm considering getting a small pure sine wave unit to drive my furnace controls, separately power the blower with this MSW unit.  I think the sump will be fine, the refrig I haven't tried yet.  I also had to buy an expensive Deep Cycle battery.\n\nUpdate Nov 2013:  Here is a description of the 'modified sine wave' I observed with my oscilloscope. It is NOTHING AT ALL like a sine wave. It is a rectangular waveform, with one pulse per half-period. There is no approximation of a sinewave's shape with graduated 'steps'.. The voltage and width of the output pulse varies with the load. The peak-peak voltage of normal 120 Vac is about 344. When running a lightbulb the MSW pulse was 320 Vp-p, the pulse-width was about 4 millisec. Adding a small fan to the load lowered Vp-p to 310 and PW widened to ~5.8 ms. I imagine as the load goes up, peak voltage drops and pw widens to deliver 'same' power.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Pros: None.  It did not work out of the box.\nCons: Fan is \"way\" too loud like other reviewers have stated (I thought the people reviewing it were being picky).  It is always on, unlike the \"Xantrex Technologies XPower Plus 400-Watt Inverter #851-0400\" which only turns on at 100 Watt draw.  Also it plain old just didn't work right out of the package.  It would turn on until I plugged the test devices in (a  EEE PC and a small jigsaw,again both plugged in one at a time, never at the same time) once plugged in the power started then cut out,then started,then cut out with only 1 second between each flux. The worst part is that I ordered a second one for my father because he saw mine and wanted one, unfortunately I did not test the one I received prior to ordering the second one. Now I need to deal with getting a refund for an open item and shipping an unopened inverter back.  I tested it on 2 cars and one  car is only 2 weeks old with 700 miles on it (can't be the wiring or battery). I am currently now in the process of returning this and possible picking up the Xantrex 400 Watt.\nI had low expectations for this unit and they didn't even meet those.  I would recommend to stay away from Jensen inverters.", "label": 0}

{"text": "While looking for a more natural solution to the common cold and headaches, I decided to add essential oils into my life. There are so many ways to use essential oils, one of which is through a diffuser, so of course I had to get one! This is the 2nd type of diffuser I am trying out, and there are some notable differences.\n\n1. This diffuser has a timer on it!! FANTASTIC! These smaller ones will only go for so long on one fill, and if you aren't paying attention and the well dries up, that's not good for the diffuser. This one has a built in timer function for 30/60/120/180 minutes. Perfect for the bedside option.\n\n2. There is only 1 LED option, and it's clear. No color changes like some of the others out there. With this one you have 2 options, on and off. Not a big deal, just takes some of the esthetic appeal away.\n\n3. While I can see the diffused mist drifting out the top, it is not a very powerful stream like the other one I have. I'm still not sure if this means it is less powerful or not, time will tell. But I liked being able to see the steady stream of mist, and this one is very light.\n\n4. This one isn't very pretty. There's really no \"design\" to it, just your basic plastic and with a white light. Again, not a big deal, it doesn't effect how the diffuser works, just not as nice to look at as others. This one will most likely become our bedroom diffuser so no one but us sees it.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with it for the base purpose of diffusing whatever oil I want to use at the time. I think there could be some basic changes to the design to make it more appealing, but if you are just looking for your basic diffuser with a timer function, this is perfect.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I pre-ordered the Haynes manual for the liquid-cooled BMW twins some weeks ago. Amazon delivered it today.\n\nI've been buying Chilton, Clymer, and Haynes manuals for decades. They bring a DIY perspective to working on one's bike, in contrast to the we-assume-you-already-know-most-of-the-issues-and-gotchas-with-each-service-task-so-we're-not-going-to-mention-them perspective that the official service manuals typically offer.\n\nWith that as the backdrop... the production quality of this latest Haynes manual is the worst I've yet seen. Small, low-resolution black and white photos. And the paper stock is that real cheap pulp stuff. Those of you familiar with the numerous Gun Digest tomes will know instantly what I'm talking about.\n\nThe most important thing, of course, is the accuracy of the information and whether it effectively leads a DIY owner to perform safe, comprehensive, and accurate service work. I haven't spent enough time with the book to really comment on that. I did look quickly at a couple of service tasks - oil change and adjusting valves - and they seem reasonably complete. And Haynes rates each service task with degree-of-difficulty, so that's a nice touch.\n\nBut the whole book is handicapped by the small, low-res pictures, and those are then made even worse by the really awful paper stock.\n\nOther than reference-type data, like torque settings, most of us refer to a manual because we're not entirely sure how to perform a task. Or maybe we just need a reminder because it's been awhile. A good manual will combine good text with great pictures to illuminate exactly what is needed. This one seems to have pretty good text. But the other half, the photos, really suck. The difference between what you squint at here, trying to understand what is going on, and Jim Bade's wethead video ([...]), is profound.\n\nSo with that said, yeah, I'm disappointed in the book. I'd probably still have bought it, knowing it was done on the cheap, simply because I'm one of those guys who believes you can't have too many windows shining light on a task. But it's too bad Haynes didn't take the opportunity to make this the really solid effort it could have been.

{"text": "The Yamika BOA roof rack seemed like the best deal for a bike rack on amazon.com.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the way the fork mount held the bike in place. It is a tension fit only, there is not grooves or anything to grip on to the fork ends, just flat metal on flat metal. I will probably grab some small specialty washers for something to bite on because I really don't want to buy new bikes or fix someones bumper when they fly off. The rear mount is a little quirky and looks very easy to steal even with a lock. My bike is a simple road bike with 700c-23 tires on it and it is a very loose fit in the rear strap system. I will have to get some rubber or foam on there to get more pressure on the tire. I have square bars so I probably won't have the problem of my bike tires slipping down and hitting the roof of the car like a few others were having.\n\nI was most upset with the item description. It is not a new model of this item and it is NOT the one in the picture although they are the same price. It looks similar but there were a few great improvements for the new model year in the picture.\nMost noticeable is the skewer is a bolt and a threaded locknut is on the other side of the fork to keep pressure more even and to give it more bite instead of the flat surfaces of the old model. The old model I was sold does not have this nut and is instead a bolt that threads into the skewer lever, it is a PITA to adjust because the weight of the bike sits on it.\n\nOther than that it really is a decent, cheap, easily installed bike rack. Be sure to measure your bike if you have round bars, we don't want your paint getting jazzed up. I plan to use a cable bike lock to secure my bike to the rack which does lock well.", "label": 0}

{"text": "First I have NOT bought these exact jumper cables, however there seem to be a lot of these foreign (China) type cables around and most are NOT 100 % copper !! They are copper clad aluminum (CCA). I have ordered many other sets, thinking it was the deal of the century (about $75 each set), only to find out that these cables \"spec listing\" are usually somewhat incorrect. (mostly related to the copper content)...... You should be leery about purchasing any jumper cables (or any wire for that matter), that states the wire is copper clad aluminum, copper coated aluminum or hybrid copper wire.... More and more companies are using these type of cost cutting procedures to fool you into thinking it's the identical product. (companies are doing this due to the soaring price of copper). Unfortunately, the trouble starts when manufactures don't tell you what type of wire they're using, or worse yet they list that their wire is 100% copper and it's NOT !.... (I'm sure some people were not even aware that this ridiculousness was going on)\n\nIn case you would like to know more about these types of jumper cables, I have some info on them, due to the fact that I actually had a lot them in my possession for awhile ( I returned them).\nThe cables are about 9/16 inches thick (outside measurement, includes insulation). The insulation is about 1/8 inch thick. There seems to be a slight air gap between the cable and its insulation. The bare cable does appear to be 1 gauge (0.2893), for the regular person that's a little less than 5/16 of an inch.\nThe length of the each cable is about 24 feet 4 inches (without the clamps). Some have 2 separate cables in the set... In other words, these cables are not joined together, like most regular jumper cables are. Each cable clamp weights about 10.15 oz (with rubber boots on)..... The cables have an eye lug that's crimped on each end, and these bolt (nut & bolt) or rivet on to each clamp.\n\nThe clamps, eye lugs, nuts & bolts are STEEL. They may look copper but a magnet sticks quite well to them (copper is not magnetic), proving that its just a cheap thin copper coating... Which, when the jumper cables are used, this coating can wear right off.... Leaving just the steel to make the connection to the battery...... Steel is NOT the best of electrical conductors.\n\nNow, in case your wondering, I could only find 3 basic ways to tell if a wire is copper clad aluminum or 100% copper.\n1) scrape test\n2) weight test\n3) burn test\n\nI only preformed 2 of the 3 test on these types of jumper cables (because doing the burn test, makes returning them difficult). First the scrape test..... I scrape the cables right near where the cable is crimped to the eye lug, sure enough the silver color aluminum comes right through (just use a knife or razor blade).... (If it was pure copper, it's copper color would go all the way through)\n\nNow the weight test, these cables average weight (without clamps) at about 9 lbs 8 1/2 oz. (however, this does include the cable insulation and the steel eye lugs)....First you should subtract the weight of the insulation and steel eye lugs to get to the BARE wire weight.....no where could I find a weight for this - - - so the only other real option to get that weight figure was to call the manufacturer, but most of those same manufactures are the ones claiming this wire to be 100% copper, so what do you think the chances of getting an honest answer from them would be ?.... So I will subtract off 1 lb 8 1/2 oz (I believe its a conservative guess).... Leaving us a bare wire weight at about 8 lbs........ (Now compare that weight to the equivalent in copper wire)....Take two bare, one gauge 100 % copper wires 24.375 feet long each (same length as these cables)(total combine length 48.75 feet)...that weighs 12.35 lbs....... So, we have their cables at 8 lbs compared to 100 % copper cables at 12 .35 lbs....... That means these types of jumper cables don't pass that test either !\n\nFor the burn test (usually done on thin gauge wire) you hold a lighter or torch to the wire in question and if the wire burns off fast or kinda drips off rather quick, its aluminum or if only some of the wire drips off and some wire is left, then its usually some type of mix of copper and aluminum ..... (aluminum melts much faster). (I did not preform this test)\n\nNow you should also be aware that Chinese (plus other foreign countries) wire gauge can be off from ours.... There 1 gauge wire can be about a 3 gauge wire in USA ......... It seems they either don't have a standard or just don't follow any !..........Now, that was NOT the case in the different ones that I tested , but just to make you aware that's its definitely something else to look for !\n\nSo do I think these cables are terrible......no not really, (they might be better than some real cheap or even mid range jumper cable sets). Most do come in a plastic case, (which seemed \"OK\") that's better than nothing or those bags that some jumper cables come with .......They're just usually not as advertised (100 % copper wire greatly out preforms cheaper hidden core aluminum wires)...... and it would seem that they're trying to hide this and/or make it confusing and misleading to the average person trying to get a PREMIUM set of jumper cables. No one should support any company that stoops to this kind of business practices ! For those reasons, and some of the unknown, about copper coated aluminum cables durability (the actual bending back and forth of aluminum wire, especially in cold weather). I would prefer not to be the guinea pig in this area !.... So I sent them back for a full refund and will NOT recommend them to you......... I always try to look out for the little guy, and for the most part that's you (and me) !! ........\n\nOh, in case you were wondering what jumper cables I ended up with, they were \"Bayco SL-3010\" and they sell them right here on amazon. But I got them online from O\"Reilly auto parts for 111 bucks, (they passed all the test's) ........... (Bobster's Garage)", "label": 0}

{"text": "This oil pan is a fantastic concept: drain the oil, cap it, and transport it. If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.\n\nI read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.\n\nI made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.\n\nThe drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.\n\nThe smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.\n\nThe saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the \"drain, cap and transport\" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.\n\nIt's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case. I hope there's some other manufacturer who can do a better version, and I'm willing to pay a little more for this concept well executed. It's a shame.", "label": 0}

(not as powerful as a full size, but we expected that). Works great with debris and hairs. The only thing I don't like is the long tube attachment, because it gonna make the suction weak. But other attachments are very useful . The little brush on the end that helps dislodge sticky hairs.  The crevice attachment works well for debris and crackers under the seats, and easily clean into corners and hard to reach edges. Those two parts meet all my needs. Cleaning the vacuum is pretty easy too. Just take out filter, and clean it with water. The manufactory is very thoughtful, they give an extra filter as backup. Overall, it's nice vacuum for the reasonable price. I would recommend this product to anyone whom like something small to keep in your vehicle.", "label": 1}

This vacuum is a \"dust buster\" for those who are familiar with it. Therefore, it does not have the same powerful suction as an actual vacuum cleaner. That being said, it can clean up your vehicle well. The power cord is long enough to easily reach every inch of my Dodge Grand Caravan minivan. If you do have difficulty reaching there is an extension hose you can connect. The vacuum comes with two different adapter tips to help clean in hard to reach areas. My favorite adapter is the brush, because it can pick up more than the suction alone. When you are finished using the vacuum you can press the button on top that releases the large end piece with the filter. Pull the filter out and you are able to discard the contents. Since this comes with a carrying case you can keep everything together and in your vehicle.\n\nOverall, it performs as advertised and I am pleased with it's cleaning ability. I do wish there was more suction to clean more quickly and to remove pet hair easier. The suction alone hasn't been able to remove my dog's hair in the upholstery. When I add the brush attachment the brush pulls the hair out of the upholstery, but it remains in the bristles. Thanks for watching!\n\nGiven sample to test and return my personal honest opinion. I create videos to demonstrate that I have tested the product and have made no false statements.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Long on looks but short on durability and quality of material.  With use, it becomes more and more difficult to get a good seal between the guage and your valve stem because: (1) the outer rubber sleeve on the tip of the guage tends to slide when you press the guage against the valve stem of your tires; and (2) the actual piece of the guage that makes contact with the center of your valve stem is made of plastic, not metal, and it wears out rather quickly.  The result is that my guage does not even work due to worn parts after only one year of moderate use.  Although now useless, the guage looks so nice I still have not thrown it away.

{"text": "This is a great concept, and I really wanted to love it, in fact I still have it on my subaru with my Copperhead Fork mounts just incase I can figure a better way of using it. . . That being said. The first time on the road with this tire mount, I was going down the highway around 70 mph and heard a loud thud on my roof. Scared part of the rack ripped off, I exited the highway to see if there was any damage. No damage, but no tire upright anymore either. The mount had shifted over and landed on the roof, still attached, but rubbing the roof... I tried what others have said and added some electrical tape under the mount before using it so it does \"turn\", and I tightened the nuts till they seemed too tight. The problem still existed. With the weight of my 29er MTB X-Country bike tire, it simply can not live up to it's need. Fortunately I have another bike with a 700cc road tire that weighs 1/3rd, almost 1/4th, compared to my 29er. The rack should work for it, but I'm still nervous to bring it back on the highway, under 50mph with the road bike tire is OK. Over 50 is yet to be deteremined. Under 45mph with a 29er seemed to be fine, but I was on the highway for no more than 2 - 3 miles before having to exit! So buyer beware. Also - there is no lock, no SkS Lock, notta. A simple wrench could steal the mount off with your tire. So take it with you for the night when traveling, or lock it in your vehical after. On a nice note, it does lay nice and flat while not in use, and match my yakima rack and rail system beautifully. . .", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is a nifty little product...for some people. It does what it is supposed to do, but buyers need to be very aware of it's limitations or they will be returning it like I did. First of all, Amazon lists the working range of this unit as .5 to 16 feet. However, the instructions in the box indicate that you should have at least 18 inches in front of the device to work with, with three open feet on each side. I tried parking a car within about 9 inches of the sensor and reset the range per the instructions. When driving up to the unit it gave me a red light to stop at around 16-18 inches...with about 6 inches of car hanging out of the garage! I thought maybe the calibration was off, so I brought the car to within a few inches of the sensors, reset the range, and lo and behold the red light came on at 16-18 inches again. This device is useless in close quarters.\n\nThe second issue has to do with many cars having curved front bumpers (like our Quest mini-van). Because of this it's important that you have at least 6-10 inches of \"play\" in your garage or you might find that one day you don't line up correctly with your curved bumper and leave the rear of the car in the way of the door again. Combine those two factors and you will need to make sure you have at least a significant amount of room to work with. It will not be effective in tight quarters.", "label": 2}

I prefer using a diffuser necklace to rubbing the oil on my temples or forehead. I've had problems with my eyes watering with the peppermint so close to them.

The material used for the pendant necklace is 316L surgical grade stainless steel, it is the highest quality of stainless steel in the market. It would absolutely guarantee a lifetime! The stainless steel is much better than silver. It maintains its lustre, not dulling and tarnishing like silver does.\n\n4. The pendant has magnetic closure and it closes very well,you can never worry about the oil pad dropping out once you close it. The pendant closes firmly and stays closed. Because of the magnetic closure, there are no clasps to bend, wear out or break.\n\n5. The pads are washable so you can clean them and use another type of oil in them.

I wish it would last longer.\n\nI tried it on my turn signals which have yellowed really bad, and it doesn't seem to work at all on them for some reason.\n\nIn my experience on a scale of 1-5, 5 being like new, it does maybe 3.5 for clearing it up. I averaged it down to 3 stars for the yellowing coming back within weeks.", "label": 2}
{"text": "So, I bought a 1988 Chevy Van thinking I would make a road trip from San Francisco to Portland in it. Alas, my $800 road trip van had some problems. Brake warning light on all the time, oil pressure gauge that jumped all over when I drove it. Anyway, I decided I would \"fix\" that van myself, so I bought this book. Being prone to long nights drinking and carousing in San Francisco and a procrastinator by nature, the van repair got put off for a bit. One sober day I decided to man up and start fixing the van. But where was the manual?\n\nHum! I looked high and low, and checked on Amazon to make sure I had actually bought it, which I had,  but I could not fine it anywhere. So I ask my girlfriend \"Hey, have you seem my Chilton manual for that van I bought?\" Her response was to point at a old bookcase in the corner of the hallway. \"Its there with my bibles and wedding planning books\" she said.\n\nHum, sounds like I am being set up. The problem is that this particular bookcase is right next to our super sized, four cat litter box. Being ignorant about littler box things, I stomped right over and, seeing my Chilton manual's spine, pulled it from the bookcase.\n\nWell, as you probably guessed, the manual was not in it's original condition. It was somewhat damp, well actually, soaked with cat urine. It fell apart in my now urine soaked hands. If this was a movie, we would cut to a scene showing my girlfriend is cackling in the living room.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that I have no idea if this manual is useful for GM Vans produced from 1987-1997. I sold the van soon afterwards and never gave it another thought. But my experience with other Chilton repair manuals had been very positive, so I guess this one would be good as well.", "label": 1}

I ordered this unit to run a small blower, a small refrigerator and some small appliance chargers (phones, iPad, etc). It worked great for less than a year. Ran large cable (00-gauge) through my truck and had it done right. After a short while, it suddenly stopped providing power. The LEDs on the side lit up and appeared normal, but no power would be provided at the outlets; the manual only gave options for troubleshooting when the LEDs didn't come on. The wiring in the truck checked out and a separate power supply confirmed the issue was with the inverter.\n\nContacted the manufacturer and could not resolve the situation. Now I'm out of pocket over $250 and have to find another inverter. For the price, I expected much better. Zero reason an inverter would last under a year. Looking at other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one to experience this malfunction. I recommend trying another brand.", "label": 0}

The inverter has a annoying alarm when the battery gets to low. You can run a microwave for about 10 minutes and then you have to recharge again . Recharge time 8hours using the  car and 12 hours using the house. So as far as back up power I would not want to be caught with this power pack  in a power outage, unless you just plan on watching t.v. or charging you cell phone and no usb either. 2 stars", "label": 0}

{"text": "Im really pleased with these little felt discs. Theyve been packaged in a nice, resealable plastic pouch, where Ill be able to store them easily for future use. There are 11 of them, each one a different color. The pink disc is a little more vibrant than the one that came with my necklace, and I like it the better for it.\n\nThe main difference Im happy about, however, is the fact that these discs are just a little bit bigger than the original ones. With those, I found that the discs were a little too small for the recess in the pendant. It was a small thing, but it was still annoying. It wasn't very noticeable when the pendant was closed, but it was a little, if one were to look closely. These still don't fit perfectly, and are a little on the small side, but they're definitely an improvement over the ones that came with the pendant.\n\nThey hold the smell applied to them for ages, which is the same as the original pads. They work really well to carry about the smell of essential oils, as well as perfume, which is another use I put these to.\n\nIm happy to have more than the three different colors, and all of them so vibrant! They show up well through the slots of the diffuser pendant, and make it easier to match what Im wearing. They have a smoother edge than the original discs as well. I don't know if that is better or not, just different. The original ones looked as if the round edge was melted during the cutting process, while these do not have that same look or feel. Maybe that is why they are a little bigger? Whatever the case, I love them!\n\nI received these  diffuser pads at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "label": 1}

By redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable. I bought this for our new Ridgid WD1680, which Amazon doesn't sell. The big box store I bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so I got this to go with it. Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it. The WD1680 also works as a removeable blower. In that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port, even though it was the same port with just a tube attachment.

That should have given my a clue.  The remote had lost it's program so i went to the website for some troubleshooting.  I followed the steps to the T and got remote reprogrammed.  It worked like a charm.  A few hours later i used the remote and the truck started just perfectly.  Three or four minutes later I went to get inside and head to McDonalds but the truck had already shut off.  I thought that was odd because i have heard of other starters letting the vehicle run for at least 15 minutes.  Oh well though I figured I'd just start it with my key and head out.  With a turn of the key...nothing, just a click.  So i pulled my wife's HUMMER up beside my ranger and tried to jump it off.  Nothing but clicks.  So i hooked up my battery charger and jumped in my van and went for dinner.

When I read how poor the service is with Black and Decker I am scared to use this unit.  But what should I expect from a company that send its manufactering over to China and not keep it here in the U.S of A.  I believe that if I had it to do all over again, I am not sure if I would buy the VEC1093.  Not because of the design of the electronic's, because of the design of the body.", "label": 2}

It slipped off after that, and I never saw it again.\nFinding a really good EDC keychain pen is a major hassle. I'm trying one I found on Kickstarter, which will be hit or miss.

And I call it my toy because it is just so much fun to use! This one vacuum has:\n\n1) DRY VAC for cleaning up dirt and spills tracked into the car.\n\n2) WET VAC for cleaning up any spills in a quick hurry!\n\n3) BRUSH ATTACHMENT to comb the carpet or brush the upholstery.\n\n4) INFLATION TIPS -- ball needle, air mattress, etc.\n\n5) TIRE PUMP to inflate flat tires with built-in tire pressure gauge on the rear of the vacuum\n\n6) LIGHT built-in to the vacuum for added convenience\n\n7) EXTENSION HOSE for those hard to reach places\n\n8) CARRYING CASE\n\nIt is so easy to plug the vacuum into the charging port of the car and clean up any mess that may be in the car or inflate my kid's flat soccer ball or even top off my tires when needed. There isn't anything that this compact vacuum can't do! And when I'm done having my fun, all I have to do is pack it back up into its compact storage bag and slide it up under the seat...it's so compact it is impossible to even tell that it is there!\n\nThe biggest surprises for me were 1) that it was strong enough to actually inflate the tires of my large SUV and 2) that the vacuum had enough suction to remove pet hair from the carpet!\n\nThe biggest surprise for my friends is when a ball needs to be inflated at soccer practice and I pull out a vacuum and proceed to inflate balls in a matter of seconds. The shock and awe is too funny...then it immediately turns into \"where did you get that???\"\n\nThis vacuum has been a huge hit!! I LOVE it and all of my friends who have seen it have really been taken with it. It's so easy to have fun with this multi-tool :)\n__________\n\nWas this review helpful to you?

You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is.\n- Lacks discussion on common problems encountered during repairs.

Often, when this happens, Haynes releases a completely new manual for the new model (e.g. 2010+) instead of just slapping the entire run of the car together. I took a chance and ordered the guide.\n\nHaynes impressed me once again - this book deftly describes the differences between the 2010+ model of the 3 and the 2004-2009 model; it truly covers both series of the Mazda 3.\n\nIt's worth noting that another user mentioned the book doesn't cover the Mazdaspeed version of the 3.

{"text": "I recently got tired of messing around with my old mechanical analog tire gauge and decided to go digital.  After searching on Amazon, I found two digital gauges that looked good:  the Accutire MS-4000B and the Campbell-Hauschild AU1102.  They both sounded good, although I was a little troubled by some of the reviews of the Accutire.  I decided, since we have two cars, to get one of each, so I could keep one in each car.  I have now experienced a couple of weeks of use, during which I have had the opportunity to employ a tire gauge more than usual due to \"operator learning curve\" problems associated with setting up the on-board tire pressure sensor in a new Toyota.  (How do those things work, anyway?)  The bottom line is:  get the Campbell-Hauschild.\n\nThe Accutire looks cool and comes in a nice case.  It has a convenient pocket clip.  But doesn't work all that great measuring the air pressure in your tires.  I experienced the sealing problem reported by others.  It's not that big a thing, but you do loose a little air every time you take a reading.  I will try the rubber tape suggestion made by another reviewer, but the C-H seals perfectly right out of the box.  The Accutire reads a pound lower than the C-H and my old analog gauge.  Maybe the other two are the ones that are \"off,\" but . . .  On several occasions, the Accutire did not give a reading - just displayed \"0.0\"  The C-H always sealed completely and gave a believable reading.  The Accutire is easy to use, all you have to do is push it against the valve stem and it turns on and gives a reading.  The C-H has to be turned on with a button before pressing against the valve stem.  The C-H has a tread gauge that also serves to depress the valve; the Accutire doesn't have any kind of nipple or anything to let air out of the tire if it is over-inflated.  With the experience gained using these, at this point I would buy the C-H rather than the Accutire.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Well, I am surprised.  Completely and totally and pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.\n\nHere's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.\n\nIt did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  It comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.", "label": 1}

The pendant is heavy, and it is fairly large, but I think I like it that way. However, if you are looking for something small and discrete, this won't be a good pendant for you. It is definitely a statement piece. The included pads are thick and absorb a lot of oil.

The rust is purely aesthetic though as the hitch works just fine.\n\nNote that if you live in an area where crime is high, it is easy for something to steal the interchangeable ball if left on the hitch (has not happened to me, but would be possible). With a trailer attached it's firmly secured though.\n\nDefinitely worth buying if you intend to use different trailer hitch sizes!\n\nEDIT:  Not very long after using it I ran into the same problem most people have; the ball gets stuck and can't be changed.  The problem is rusting of the small ball bearings.  I found that soaking the entire piece in concentrated CLR (or something fairly strongly acidic) loosened things up enough that a few strong whacks from a hammer freed the ball.  Scrubbing the exposed ball bearings with CLR helped quite a bit.  After I rinsed everything with water I sprayed it with a good deal of WD-40 and added a few drops of 3-in-1 oil to each ball bearing.  Seems to be working much better now!", "label": 2}

It bottoms out in the plastic housing, so when pushed in it can easily lose contact intermittently, then get it back. Not good for use in a car. I modified the contact so it behaved more like better CLAs and things improved considerably but there were still random losses of power.\n\nI continued to play around with it using a 12V DC brick that had has a CLA socket as it's output. I could not reproduce the problem when everything is sitting still. The connections I made to connect the coby to the camera seem solid and work just fine in the car using a remote battery pack instead of the coby. I am still unsure what is wrong with it, perhaps I was unable to improve the center contact enough or there is something inside that doesn't like the vibrations of driving. It works nice sitting still at home plugged into the brick, just won't work that well in a moving car.\n\nIf I decide to go further I'll probably modify it by wiring it to one of my better CLAs. This will eliminate the CLA part of it from use and I'll find out if it's just a mechanical contact issue or something in the underlying electronics.", "label": 0}

Sadly I don't have any on hand so I am subbing it with a Meguires car wash solution in cold water. Theoretically it should be fine since this soap does not strip the waxes, finish, or sealants on a clear. I will follow up on its performace as soon as I finish rinsing it out and placing out to dry. I plan to keep it out of directs sunlight as well. As precaution I will allow it 36 hours before I check it again.\n\n(Follow up)", "label": 2}

{"text": "This integrated unit looked so good and so convenient that I bought two of them. Bad move. Like all batteries, they are doomed to weaken after about 3 years -- they don't hold much charge any more, and they're virtually impossible to replace. Now one of my units has an inverter that instantly goes to \"Failure\" when I when I switch it on, even with no load and a fully charged battery pack. I'll be junking the whole thing soon.\n\nMuch better is to buy individual AGM 35AH batteries (for example) and a stand-alone inverter. That way, when something fails, it can be replaced. And while one battery is being used, another can be re-charging. Separate components are a much more sensible and flexible way to go.\n\nThe shipping charge alone to return this turkey for repair can buy a nice fresh battery.  Phooey. This is the first negative review I've ever written on Amazon, but this product earned it.\n\nUPDATE: July 14, 2014: Local \"authorized service center\" replied to my inquiry about repairs with this one-liner: \"I regret to inform you the Xpower power pack 1500 is not serviceable.\" Really. Wow.\n\nThe unit is only 3 years old and now worthless as an AC power source. Batteries still seem to have some life in them, so I can power an external inverter, but when they go, I'm done. Big waste of money on this turkey. Shame on Xantrex for not producing a serviceable product and then not standing behind it. I would recommend that Amazon simply stop selling it.\n\nI repeat my earlier recommendation: Buy a hefty battery, some thick power cables, and a standalone inverter. Make a wheeled cart for it if you want to. At least then you can service the thing yourself.\n\nNote also: If you plan to power a refrigerator or other device that needs a lot of surge power to get the motor running, make sure the inverter can handle it ... read reviews from those who've bought it ... even for a small refrigerator, I needed one with over 2000 watts continuous power rating.

{"text": "This diffuser necklace is perfect for wearing your favorite scents! I LOVE wearing spearmint, lime and stress away essential oils. IT's my \"happy\" scent! The diffuser part is pretty big, about the size of a 50 cent piece. But it is really light. It's not heavy at all like I thought it might be.\nThe picture shows 3 felt pieces that come with the necklace. I got a total of 5! The 3 pictured are thicker, heavier felt. The two additional ones that I got are thinner - standard thickness I would say. The colors pictured are accurate - black, white and a pretty light pink. The additional ones are purple and tan. I like having the extra options and colors. The locket it a pretty, shiny silver and can be work with just about anything.\nI only tested this using therapeutic grade essential oils, I did not try actual perfumes or body sprays - I don't own any. Being that I am used to essential oils, I added about 3 drops, depending on the blend that I was using. The scent lasted all day! I would get a whiff throughout the day just by my normal body movements. If it was a particularly stressful day and I was wearing Stress Away I would hold it up to my nose as needed and take some deep breaths to help melt away the stressful feeling.\nThe chain is a little too long for my liking. The diffuser part sits right at breast level. Some like them long, I prefer a little shorter.\nMake sure to take out the felt pads when you're not using, it will help to keep the necklace from tarnishing. I just clean the necklace with a drop of lemon essential oil if needed.\nOverall I really enjoy this necklace, I plan on getting one for my daughter to wear to school to help her stay focused and I think this will work just fine.\nI did receive this item free or at a discount in return for an honest review.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I've used Fram oil filters the better part of 40 years and in the olden days they were top quality and used in industry. Today Fram doesn't even make filters, they're contracted out and you know what that means. If you read various blogs, reviews and reports about dissected oil filters of all makes Fram is the one to stay clear of. Just recently I had personal experience with a PH8A Fram Extra Guard with 1,021 miles on it. The engine bearings were making \"loose\" noises on startup in the morning. It seems that anti-drainback valve failure is a common problem with these and also plugging to the point that the pressure relief valve opens and allows unfiltered oil through the engine. There have been reports of the filter media detaching and plugging the oil passage completely so there's no lubrication at all. Take it with a grain of salt but you really ought to read the reviews and comments of others that have had problems with Fram filters. One of the top replies to questions about engine noises is \"are you using a Fram filter?\" I will say one good thing about it, it kept the oil very clean for 1k miles but that filter was very heavy when I removed it and possibly bypassing so be aware.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Let me get to the point, All the positive reviews about this duster are correct! I've had this duster for a couple of weeks, used it on three cars, and it absolutely works wonders. It completely removes the dust on cars and leaves the car looking just like it has been washed. The duster's bristle is soft and thick, doesn't scratch, the paraffin wax helps catch dust, and the duster is large enough to easily clean surfaces. Using the duster is also as simple as it gets, you just swipe the duster over your car, no need to scrub or even rub. It's that simple! I haven't had any problem with the duster leaving wax streaks because I left it on newspaper to air out for 48 hrs per instructions. The dusters instruction also mentioned that there is no need to wash the duster, \"that the dustier it gets the better it cleans\". And from my experience that seems completely accurate. Of course it also states, if you feel the need to wash the duster do so by hand washing it. The duster also comes with its own case, so there is no need to worry about hanging it out in the open. I've been using the duster once every week and it leaves my car looking as if I just washed it. I absolutely love this car duster and would completely recommend it to everyone.\n\nUpdate***\nAfter carefully examining my car after numerous uses with this duster, I have to admit I am very disappointed by one aspect of this item. The duster won't scratch the car but it will leave SWIRL Marks! I noticed very bad swirl marks on my and went through an extensive test to try figure out what was causing the swirls. I had though it was my Micro fiber cleaning sponge and towels, but after examining everything, and then testing out the duster my conclusion was it was coming from the duster. As a dusting product it is great, but completely horrible if you are trying to maintain a show car finish on your vehicle.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Its good, but there's better products.  I finally got around to using this on a 2006 WW 26ft toyhaluer.  If you're expecting a quick easy job, then do it yourself polishing is not for you.  I've been detailing for many years, so this isn't my first rodeo. Like \"Customer Ed\" said, this is a machine job, not an orbital or hand job.  You need a quality polisher, and good wool pads based on your situation, and the time to be patient.  I use a Makita 9227C 7-Inch Hook and Loop Polisher/Sander for the better part of 10 years now - great machine.\n\nFirst Meguiars #49 Oxidation Remover will remove most of the oxidation in one pass after you've spread it out and polished till the compound is no longer hazy, provided you've put enough on and spread evenly around and worked small areas like 2x2ft.  However, this will not get 100% out, but does leave a glossy surface - depending on your color, amount of oxidation, etc.  In my case, working on white gel coat, you could see there was still some haziness left after using this product.  Pictures 2,4,5 show some of the hazy areas (not compound residue) left over after using the #49  (the day is completely overcast, so the clouds you're seeing are areas that didn't polish out 100% with the Meguiar's)  I switched over to a 3M Imperial compound and had much better results, 3M spreads better, cuts through the oxidation in one pass leaving no haze behind like the Meguiars did.  The abrasives dissipate fast and you'll be hard pressed to burn through the coat or decal unless you're really trying.  To be fair, #49 didn't have any burn issues either, but I had to use much more material as it didn't spread out very well.  I had the 3M stuff left over from my days working in a fiberglass boat factory.  I would highly recommend a 3M product over this - yes you'll spend more money on it, but doing the work once with quality results is what you want when polishing a large boat/RV.\n\n#45 High Gloss Polish made a negligible difference as the second step in this 3 step process.  Didn't remove any haziness left behind by the #49.  Bottle states that \"Special formula restores vital oils\".  I'm no scientist, so I can't really comment on that.  But the bottle also states \"Especially effective on dark colors\", since I was working on white, could explain why I didn't get much affect from this.\n\n#56 Wax goes on pretty good.  I used a orbital buffer to apply it and microfiber hand work to take it off.  Don't go too thick and it will come off easier once dry, if you go to thick in one area, just come back to it shortly after and reapply to level it out before removal.\n\nI did the front of the trailer about 1.5 years ago and its been rewaxed a couple times since.  The haziness I spoke of earlier is coming back, and more noticeable; I will redo the front polishing with the 3M Marine Compound and Finishing Material.  The wax has done a decent job protecting the front surface though, but will probably look to another wax once this bottle runs out.  Also the #49 did not last the whole job on a 26ft toyhauler, I got about 2/3rds complete before switching to the 3M compound I had left over from my marine industry days.", "label": 2}

Only the wimpy performance of this unit keeps the temperature relatively stable.\n* The power connector is really easy to get backwards: more than once we've destroyed our food (if you get it backwards the unit heats).\n* The unit sucks our car battery dry in about an hour.\n* We bought a 3rd party AC adapter for nighttime use: it is smaller, less expensive, and more compact than the Koolatron equivalent.\n* The unit is very cheaply made, and while replacement parts are available they are priced far too high.  The fan cover is particularly flimsy.\n* The fan vents the \"wrong way\".  Hot air wants to rise, on this model it tries tries to blow hot air down.\n\nFor occasional use this unit is OK.  But if you're on the road a lot, consider investing in a well made \"compressor\" based cooler.  It will run longer, get cooler, keep a more steady temperature, and generally be far better.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I read this review, ignored it, bought these anyways, and hate them! I rather use my cheapy alligator Target specials than these. That is saying something from someone who used to jump start cars/trucks/semis for a living (worked close to a freeway offramp). The clamps are absolutely horrid and the uneven jaws cause these to move a bit sideways from their \"spinning\" to a stop, if you will, on a short post. These do not place well on both my Optima batteries' posts. When a car won't jump, we can't help but wonder if it is the battery (Mustangs and their dead batteries, you know...) or these cables, so we keep trying to reseat them on the post better, until we can attain a jump. So after the umpteenth time of frustration with these, I am back here at Amazon searching for something better. Slim pickings too. Just basically Colemans.

Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters. My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor, rotor, wires and plugs. According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been.

This will wind up weighing 200+ pounds, and it is NOT \"portable\"...I repeat it is NOT portable unless you have a pet pack mule...\n\n...this Xantrex-on-wheels is for brewing coffee in the morning, not powering useful devices for hours during a blackout...\n\n***** Did You Get That? *****\n\nThe original review follows---\n\nContinuous power rating is 1350W, not 1500W.  Most units have 3x17Ah=51Ah, not 3x21Ah=63Ah capacity.  Loads approaching the rating will deplete the batteries in a matter of minutes, not hours--better read up on this one at Xantrex's website before getting soaked for $400 thinking you can, e.g., run a normal fridge for hours during a blackout--you can't, and you'll need a \"noisy generator\" anyway to recharge this unit and run other loads.\n\nUPDATE:  I have added an extra 53Ah+78Ah SLA (SealedLeadAcid) battery so I can run real-world devices for \"many\" hours.  These batteries are HEAVY (100+ pounds total), so forget about a \"portable backup pack\" that lives up to the hype at AMAZON etc...\n\n...btw, the \"karaoake\" guy review is total nonsense--his karaoake must be something he uses in a small bathroom where he only entertains himself while he's in the shower.  Try and locate him and get the details and you'll not find him...buyer beware of paid-off testimonials.\n\n***** Bottom line *****\nYou'll be out about $3/Ah (you need at least 200Ah = $600) for the external batteries, plus $SeveralHundred for a 2000W inverter, plus a trip to an auto-parts store for the custom-made cables to attach the batteries in parallel to the inverter.", "label": 0}

I couldn't get it to pick up a leaf the size of a quarter. I've tried every attachment. The only one that is worthwhile is the brush that agitates the debris enough to get it airborne enough for it to suck it up. The only thing it did suck up is the dust in the mats. I thought maybe clearing the dirt chamber would help, and the dust got everywhere. I had a few gravel pieces about half the size of a pea and none of the attachments would suck them up, even though they were on flat surfaces. I'm super disappointed.

{"text": "I live out in a very rural area of the country with frequent power interruptions. I have a mid-sized portable generator, but you have to be home to connect and tend to them.  We didn't want to spend a small fortune on an automated backup generator set up. Our essential loads are small. We are often away for one to two days at a time, so I decided to purchase a Tripp Lite APS1250 from Amazon.com. I almost purchased the smaller APS750, but dug deeper into my wallet and bought the APS1250 ($402 delivered) to be sure it would run what I wanted and not be working hard. My plan was to have this inverter/charger keep the essentials running in our home until I returned and could fire up the portable generator if needed. Essentials to us mean keeping the refrigerator cold in the summer and keeping the furnace running in the winter.\n  I purchased my Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger model APS1250 from Amazon and the service was excellent as usual. Upon opening the factory sealed Tripp Lite box, I discovered the four screws and plastic cover plate for the inverter battery cable connection terminals were  missing. This was not Amazon's fault, so I called Tripp Lite directly hoping they could send them via US postal service saving both myself and Amazon shipping expense and hassle. After two ridiculously long phone calls to Tripp Lite's customer service, I couldn't get anyone to understand what little plastic piece I was talking about. I gave up and decided to forget about that stupid little plastic piece. The unit will work without it.\n  I had previously measured the startup and running power needs of my fridge (1100 watts start up, 170 watts running) and furnace (600 watts start up surge, 300 watts running) with a Fluke 87 multi meter. The lesser expensive APS750 would have been able to handle things, but again I didn't want the unit to have to work too hard. Now with the APS1250 inverter hooked up, I proceeded to test run the inverter/charger using a 12 volt marine battery on my refrigerator and furnace separately to ensure it would work for my purposes. It appeared as though it would satisfy my needs.\n  I read the instruction manual and set dip switches for my wet cell battery and set up the APS1250 connected to only my refrigerator with my 105 Ah marine battery.  Then I purchased two more large high Ah wet deep cycle batteries to achieve a 36-48 hour back up power supply system for the cycling loads I would have hooked to the inverter/charge unit.  A month went by and I noticed the batteries getting a little wet on top. A quick voltage check showed the APS1250 float voltage was too high at 13.85 volts continuously and the Tripp Lite unit was boiling the batteries. This time, an E-mail to Tripp Lite's previously unimpressive customer service and I'm told this is not adjustable, all normal, and the unit is working as designed.\n  A little frustrated because I am into this for a $400 inverter/charger plus another $200 for additional batteries that I cannot return, but I was still convinced that this will do what I need it to do.  I decided to just turn the thing off when I'm home and turn it on when I'm away for my one to two day trips. Time goes by operating it only for short periods of time this way, the 12 month warranty expires, and at 15 months the APS1250 expired and ceased to function as it did previously. Now when turned on it emits an electrical hum that is louder than a conversation, a smell of something burning is quickly noticed, and the unit keeps tripping off with no load applied every time within seconds  after it's turned on.\nAnother e-mail to Tripp Lite's customer service yields no hope. My intelligence is insulted because I'm told the unit is operating normally. Additionally I'm told the warranty time period is up, the chance of any customer good will is ZERO, and getting the thing repaired even at my expense is out of the question, and I quote \"Tripp Lite is not equipped to service our products.\"\n\n  My Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger experience has been completely disappointing. I don't know which is worse, the product, or the customer service.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I previously owned a Dirt Devil Hand Held Vaccum that i used in my car to pick up waste from food thrown out by my 1 yr old and various other debris from shoes not to mention hair. After 3 years of service it finally died on me (Well could not ask for more of its service for the $30 i spent on it).\n\nWas scouring through amazon for a decent vaccum cleaner and i stumbled upon this product. Since amazon has got my back, ordered this product  and i am definitely not disappointed with my decision to go with this bad boy.\n\nNot only it did a better job than my dirt devil to pick up debris on my car floor but it coupled as tire inflator and as well an emergency led light in case of situations.\n\nThe product itself came in a nice little portable pouch that can house the contents of the product and get tucked in nicely in my trunk. My only question that i need to contact the seller is how often do we need to change the HEPA filter (Asking this as my previous vaccum cleaner is a no filter model) and if there would be cheap as it wouldnt make sense to spend a bomb on the filter when the vaccum cleaner itself is inexpensive\n\nI also tried the pointed attachments to inflate my volley ball just for the heck of it and it worked awesome :)\n\nLike the product description mentioned, it came in with all the attachments. Build quality itself is very good and i am super sure this will last for more than what my dirt devil did.

I finally got the unit working, but it took upwards of 10 hours to install and another 10 hours of troubleshooting to get it working. I did not purchase the T-adapter for the wire harness, and spliced all of the wires as shown in the DVD. The T-adapter would most likely have saved installation time. There were no installation instructions for the 791 Bypass in the enclosed information. The installation video is OK for the RS82 install, but is incomplete for the 791 Bypass. The DVD only describes 4 wires that need to be connected for the 791. You actually need to connect 2 more ! Upon calling tech support, I was put on hold for 45 minutes and got cut off. Was on hold for another hour and finally hung up. The best way to contact Bulldog is via E-mail. Got a response the next day and a direct dial line to a support person. This person seemed to be very knowledgeable. After several phone calls and various testing suggestions, we finally determined that not all of the wires on the 791 had been connected due to lack of installation instructions and an inaccurate video.

{"text": "Even though the picture, and all of the descriptions refer to a genuine APC battery, I was sent an \"ABC\" battery instead. While it is fully compatible with the Back UPS, it is very misleading. In addition, you don't get a pre-paid return label to ship the used one back for recycling. Instead, you get a note telling you where you can send it, and that there is a charge for UPS to ship it back. The price is about $6.00 less than a genuine one directly from APC's website. And for the extra $6.00 bucks, you get the pre-paid return label. So the overall cost is about the same. I guess the real test is in how long this \"knock off\" battery will actually last. The real \"APC\" one lasted around 3 years. Only time will tell. But knowing this one isn't the real thing, I would NOT have bought it. But it may turn out to be fine in the long run. Who knows???

{"text": "The Fan Tastic Vent Corp 01100WH Endless Breeze 12V Volt Fan is an acceptably good product and would probably rate a 4/5 on value... I kinda like it but it's a tad bit expensive.\n\nWhat you don't know is its power draw and that's a big deal to those of us living inside battery constraints.  I have measured it and I'll share:\n\nlow:  15 Watts or 1.25 amps @ 12 VDC\nmedium:  27 Watts or 2.25 amps\nhigh:  35 Watts or close to 3 amps\n\nBut... Fan-Tastic should have published that!  The fact that *I* had to document their product cost 'em a star!", "label": 2}

{"text": "Shipped and received promptly.  I would have wanted to know it doesn't do a real good job of holding the tubing during flaring.  I would have wanted to know the interior of the flare wasn't nice and smooth and that the very ends of the flared tubing are too rough.  It makes a \"usable\" flare not a good usable flare.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I've owned about 10 Haynes manuals since the 80's, mostly for motorcycles, and didn't hesitate to order this one because, from past experience, they were top notch when compared to others. Total let-down for the Haynes Mini manual. The pictures are so bad most of them look like black blobs and the ones that aren't are of different non-Mini vehicles. Too many things are generalized and don't relate to the specific model. The organization is such that you have to waste valuable time and energy accidentally reading info that does not apply, especially for a 2007 or newer. The wiring diagrams are a joke. You can tell Haynes just doesn't care anymore and went the way of Chilton's.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This brush is made in China and is not the quality of past brushes.  The backing is plastic and tears easily.  The brush leaves fine colored lint.  I have washed the brush several times trying to get rid of the lint to no avail.  Also the wooden handle is flimsy compared to older green brushes.  Buy American made if you can find it.", "label": 0}
