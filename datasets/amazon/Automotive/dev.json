{"text": "Two years ago, I bought what I thought was a good car cover for the price-I still believe it is for a short term situation. Today, it began to tear from the sun UV and little by little rotting of the materials resulted in flakiness and tears at stress points e.g. mirrors, antenna (short rod was removed) or wherever the material does not lay flat on the surface. I had to degrade my original 4 stars to a 3 star because for the price, it lasted longer than I expected in the Cali sunlight and occasional wind. It never started tearing until it began to flake and rot due to the sun. Now, I am going to have to remove it and replace it with another one because like I said, 2 years of protection for the budget like friendly  price paid is a good deal. Not a 5 star by any means but a 4 for the first year and a half and then down to a 3 after the second year based on value and priced paid.

{"text": "I installed this myself using the accessory harness custom made for my vehicle and it took me about 3-4 hours.  Granted, I have never done any kind of work on a car before (not even an oil change), but I was still able to figure it out.  You need to be pretty brave to take apart your whole dash and start stripping wires connected to the brake system.  At one point my friend came out and was shocked that I had voluntarily dismantled my Lexus.  Definitely read the instructions ahead of time and access their website for specific wiring instructions.  I had to choose one wire out of about 100 to strip back for the final connection.  The hardest part was finding a place to stick it without it being seen or having to worry about it falling down in front of the brake pedal.  They also do not mention that if you have an anti-theft system you will likely have a part of this device showing - a copper ring around your ignition switch.  I might recommend professional installation unless you have a full afternoon and a lot of patience.  Seems to work fine now that I've got it in!\n\nUPDATE\n\nA few months later I ended up pulling this out.  I hated how I couldn't get it up in the dash properly to where I couldn't see it and felt safe about it not falling on my feet.  I also had some electrical problems with the vehicle although I can't say for sure that it was related to this device.  I also hated the copper ring around my ignition.", "label": 2}

This probably shields the signal from the key fob.  My car starts in one second but starter engages for three seconds so there is extra wear on starter when using.\n\nReceived packaged in good condition and all related parts included and unit works as advertised.  Instructions are brief and it helps considerably to view the cd paying attention to every word as that is also brief.  I had to replay the cd several times as some very key phrases where not clearly articulated or emphasized. Instruction are generic in nature and wires under my dash were not easy to get to, 97 Chevy lumina, nor looked like the cd's. So there was confusion initially in figuring out were to start.  The test light is a key tool.  After connecting the fused power cords and taping up the constant power source to protect it from arcing under the dash while I worked near it, I connected the power source for the test light to the other end of the fused power cord.  Also, There are several groups or sets or wiring.  This was not emphasized.  Pay particular attention to what wire set is being used as they all use similar color patterns.  The power, accessories, ignition and starter wires are the larger wires, and are not in the plug wire sets I note below.  There is also a smaller power wire that also joins to the constant power source that goes to the 5 pin anti theft plug.  This wasn't in the paper instructions and very briefly notedin the cd. I watched the image and noticed the gage of wire being shown.  There is also a 16 plug wire set and a 5 plug anti theft wire plug.  Installation from start to finish took 6 hours.  The only option installed was the door locks.  That portion of the instructions were well illustrated.  I have a maintenance background and think that someone with average mechanical skills would take more time to install this.  If you are not comfortable working in a tight area, with brief instructions or unsure about cutting into wires in your car, or taking trim or structural parts out to get to wires, then I would not suggest a DIY, but rather bring this kit to a mechanic to install.  Bulldog has installers noted on their web sight.  The web site is good and I was able to find my cars wire color codes easily enough and print those from a computer.  Adobe flash is required to view video content off the web site.  Video content did not work on My iPad or android phone.  If you have a Vat key theft system you need the 791 part mod to bypass your vat.  After installation pay particular attention to the initialization procedure it needs to be correctly performed to initialize the remote and unit.  Because of the brevity and generic nature of the instructions, I give this kit a 3 out of 5.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is my second Tripp lite inverter/charger product.  I previously had a larger model inverter/charger and it worked fine for about 3 years.  It maintained my back up batteries for my sump pump.  Then in January of 2013  my home started to have an odd odor which grew worse daily.  I had plumbers over (more than once) as the smell was like sewer gas.  I had employees search my home.  Finally a plumbing employee inspecting my sump pump thought the smell was coming from the Inverter/Charger.  I and a bunch of others smell the unit and it was hard to discern it coming from the unit but one could detect it if you did a sort of wave or fan of the hand near the vents.  We decided he was right.  I disconnected it but I was still skeptical it was the source.  I then interacted with Tripp light technical support about this bad odor and they said a slight smell sometimes happened near the end of the life of the unit. But they did not describe the odor as noxious, sour, disgusting and its all those things.  The smell went away slowly.  But it went away.  So the inverter/charger was clearly the source of the smell.  Ok  I tossed that Unit out.  So I bought this one in January, about 9 months ago. Last week my house started to smell again.  I immediately when down to unplug this unit.  The smell has now gone away.  I plan to return it if possible under its warranty if it exists. However, this is a major flaw.  I use this to power my sump pump with about 7 marine batteries. [Its capacity is far more than 7 and it could do 50 or more it says]  So I have to warn you about this smell if you buy this and it reaches this point of its operating \"lifetime\".  By the way the technical person said it would still operate while smelling but that this was a sign it was nearing the end of its useable life.  I urge you not to use it in an building or space where there are people as the smell permeated 3 floors at my home very easily and very quickly.  This is because it is so hard to determine that this is the source of this really bad odor.  You should avoid this unit and these Tripp Light Inverter/Chargers as my two experiences have had this bad odor develop.  I wanted to change brands, but I did qualify for a return under the 1 year warranty.  I sent in emails etc but did not get a response.  I called. I got through and they proceeded by return and gave me a return authorization.  They got the unit.  They could not recreate the smell according to them which I find not a credible claim.  Regardless they did authorize a new replacement unit at no cost.  But note that the replacement only came with a \"continuation\" warranty so because my first unit was say 11 months in of 12 months in warranty I only got a 1 month warranty on the new replacement unit.  I did receive it.  I am using it.  So far so good.  As to their service, I like when I deal with the people.  They did not really respond to my emails except when I had a specific person I was writing.  After that it was fine.  So keep at it and they will respond and it appears that they will honor their 12 month warranty.  But if this goes bad then I am done with warranty so then I will change brands as they warranty claim did not make up for the 2 bad events in my personal history.  If they had acknowledged the smell issue and why it occurred or why it might not occur going forward I would feel differently but the did not they basically denied it existed.  I know it does exist as I experienced it twice now.  The period of returning it; them confirming it was covered and then getting it back to me took about 3 weeks and I didn't like that as I was unprotected for back up on my sump in that period but I had not choice as I did not want to own two of these units even if the other one was from a different manufacturer.\n\nSo that is the update January 2014.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I had to have the AC compressor replaced on my 2003 Mini Cooper. A local shop which specializes in BMWs and Minis priced the job at $1650 plus. At the Mini dealership the price would have probably exceeded $2000. One reason for the high price was that the OEM AC compressor was $1200, and the shop would only use this part. On line I found a new OEM compressor, clutch, evaporator and other required parts for $400. I then found a local shop which does not specialize in Mini repair. They would only do the work if I removed the modular front end from the Mini which was required for an AC compressor replacement. I read the Haynes manual and removed the modular front end in less than 3 hours. I then took the car to the local non specialty shop. They replaced everything , but the parts did cost $450, which included recharging the system with Freon and oil. The labor was $200, so I saved at least $1000 for ,4-6 hours of my own labor.

There is a 1 inch depression in the middle which means only the edges make good contact with the surface that you are washing. Even on a curved surface, the head does not swivel, which means you constantly are trying to adjust the stick angle to get better contact of the mop head with the surface you are washing, and it darn near impossible. This all requires much more effort than using a plain sponge, or my favorite car washing tool, a shaggy mitt with nylon mesh on the other side.

{"text": "I got this product because I recently started using a fish fertilizer mixed with water on my indoor herb garden and it smells AWFUL. I was looking for something that would help cover some of that smell when I use the fertilizer because it really is doing wonders for the plants. This product is doing it!! It is very easy to set up (although the instructions were not very straightforward), all you have to do is plug the adapter into the bottom of the atomizer and then into an outlet. After that you turn the lid and lift it off, fill the inside jar up to the max line with regular water and add a few drops of water essential oil you'd like. Pop the top back on, press the MIST button and start sniffing away! I have used an orange scented essential oil and a lavender scented one so far and depending on how many drops you place in the water, the weaker or stronger the scent is. The first time I put 3 drops in and I thought it was the perfect amount. I left the atomizer on for 2 hours and it then shut off by itself, and left my dining room smelling fantastic! The second time I used 5 drops of the lavender, but the scent was really strong. I moved the atomizer into my living room which is about 2.5x the size of my dining room and the scent was much more manageable and not so overpowering. So I would definitely recommend playing around with the amount of essential oil you use depending on the size of the room. I am really happy with this product and would recommend it to others.\n\nI received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

So I bought the manual hoping it would help me fix it. The manual doesn't cover how to remove the weather stripping. I have since found out how to do this by inspecting the replacement part I purchased. In figuring out what to do, I learned that I need to remove the interior molding in the back of the car. Guess what, the manual doesn't tell you how the remove that either. In the world of car repair this falls somewhere between Simple and Intermediate in complication. Well with the realm of a home mechanic and well with in the scope of this book.\nThis is a shop manual and therefore should cover everything. In my search to find out how to repair the weather striping. I found that the manual states that it doesn't cover how to repair the 'perminent' windows (i.e. non moving windows) becuase the authors believe that repairing the window is to difficult for us readers. The part I need to repair is related to a 'perminent' window, but not part of the window, and therefore might be omitted for this reason, but I don't really know why.\nIf something my be very difficult they should have a note saying so but then contiue explaining how to do it. IMO they should not decide for me.\nTo my above reference to Bently manuals. They are a company that writes shop mauals for VW (my previous cars), Volvo and a few others, unfortunatly not Subaru. They are exellent manuals. They cover everything. Sometimes a little hard to find the info you want but it is there somewhere.\nFrom what I can gather Subaru sells a shop manual.

{"text": "This is a great concept.  It has a handy screen to catch your drain plug and crush washer, and looks like you could just haul it to your local auto parts store for recycling once you finish draining the crankcase. NOT! Once you get past draining a little over 3 quarts the used oil level gets even with the pour spout (small cap) and starts to leak even with the cap screwed on tightly.  This is because there are no gaskets in either the spout cap or the large top cap.\n\nFurther, there aren't enough plastic threads in either cap to prevent leakage.  So, if you're draining a typical 4-quart crankcase, you have to prop this thing up at an angle to avoid the spout leakage, and then transfer it into an actual leak proof container (gallon plastic water bottle?)

{"text": "I saw this product on dealnewsdotcom when it was on sale for 28.37, with shipping.  My due diligence resulted in not making the purchase even at that low price.\n\nToyota Camry from 2007 to present includes a factory installed immobilizer device.  The engine can't be started unless the car detects a radio frequency signal from the key fob.\n\nThis arrangement makes stealing a car much harder for younger, less experienced, \"grab and go\" car thieves.  The usual method is gain entry, break off the key lock with a slide puller, then turn the internal lock mechanism with a pair of pliers.  The car is gone in 60 seconds or less.  The technique is reputedly well known to young teenagers.\n\nThis method, or the more difficult technique of hot wiring, will not start a car that is equipped with an engine immobilizer.\n\nObviously, a DIY remote starter faces the same problem.  The remote starter can bypass the wiring but the car will not start without detecting the RFI chip in the key fob.\n\nThe \"solution\" for this Bulldog RS1100 or any other DIY remote starter is that you have to put your spare, factory supplied key inside the unit.  The \"bypass module\" can be a separate unit or it can be integral, as it is with this RS1100.  The car can then be started remotely because the car detects the RFI signal from the spare key.\n\nThis also means that you have permanently stored a spare key inside your vehicle in a place where every car thief will know to look.  The placement of the remote starter module is dictated by the wiring within any particular vehicle.  You're not going to have a lot of options for where the module, with your spare key inside, is to be found.\n\nDecide for yourself whether this breach of security is worth the convenience of a remote starter.  Personally, I think it's foolish.", "label": 0}

{"text": "So, here's the issue with the Haynes manual.  It's written for more than one model vehicle.  While these vehicles (CRV and Civic) are similar enough to maintain, the narrative of repairs still tries to maintain a commonality between the vehicles.  For those who have good general knowledge of cars, this is probably good enough.  However, for a newbie like myself, I've had to supplement with the internet and friends who've done these things before.\n\nPros:\n- Major Chapter Subjects are divided pretty well\n- Good description of tools and hardware\n- Good recommendations for maintenance schedule\n\nCons:\n- Pages have a ton of information in small font, so it's easy to lose your place\n- Skimming chapters is not simple - the flow of the chapters are not always coherent\n- Images are poor quality and hard to make out if you're a beginner\n- Hard to use the book while you're actually working on the car (not sure if there's a real solution to this, though)\n\nThis manual is much better for the more experienced DIYer.

{"text": "For the price and in the right situations these are good cables.  Good length, good ga. wire and copper connectors. But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves. After shopping around for a week I found this is a great deal.  I shopped all over the Net and in my local stores comparing prices wire length, size, and end clamps.  There are many great items for great prices at Amazon but if you need what I need in a jumper cable go to your local SEARS.", "label": 2}

Without it I put a few drops of essential oil on a tissue and tuck it in my bra for the day. But this was a more attractive and effective method of delivery. I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because the necklace itself is very heavy. Maybe some people like that, but I feel like its a lot of weight on my neck muscles and shoulders.

{"text": "After I wrote the below review, the manufacturer contacted me and explained how to use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\n\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\n\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I recently ordered an aromatherapy diffuser necklace that came with 5 pads for different scents.  I decided that I needed more pads for wearing different essential oils so I went ahead and ordered this kit.  I have to say that I am impressed with the pads.  They are about 3 times thicker than the ones that came with my necklace.  I've included a side by side comparison photo.  They fit perfectly in the necklace, despite the extra thickness as well.  I love that they are all different colors.  I tend to equate different essential oils with a color so keeping track of what oil I used on each pad will be a lot easier.

My only need was to reach across the roof and hood of my pickup; all other areas I wash with a lambs wool mitt.  Fortunately, the 33 length of the wash stick body is adequate for my needs.  The Extends to more than 4 feet long in the description apparently includes the pump being extended which I have found no way to lock in place so it just slides out and in when pulling and pushing; the wash mitt just stands still on the surface being washed.  The lambs wool cover is nice but the advertised flexible head requires a little more pressure to flatten out on flat surfaces than I can apply when gripping with one hand at the end of the 33 handle.  Consequently, the washing motion must be side to side so the area in the raised center gets cleaned.  Paying attention to the pictures in the description, they all show the stick being operated with two hands.  It would have been informative to mention in the text that this is typical to get enough leverage to flatten the head for cleaning flat surfaces.", "label": 2}

{"text": "We got a Powerpack 1500 in 2006 as a backup power source.  It had six advantages and three disadvantages.  Unfortunately, when I recently tested it, sparks flew out of the AC outlets and it looks like the inverter is fried.  Customer service was pretty easy to get to and knowledgeable, although their diagnosis was that it was plugged into something that was miswired (not sure I agree) and it was not repairable (or not worth repairing).\n\nThe advantages:\n\n1.  Fairly portable, so it can be wheeled around from room to room.\n2.  Fairly powerful, although not quite as much as advertised.  I couldn't get it to run a well pump with a starting load of around 1800 watts for a fraction of a second, and 1100 watts continuous.  That's what I got it for originally, since running the well pump for 3 minutes is enough for several more flushes.  But it ran the refrigerator for four hours before running down.\n3.  DC output, so you can use a 12v bilge pump to pump water out of the swimming pool, or a bathtub, for a toilet.\n4.  DC charge, so in a pinch you can charge it off the car at a 10 amp rate.\n5.  The capability of connecting a second external battery for increased run time.\n6.  It is pretty simple to press into service, so setting up the generator can be put off for a time.\n\nThe disadvantages:\n\n1.  The charger is a 12v, 5 amp charger so it takes a day to recharge the unit.\n2.  It doesn't function as a UPS, because it doesn't have a transfer switch like a battery backup UPS.  I have an APC transfer panel that can manage a UPS source, but it assumes that when the panel is driven by a generator, the UPS will pass through the AC source it is plugged into while recharging the battery.  This won't do that.\n3.  You can't charge a second external battery at the same time; it needs to be disconnected and charged separately.\n\nI have two Honda generators and a transfer panel now, after more than three weeks of outages.

And there are many thingd that may void any warranty offered.\n\nI really like that you can use this as a small humidifier without any oil. And my experience has been that using essential oils in the amount recommended will do well with a small room -- but not a big room.\n\nI was looking for an efficient (LED) aromatherapy diffuser that could fill the (smaller) spaces I have. It does.\n\nI received this item free and/or at a discount in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback - which I give on ALL items I review, regardless of purchase price.

{"text": "This company blows. First off, they sent me an installation video in FRENCH. I do not speak French. In addition to that, they probably have the worst tech support I've ever encountered. Music on-hold for an eternity, then it goes to a \"this mail box is full and cannot take new messages\" and you can either press 1 to get put back on hold until it cycles back thru to the mailbox being full again, or just forget about it. Either way the result is the same. I'd call it technical non-support. The one time I did get to talk to someone it was determined that my transponder key bypass module was defective, and I was told I could send it back for repair. Honestly, you can't just send me a new one. It was seriously the cheesiest piece of garbage in the first place. It looks like it couldn't have cost $5 to make, but I have to wait a couple weeks while I send it back, they fix it, and then send it back, instead of just sending me a new one. That's what any reputable company would do if they sent you something that was bad out of the box. I am VERY dissatisfied with this company.

{"text": "I could wish this fan was a little quieter, given the near-silence it often operates in. But, I cannot say a single thing against it in terms of function and quality. On the lowest setting, it moves an astonishing volume of air for the miniscule 1A draw on my batteries. The long 12v cord and multiple built-ins for standing (feet) or hanging (handle or window frame tabs) it are thoughtful and useful features. Entirely worth the substantial price.\n\nUPDATE October 2017: I have to knock two stars off: one for motor quality, and the second for crap customer service. I haven't used the fan in over a year because the motor developed a persistent squeak that made the fan very irritating to have in operation. That was after 6 months of modest use throughout the summer, maybe upwards of 500 hours. When I contacted Fan-Tastic, I was informed that no replacement motor part was available, and I would have to buy a whole new fan if I wanted to fix the problem. That is an ABSURD response, given that the Endless Breeze is really just a roof vent fan in a box, and the overall build quality says 'this can be fixed', not 'this is a disposable piece of crap'. They sell replacement motors for all their roof vent fans, so why not this?", "label": 2}
