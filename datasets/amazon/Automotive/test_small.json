{"text": "I purchased this product because I saw it a few years ago on a top gear episode and with my car's battery taking a decline in recent months I thought it would be good to have a backup.  However, I did not bother to read more then the description and failed to see the reviews that point out that this product will not work on cars with too large of a battery.  I have a 2003 Ford Explorer and the battery was getting old and could not hold enough charge to start the car.  After 45 minutes of trying to plug in this devise multiple times and getting multiple cycles of charge my car still would not start.  The devise also gave off a smell of burning plastic so there's that too.  Overall, this in theory is a great product and I'm sure it works well on new healthy batteries that were accidentally drained, and in a small car, but anything else and its just a waste.", "label": 0}

{"text": "DO NOT purchase this item if you desire to use it to provide AC power to connect a laptop computer charger, it WILL NOT work for that purpose!!!  This item is incorrectly being marketed as being suitable to power office equipment such as a computer and a printer.  You are led to believe it is a Pure Sine Wave power output, which is what is required to provide steady 120 V similar to household current.  This product, however has a Modified Sine Wave output which DOES NOT provide steady 120 V output.  It produces output that varies as much as 115 V +/- 8 V.  This means the voltage output varies between 107 V to 123 V or more.  When installed, this inverter would operate a printer and some other items, however it would not charge a laptop battery.  When I checked the output of my unit it was only producing an output of 105 V.", "label": 0}

I read the various negative reviews and they sounded as if people were using it for devices that exceeded its abilities. Turns out there are other issues besides limited current capacity. When I started using it there would be random losses of power. I found that the center contact is not designed correctly. It bottoms out in the plastic housing, so when pushed in it can easily lose contact intermittently, then get it back. Not good for use in a car. I modified the contact so it behaved more like better CLAs and things improved considerably but there were still random losses of power.\n\nI continued to play around with it using a 12V DC brick that had has a CLA socket as it's output. I could not reproduce the problem when everything is sitting still. The connections I made to connect the coby to the camera seem solid and work just fine in the car using a remote battery pack instead of the coby. I am still unsure what is wrong with it, perhaps I was unable to improve the center contact enough or there is something inside that doesn't like the vibrations of driving. It works nice sitting still at home plugged into the brick, just won't work that well in a moving car.\n\nIf I decide to go further I'll probably modify it by wiring it to one of my better CLAs. This will eliminate the CLA part of it from use and I'll find out if it's just a mechanical contact issue or something in the underlying electronics.", "label": 0}

So far I've replaced the motormount, spark plugs, and brakes thanks to this guide and one thing I love is the provided torque specs because we all know how much shops love to use correct torque specs right. If any more service is needed I can now determine whether the job is feasible or take it to shop.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The unit seems like pretty good quality, but i have not been able to install it yet as one of the three wiring harnesses was MISSING! Instead of three different harnesses, there were 2 identical ones. The other problem that i have with it is that the keys could be labeled better; there is a key on the top left and a lock on the top right, i just know that if i let somebody borrow the car, they'll end up pressing the key to unlock it and end up starting the car. Not a big deal, but the keys could have been maybe a little more thoughtfully labeled, like \"Start\" and \"Stop\", \"Lock\" and \"Unlock\" for example. Just my opinion. Other than that i guess it seems ok!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Updated and shortened review:\nHad this vac for over a month now and really like it.  There are other vacs with good ratings that are just that.  I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.\n\nI use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.\n\nWhat I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.  Plenty of cord for your own car, and with a simple 25' extension you can easily clean a friend's car from your cig lighter. (Saves on gas with a prius as the generator! :))", "label": 1}

{"text": "Researched this cover on Amazon, and due to reviews and sizing information, purchased the U1 size as recommended. Received the cover today, and tried to install it on my Chevrolet Equinox. This particular cover is NOT a good fit for my 2013. When I attempted to wrap the front & rear of the cover completely under the bumpers, the fit was much too tight on the front of the hood, over the rear window wiper arm, and over both rear tail lights. The cover was so tight, that I was concerned not only for the finish of the car, but that it wouldn't be long before the cover tore due to the tightness (and yes, I did fold in the side mirrors prior to installing). Also, one of the plastic grommets used to tie the cover beneath the car was missing from the hole, and 2 pieces were ultimately located, with the retaining ring piece being cracked so that the grommet will not stay in place.\n\nDue to the sizing problem, I checked the specs on the Equinox and found that it is listed as 187.8 inches in length. So ... it would make sense that a cover designed for up to 186 inches shouldn't fit, especially when trying to wrap it fully under the bumpers/air dam. If I were to purchase another Budge cover for this car, which I won't, I would purchase the next size larger, even though many sites recommend the U1.\n\nThe quality of the cover material is very good (better than I had expected), the elastic hem around the bottom of the cover and the grommet areas are well sewn, and except for the broken plastic grommet and the sizing for my car, I would recommend it very highly.\n\nHowever I will now be researching other covers ... fortunately this cover was well enough priced that I am not going to bother to return it ... will probably give it to Goodwill.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This was extremely disappointing. I have had a version of this for both of my cars for the last few years. One of them seemed to be dying so I bought this as a replacement. The difference was startling. My old one had a reliable green, yellow, red sequence. Red came on reliably at the same point. This unit did not. The picture with the light pushed through the garage wall that someone posted said it all. It is completely unreliable. It usually does nothing until the red light comes on and then you have no idea whether the car is in the right spot or not. I took it off and repaired my old unit instead.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a.  I picked it because of the 2000 publication date.  BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.", "label": 0}
