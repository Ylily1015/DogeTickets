{"text": "The one-day shipping is great but please read the fine print first.  I ordered a gift card for my sister and her husband.  They were on vacation so I had it shipped to their post office box rather than their home.  While the terms of one-day shipping prohibit this, when I placed my order there was no alert at check-out, otherwise I would have had it shipped to me and mailed it myself.  The card was delivered by UPS and simply set on their porch for anyone to see and steal or be blown away by the wind.  I had to drive to their home, retrieve the card, and mail it myself as they were gone for another six days.  The problem is that Amazon had the post office box address on the label; UPS changed the delivery address to their home which is totally irresponsible.  The irony is that I even provided my phone number on check-out after being prompted; UPS never called me.  While I should have read the fine print first, I also feel that Amazon should have had some way of preventing me from entering a post office box number on the shipping address.  Furthermore, it was completely inexcusable for UPS to change the address especially without calling me first.", "label": 2}

Then I tried to get the daily free app and recieved an error message saying I needed to have a credit card attached to account to buy apps.\n\nThinking that couldn't be true I contacted Amazon customer support. After 45 minutes on the phone they confirmed that you can not purchase Kindle Fire Apps (even free ones) using a gift card. You must have credit card attached to the account to purchase apps.\n\nIn other words, gift cards can't be used like credit cards or cash. There are things you can't buy with them on Amazon.\n\nOther than this issue, I'm happy with the Kindle Fire. However, since apps are one of the key kid features on the Fire, I can't help but wonder if it makes sense to gift it to anyone who doesn't have a credit card.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Amazon gift cards are the biggest fraud I have ever seen! My husband was issued a $50 gift card from his work over a year ago and had been waiting to use it on something he or I needed. With Christmas just around the corner he and I thought it would be a great idea to use the gift card to buy gifts with. My husband spent $24 dollars and change leaving me a balance of $25 dollars to use if I wanted to buy something. I thought hey this is perfect! I can buy my nephew the movie he asked for and a few other small items for stockings and not break the bank.\n\nWell of course life doesn't work out the way it is supposed to. Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)\n\nDon't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.", "label": 0}

I tried it again and it still did not work so I called Amazon Customer Service.  After talking to someone (who was easy to understand) for ten minutes she hung up on me.  Then I called back and got a lady with a very heavy accent who was super hard to understand.  I talked to this lady for over 30 minutes and had to deal with her asking the same questions over and over and not helping me at all.  I finally asked for a manager and she told me she will let him know that I want to speak to him.  After 5 minutes on hold she came back to the phone without the manager!  She told me he was busy and she did the best she could to help me and was about to hang up on me! I told her that I needed to speak to the manager and I was willing to wait.  She put me back on hold and about 2 minutes later the manager came to the phone.  After talking to the manager who did nothing to help; he told me he was going to forward this information on to the gift card department by email and they would get back to me within 24 hours.  At this point I learned the manager was just as unless as the employee in customer service and nothing was going to get done with them.  So a few hours later I got an email from the gift card department and it said ....We would best be able to help you if you call our customer service line.  ....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  At this point, I was pissed so I waited a few hours to reply in order to gather my thoughts and calm down.  About 5 hours after the gift card department replied the manager replied tell me that he sent my request and they would get back to me within 1-2 business days --- This was different information then what he told me on the phone and a delayed reply since the gift card department had replied already.  ....This story is getting too long ...so long story short after talking on the phone the next day to two more people someone finally worked out it out; it was almost not worth the 30 dollars!

Very disappointed in this fact, and their only response when calling to voice my concern was to tell me they'd send that department a note, no apology of any kind.", "label": 2}
{"text": "A gift card is a great idea for computer literate people. Unfortunately, I bought a gift card for someone on his 80th birthday. Although he uses the computer regularly, he left the credit with Amazon for months until I finally visited him and spent the gift card online with his wife's suggestion. He was only happy when the merchandise arrived at his door.  All in all, I will still use this as a gift idea in the future but will save it for those who will enjoy spending it. After all, it's really takes little effort to use.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Usually I am very satisfied with Amazon.  I ordered a gift card to be sent to me to give as a gift. I ordered a $50 card but received a $100 card with a gift note from some one I didn't know to some in LA. Instead of just keeping the $100 card, I decided to do the right thing and return it. I called customer service, spoke to some one right away, but was put on hold three times with the same awful music. At first he couldn't find my order although I could see it just fine. After he scrolled half way down the screen, viola, there it was. It was, afterall,  the second order rom the top. Finally he cancelled the card I got, and is sending me the correct one. At least I hope so. I was on the phone a total of 35 minutes, most of that time on hold. Worst ever Amazon experience!", "label": 0}

Since she's a minor who didn't have an amazon acct or a credit card getting everything set up so she could actually buy something took us a while.

Thanks bunches, Amazon!  Good luck people, I hope this doesn't happen to you.  Maybe if you just order it on the date it is to be delivered, that would work.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I live in Toronto and have wanted to buy two new Kindle Paperwhites online for several months but, when I go to make the final click, a message pops up and tells me, without explanation, that they can't be shipped to Canada. In anticipation of their becoming available, I  gave a friend an Amazon.com gift card and I told her that the Kindle would follow when it becomes available. I now am giving up and will ask her to use the gift card for something else and we'll get another kind of eReader. I wish that Amazon would explain the problem with shipping to Canada and do it before customers go through the entire process before finding out that they've wasted their time.\n\nToronto Ted\n\nPS Since sending my review to Amazon.com, I have spoken to someone who supposedly knows about Kindles there and she told me that the Kindle Paperwhite is available from retailers in Canada whose names and phone numbers she gave me. I then checked with those retailers and none of them had ever heard of this model. I have also done some searches on the web and found numerous websites confirming Amazon.com's policy.", "label": 0}
