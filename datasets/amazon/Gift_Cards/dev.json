It is easy to use, and works with any purchase you make. Whether it is buying a great book or downloading your favorite song through the Amazon MP3 store, it really works great. It is a nice and convient way to help you buy anything that your little heart desires on amazon.

After a week or two I decided to check if the person had received the card and she said she hadn't (perhaps she thought it was spam and didn't open it?) So I think there should be a setting that allows the buyer to specify a certain amount of time after which she will be notified that the gift has not been picked up. I just don't like to keep track of more things than necessary. I also hope that recipients of gift cards are send reminders to use them.", "label": 2}

So many times going to their site and paying shipping is still about 3-5 dollars cheaper. Plus if I order more than 1 item I'm saving 10 dollars. I now buy my nutritional supplements from a site I bought on Amazon and with a $200 order I save about 70 - 80 dollars. I feel like I've been screwed for years but no more.

The bottom of the box had a seethrough platic panel that showed the barcodes. It's fine, but would be nicer if the box had no openings like that. It's a mysterious little box and sort of invites people to turn it over. Would be nice if someone sold empty giftcard boxes though.", "label": 2}

When I mentioned a couple of times, \"Do you guys read your comments on how most of these gift cards have the same complaints?\" They acted clueless. Also, they only do customer service responses via email, even after repeated requests for them to call me back - they never do. You have to initiate phone contact.

I just lucked out - it never would have occurred to me to check reviews on gift cards from Amazon. I just stopped to look at the gift card display in the store and was pleasantly surprised to find Amazon cards as one of the choices. It's ironic that the whole joy of the Amazon shipping experience for me is the online ease and fast, efficient delivery and that's the very thing that caused so much frustration for so many people this holiday. Now, I'm inclined to wonder about some of their electronic systems. I hope they work out their problems..", "label": 1}

I also dislike sending money even if the bills are fresh, crisp and in a nice bank envelope. But everyone likes money and Amazon sells everything, so why NOT buy anyone an Amazon Gift Certificate? You can send one for any amount by E-mail or print one at home and include it in a nice card or (my favorite), buy a Gift Card made out to the relative and send it to myself, where I can include it in a nice Holiday card. This is the perfect gift!\n\nOn an aside, you know how tough banks are about credit cards lately. If you don't use your card in a month or usually a year, your card can be cancelled or the credit limit will be reduced (I have had this happen). So I took my cards with zero balances and bought myself $5 worth of gift certificates made out to myself. Now it shows the banks that I am using my valuable cards and all I have to do is pay off that $5 the next time the bill comes around. I know that most brokers and banks well raise an eyebrow at this, but these are weird times and I will do anything to keep my credit score high. Plus, I get to get a cool gift for myself. PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE IMMEDIATELY! Have fun shopping!\n\nAfterthought:  Always include a nice card or personal touch to your Amazon.com Card.  It appreciated more than you would think!

{"text": "The above item was requested for immediate delivery on 5/24/14.  I was notified that it had been sent but never informed it was delivered.  I had to go through customer service to have it delivered.\n\nAlso on 5/11/14  I ordered another gift card to be delivered to a different recipient which was marked as sent but never as  delivered.  After contacting customer service I was informed that it was undeliverable and the charge was credited to my credit card.\n\nThe problem is I was never contacted about these problems.  Up until now I thought Amazon Gift  Cards was a great idea.  However, I NO LONGER HAVE ANY FAITH THAT I CAN ORDER A GIFT CARD AND BELIEVE IT WILL BE DELIVERED.  Especially since I am never notified that there is a problem with the delivery (the most important part).  I am extremely disappointed.\n\nFrom my last two experiences it is apparent that Amazon has a problem with deliveries and/or notifying the customer when it occurs and trying to work the problem out.", "label": 0}
