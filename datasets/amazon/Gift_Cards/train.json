Fret not, I am not going to bore you all by turning this into my own personal therapy session. But word to the wise, if you are buying an Amazon gift card for someone who lives in a foreign country, as is the case with my family member who lives in Canada, know that Amazon has sites in other countries.\n  After inquiring, I'm still not sure if a card purchased at the American website can be used in a country like Canada, or any other country for that matter.\n  If my gift turns out to be a dud, I'll be bummed. That's why I'm writing this, to let others know that Amazon operates in other countries, that have their own individual websites, and that hopefully, with a little awareness( which unfortunately I sometimes lack), you won't be left feeling bummed out by your Christmas shopping experience.", "label": 0}

I basically wanted to convert a Visa debit gift card into an Amazon.com gift card. I put the amount of the card in, the number and expiration date. Amazon accepted it as payment, but after hours of not receiving a confirmation e-mail I checked the site to see what was going on. The site claimed they could not confirm the payment, yet they had already taken money off the Visa gift card. I contacted customer service who told me a Visa gift card is not the best way to purchase an Amazon gift card and they would refund the money to the Visa gift card. I then put in another order using my Amazon.com credit card. A card I have used thousands of times before and never had a problem. This time, I received the same message I got when using the Visa gift card. I contacted Customer Service again. The first person I spoke to told me I had a \"Block\" on the account. She could not tell me why that was there, and she informed me she could remove it immediately. This claim brought me some concern so I asked to speak with her manager to find out the reason  a \"Block\" had been placed. The manager claimed there was no \"Block\" on the card and the sale should have gone through fine. So, I again went back and checked on the sale. Again there was a message that it could not be paid using the payment option I had selected. I called back again and told them to cancel the sale. This is extremely disappointing to me, as I have felt for quite some time that Amazon was one of the last customer service oriented sellers around. I guess they too have been pushed to the \"Make money, screw the customer\" attitude this country has been forced into with our economic situation. A trusted company has gone down the drains.

{"text": "Hope you are not on a deadline when they say free overnight shipping included with this $100.00 gift card purchase because I do suspect it will be late like mine was! Ordered on Friday with Monday (notice I said free overnight shipping.) delivery date and on Tuesday when I decided to see why I had not received on Monday, I found out it was routed to the wrong delivery area (it went to New York) and there was no updated estimate delivery date available.  If I had known the shipping would be an issue, I would have had it sent directly to the recipient of this gift as they live out of state. They will be visiting later this week and I really wanted to present it to them in person.  I don't really think the \"product\" purchased was bad...can't hardly go wrong with a gift card. But, the advertised shipping was one of the main reasons I chose this particular gift.  BIG disappointment right about now. :(\n\nSo today is Wednesday and as I write this it is 9:00 p.m. Still no gift card!  Oh, and my bank account has already been drafted (on Monday - the original expected date of delivery) for the amount of the card I purchased! ($100.00) VERY BIG disappointment right about now!!!  :( :(\n\nThursday and still waiting....\n\nOkay, UPS delivered the item late Thursday evening - around 7:00 p.m. It was raining outside and the delivery man barely tapped twice on my door and dropped the package. He practically ran back to his truck.  If I had not been there to receive it,or hear him even attempt to knock, who knows where it would have ended up at. (Currently my state is under a tropical storm warning with wind gusts of up to 65 mph, but no rain at the time of delivery.) All in all, I must really say that my experience is not so much with the Amazon gift card  as it is with the delivery. UPS totally failed on this one and, the saddest part is that it reflects on Amazon. USPS would have been faster in this instance. They would have delivered in five days- not seven! Oh, one more thing, the tin was slightly bent but really barely noticeable. Besides, my son won't be spending the tin,", "label": 2}

I had ordered the holiday gift cards in the past and had no problems. (and the item is shown with envelops) When I spoke to the operator she was very kind and put me on hold to get some advice on this oversight. When she returned she explaind that she was told the gift cards no longer came with envelopes. Why would I order gift holiday cards without envelopes? She then gave me a small credit and directed me to a link to ORDER and pay for blank envelopes. This was a week before Christmas. I was annoyed, but I needed the envelopes so I did place the order. Long story short, three days later I received a whole new order of gift cards with envelopes and the other gifts I had ordered through amazon. So I called again, there was a glitch and all of my orders were doubled. And in the second order the envelopes were included?.?? It turns out giftcard attached to holiday cards do come with envelopes. So she was kind, but misinformed and now I have a box of envelopes I will never use and had to go to UPS to return all of the doubled items. And hope that when I am credited ( because of course I was charged twice) the monies, that this will not have voided the cards that I did give out to my nieces and nephews.", "label": 2}

Saw an ad for Amazon gift card promo buy $50 get $15 and thought yippee even better than 1 stop shopping. I wanted purchase and try for myself to be sure it would be a great gift and easy for them to use as well. So I purchased $25(2x) =$50 for myself to see how the process works & was pleased to see a great selection choices for those birthdays coming in couple days I could send them E Cards & for those I have time to mail actual wrapped cards. Then I was happy to receive via a statement by Amazon that I did qualify for the $15 gift with my $25(2x) =$50 purchase and that I would receive that in an email in couple days. Awesome! Once I receive notice of the 2 eCard I began to purchase things for my pup since it's her birthday too. But I had to call customer service to activate because at the time of purchase I had gotten the message my gift card was invalid. Doable fix with great customer service but not what you want to put a teen thru for a gift. But was thinking not a bad thing if your getting $15 promo in addition. Big disappointment is 5 days after purchase I hadn't receive the $15 gift promo email so today after time consuming research I find that I was not eligible for promotion after all even though receiving notice of qualifying on day of purchase. Disappointed! But glad I didn't purchase $100s worth of gift cards right away and went through the process to see what the teens could expect. 5 days did put me behind and with the sour taste am now opting to mail them cash in a card.

{"text": "DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MEMBERSHIP FOR ANY REASON\n\nHal, the creator of the ECA has famously stated earlier on how TOS/EULA's are so dangerous to the industry with their legal jargon and constantly changing terms. So instead of enforcing his supposed beliefs into his own organization he does the exact same thing here yet even to a higher degree, by pulling shady things like forcing users into mandatory arbitration agreements striping away their legal rights, forcing through expired credit cards by changing the date, removing the lines stating we could cancel by phone and then stating we get a notice 30 days before the subscription ends to make cancelations yet we have to submit the request to cancel at least 30 days prior to the end date. All the while making changes to the TOS with no notice this has been done and without contacting any of its members.\n\nThe ECA advertises discount that do not exist such as getting 10% off direct2drive purchases. Its advertised as a perk before joining but logging into the benefits section there is no discount for them but an expired coupon for Borderlands. It has been this way for several weeks and all requests for support just avoid the question stating they're working on new discounts or that they don't have any control over what the sponsors offer.\n\nThe situation was made entirely worse when the ECA decided to announce all of the sudden the autorenew button on the website never infact worked at all after leaving it up for several weeks. The announcement was made that users would then need to pay for certified mail to cancel which is ridiculous and seems to go directly against CT statutes prohibiting this activity. Making it difficult to cancel for users only put the message out that the ECA was only interested in taking money from its users who didn't want to put up with all the roadblocks you set up to cancel. I will say it again- the ECA has removed all methods of canceling your account online. They require a credit card at signup for a reason, they intend to do everything in their power to prevent users from canceling only to be able to charge you every year. The reasoning they say this is they want a paper trail, which is funny considering they state they're going going \"green\".\n\nInstead of Hal and the ECA taking this opportunity to reassure members and correct the PR nightmare at hand, they instead take to attacking its members in his statement placing the blame on everyone but the ECA and still avoided important questions people were waiting on answers for.\n\nIf you go to their  forums looking for answers you will be met with a great deal of hostility from the moderators who instead of offering help and answers simply deleted threads and threatened bans for asking questions that had been asked before, while at the same time refusing to give the actual answer or where they could find it. Again, you will get banned for asking for help there.\n\nThe ECA is a scam. They will steal your money and instead of fighting for consumer advocacy and rights they suppress them.", "label": 0}

With Christmas just around the corner he and I thought it would be a great idea to use the gift card to buy gifts with. My husband spent $24 dollars and change leaving me a balance of $25 dollars to use if I wanted to buy something. I thought hey this is perfect! I can buy my nephew the movie he asked for and a few other small items for stockings and not break the bank.\n\nWell of course life doesn't work out the way it is supposed to. Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)\n\nDon't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.", "label": 0}

{"text": "UPDATED 12/26/13: Comments 'Revised' due to UPS holiday shipping problems broadcast in National News ... rating increased to 2 stars.\n\nPROS:\n- Can be shipped to address of person receiving gift\n- Limited capability to send personalized message.\n\nCONS:\n- Likely due to UPS issues ... Not Delivered on Expected Date (projected to be 2-3 days late)\n- Likely due to UPS issues ... Confusing delivery status info.\n- Inconsistent experience to personalize messages\n- Inflexible ... Message can  (& can not) be printed on Card\n\nACI Gift Cards, Inc. ... Ordered Amazon & Starbucks gift cards.  A Holiday Card comes with the Amazon gift card, but a personalized message can not be printed on it (only on the invoice).  However, for the Starbucks gift card, you can pay extra to add a Holiday Card with a personalized message.  Expected Delivery for both cards is now 2-3 days beyond the 'original' expected delivery date (likely due to UPS issues reported in National News for Holidays).  SUMMARY: This service allows you to select a gift card and ship it to the address of the person receiving the gift.  However, it is inconsistent in allowing a personal message to be added to a Holiday Card.  Problematic delivery may be due to UPS problems BUT to be sure read product & seller reviews to confirm delivery performance.  If you want to personalize a Holiday or Birthday card to be sent with your gift card, you may be better served buying a gift card and Holiday Card locally and using an expedited shipping method.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I purchased six $50 Amazon Gift Cards from a local supermarket (Bi Lo) to give as Christmas Gifts in 2015 (something I've done for many years). My Sister-in-law, the recipient of one of those $50 Amazon Gift Cards called me to say that she's lost the Gift Card (most likely accidentally discarded with all of the Christmas paper, etc. and burned in the trash). I told her \"no problem\", since I had kept my receipt from Bi Lo that includes the Amazon Gift Card Number, and I felt certain that Amazon would be able to see that no purchases had been made against their Gift Card Number and that either Amazon or Bi Lo would be able to cancel that card and issue a new one, or Credit her online Amazon Account $50 and bypass issuing a new physical card altogether. I was sadly mistaken.... when she initially contacted Amazon, they told her that since the Amazon Card was purchased from Bi Lo, we would need to take the matter up with them. I went to Bi Lo and was told that there wasn't anything that they could do and that I would need to contact Amazon. Since my Sister-in-law had already contacted Amazon and been turned away, I decided since I was the one who made the purchase and had the receipt, I would call my Credit Card Company first to see if they might be able to offer some assistance in getting the matter resolved since I had purchased all of the Gift Cards with my Credit Card. After 30 minutes discussing the details with my Credit Card Company, they said they understood my dilemma but weren't able to dispute the charge with Bi Lo. They suggested I contact Amazon directly since I had my receipt with Amazon's Gift Card number on and since it was Amazon's gift card. So... after about 30 minutes on the phone with a very nice gentleman from Amazon who made 2 attempts to get his Supervisor to approve some type of credit for the loss, he sadly informed me that Amazon isn't responsible for purchases of their Gift Cards that aren't made from their website. I told him that since Amazon isn't willing to offer any assistance, even though they can clearly see in their system a $50 unused Credit on that lost Gift Card and since I had my receipt with their Gift Card number printed on the receipt (proof that I had purchased their Gift Card), I felt as though Amazon had ROBBED me of $50, since the only one who will benefit financially from this gift transaction is Amazon and I had certainly not intended to add \"Amazon\" as one of my 2015 Christmas names to buy for! Furthermore, I told him that I would not be making any more purchases from Amazon directly or purchasing any other Amazon Gift Cards in the future and would encourage others to do the same.

The $100 gift card came 7 days late to my door by UPS on December 27, with the tracking info showing the package bouncing between two local SF Bay Area UPS Distribution Centers for a week, even though the distribution center received the package in less than two days. There was no reason, since the address was correct. Delivery of these Gift Cards, which is nice to physically give to family in hardcopy, through UPS cannot be trusted.

{"text": "You gotta read the fine-print.  It states on the product page and on the card itself that these must be redeemed online and not in-theater.  Fandago is a third-party service, so you can't use their gift-cards in-theater.  It's a pain... but at the same time, it's a little ridiculous reading all these complaints from people who can't be bothered to actually research what they're buying.  That should just be something you do, regardless.  If you want a gift-card to use in-theater, you gotta get the theater-specific gift-cards.  Not a third-party card produced for use on a specific website.\n\nThe convenience fee's are steep, but that's where their profit comes from, so I can't complain too much.  Running a service like this isn't free.  And a lot of theaters offer promotional offers or rewards programs that can cut down or even eliminate fees.  Problem is, these cards aren't perfect and the customer service is pretty mediocre, so you can run into problems pretty easily.\n\nIf you encounter a problem and are having trouble with Fandango, I'd also recommend calling your local theater and explaining the situation calmly.  (Aka, don't throw a fit, since the theater and Fandango are not the same thing.)  It's possible that if you can't get help from Fandango, the theater might be able to swap your tickets for another time/movie at the very least, or work out another solution.\n\nOn the whole, I really don't recommend Fandango cards.  It's a lot easier, and sometimes cheaper, to just get cards for your specific theater, since they usually sell tickets on their own website.", "label": 2}

Multiply those loans and gifts by the numbers sold each year, and Amazon is getting Billions of $ in interest free loans and unintended gifts.  THERE IS A SOLUTION.  CHECK YOUR PURCHASE HISTORY AND IT WILL TELL YOU IF THE CARD HAS BEEN REDEEMED!!!  I found 7 gift cards, dating back as far as 2009, totaling around $400, that were never redeemed.  The recipients never got them.  I was able to resend and tell the recipients to check and insure that the e-gift cards were not blocked by their spam filters.

I called Amazon customer service and they told me they did not show any evidence that I had purchased these gift cards (even though my bank card stated I paid for them) and they would have to contact a \"gift card\" representative to figure the situation out and it could take up to 3 business days. Since then I have talked to numerous customer service representatives, of all whom I could not understand fully because they were based out of the country and it wasn't until the last person I talked with, that she said at any point I could have asked for an American based representative, even though I had asked numerous times to speak with someone who spoke better English, I never got anyone.  Last night was the last straw for me when the unclear customer rep stated the same dialog I have been listening to for the past 4 times, I just told them to refund me my money and to be done with this nonsense. She told me they would refund the money in 3-5 business days, but the gift card department would get back to me via email in 3 business days, I won't hold my breath.

{"text": "This product gets five stars because it's exactly what it's advertised to be: a wire bird cage-style card holder (the type that's so fashionable at weddings these days).  The top portion of the card holder is hinged and easily opens and closes.  It also can be locked (lock of your choice sold separately) in case any unsavory individuals show up to your wedding/event (I'm looking at you, hotel bartender with the goatee who keeps making eyes at the maid of honor!).  It decorates easily with ribbon / flowers to match your color scheme.\n\nMy only caveat about this card holder would be its actual size - it's small!  Today's wedding cards are much too big to lay flat in this card holder.  Also, many didn't even fit through the openings.  And, if you have a family of impatient drunks (don't judge), cards easily get backed up.  If you're having an event where you anticipate more than 20 - 25 cards, then please entertain other options.  This card holder would be great at a bridal or baby shower, but unless you're having a small to moderately-sized wedding this card holder ain't going to cut it.\n\nAgain, it's a great product; just make sure you're aware of the size and plan accordingly.", "label": 1}

On another occasion, I tried to send one to my daughter back in the May '12 timeframe, and she never recieved it.  I'm not clear on what her problem is/was but the incoming email may have been picked up by both her addresses as spam.  I have resent the card several times and it is still just sitting there in a \"sent\" mode.  I found out I could not back it out and cannot use the funds to acquire other products so I'm basically out that $100.00.

I've never had to do this in the past, but things change so who knows?  I went online to activate it, there was no place to do so.  The direction was simply wrong.  So I called customer service (you provide a telephone number and they call you back).  The first time the phone rang I was on hold for a few minutes before the call was mysteriously terminated.  So I clicked on the button (online) again to have them call me a second time.  This time a human came online.  He was a confused human.  His English was OK, but what he was telling me was hard to understand.  He didn't seem to understand the issue.  I'd purchased a gift card for my son, my son had attempted to redeem the gift card, and was told there was a problem with it.  So this person put me on hold.  I took the opportunity to 3-way my son into the conversation.  So when the person came back we provided the activation code and all other relevant information, we all navigated to the various pages of interest, my soon looked at the Amazon Wallet in his account ($0.00), the person asked him to input the code (he did), the same message came back \"problem with card\" and the balance was still ($0.00).  The person went away again, and when he came back he said there was a problem with these cards.  So the Christmas-themed card I'd purchased for my daughter would also not work. My son told me that after we all hung up the customer rep called him back to ask my daughter to try her card, just to be sure.  It didn't.  Another 15 minutes wasted. So AMAZON is resending them.  As you may have gathered, collectively my son and I probably spent close to two hours attempting to resolve the issue.  Since the new cards have not arrived as of yet, it is still up in the air as to whether or not it has been resolved.  And since the customer rep said there was a problem with the Christmas-themed cards, this may end up being a disaster for AMAZON.  BTW, the Happy Birthday themed gift card I purchased for my daughter at the same time worked fine.", "label": 0}

I picked out the 'Happy Birthday' gift card template, added some personalized words and selected a cool photo from our last vacation together. To my disappointment when I continued to the check out page Amazon had changed the template to a plain gift card, picture included, but  the 'Happy Birthday' message was replaced with 'A Gift for You' message. So plain and unspecial! I was not able to edit or change it back. I contacted customer service to ask why I was not able to have the Happy Birthday template which I selected  and the response I received was a very complicated set of instructions requiring me to cancel the order, resubmit, etc, etc. it was just a gift card! It was sent on his birthday! I had followed all of the instructions the first time! I had no intention of trying to cancel it and risk him being told his gft was worthless when he went to redeem it. I just hope the photo came through and he got a smile on his face! That was my intention all along. He did say in his thank you note he received an Amazon gift card, no mention of the cool photo.

I went to bed thinking it would be OK'd and delivered overnight. Ten hours after the purchase time, still not delivered. Called my bank, was told Amazon had never requested approval of the transaction. Called Amazon, was told it could be four more hours before it was approved.\n\nI told Amazon to cancel the transaction, they told me it would be done immediately, and I would get a receipt confirming the cancellation.\n\nOne hour later, I get notification that the card was delivered. Apparently the transaction was not cancelled as promised. I had been in the process of purchasing a different gift when the delivery notice came in, so I was lucky it came through when it did.\n\nThe lesson here? Let the buyer beware. Amazon's promise of \"five minute delivery\" in my case was way off base. What's worse, their processes for approving transactions leave very much to be desired. When talking to customer service - both the original representative and his supervisor - I was only told \"you just have to wait.\" There was nothing anyone could do to help me.\n\nBecause I purchased this card to be delivered for a party (which didn't happen), this was a completely unacceptable situation that has left a very nasty taste in my mouth regarding the use of Amazon Gift Cards.

{"text": "I have used this product/ feature before with no problems.  However, this last time was HORRIBLE.  The whole point of these printable gift cards are that they are fast and easy.  That was not the case this time.\nI logged in to Amazon, chose my card, put in all my info, etc. and clicked to purchase the product.  It told me an email would appear in my box shortly.  It did.  It said something to the effect of \"This is a confirmation of your order.  Another e-mail should arrive shortly with instructions for printing your card.\"  Previously, the second email has appeared nearly simultaneously with the first.  Not so this time.  I waited and waited.  After 15 minutes, when it still had not arrived, I went back to the Amazon site to check the status of my order.  It told me that it was still trying to confirm/ verify my credit card.  Mind you this is the same card I've been using on Amazon for *years* and it isn't close to expiry, nor is it close to the credit limit, so I didn't see what the problem was, but I waited some more.  When another 30 minutes passed and the email still had not appeared I called customer service.  (We had reached the point where it was time to leave for the party we'd bought the card for.)\nThe customer service person was not very helpful, and apparently not very bright.  I explained that I'd been waiting for 45 minutes, and he said \"Yes, I think we can help you within the next 45 minutes.\"  I tried again, saying that I had *already* been waiting 45 minutes, and it was time for me to leave the house, and could he please see what the problem was quickly.  He came back and told me that they were verifying my credit card.  Again, I explained that I *knew* that from my status check, but I wanted to know *why* they were still verifying.  He put me on hold to check on it.  About 5 minutes later he came back on the line and told me that the problem was taken care of, and that I would be getting the email with instructions to print the gift card within the next 24 hours.  At this point I had pretty much lost my patience.  I told him that I didn't need it in 24 hours, I needed it NOW, which was the whole point of the stupid thing.  I told him that he'd better put a manager on the phone right away, and that if my problem wasn't fixed they would loose me and my family as customers.\nLuckily the manager seemed to be a smart person.  I was on hold for another 5 minutes before the manager got on the phone.  When she did get on, she told me that she'd taken care of the problem, and would I please check my email one more time.  Thank goodness the email was there, and I was able to immediately print the gift card, and we were only about 15 minutes late for our party.\n\nI do think these printable gift cards are a great idea, and have been happy with them in the past.  I don't know what happened that made my \"instant\" order take over an hour this time, but it will definitely make me think twice before using this product next time.  My recommendation to anyone who uses it in the future will be \"Don't wait until the last minute.\"  I find this sad, because that is supposed to be the beauty of the thing.  Oh well.  I hope it was just a one-time fluke.  Good luck.", "label": 0}

It arrived after Christmas and took several calls to figure out which one was the activated one.\n\nTotally Amazon's fault for not arriving on time.  Through this whole farce, the web site showed cutomers that it could arrive the next day even though they were taking 7-10 days just to process them.

Whether the recipient wants to purchase software applications or physical goods to be shipped makes no difference. Apparently Amazon does not ship to South Africa. There may be a good reason for this, but why can you not sell games/applications to people in South Africa? These things do not require physical delivery. And if this is the case, why do you not have some kind of control in place to warn people with South African based e-mail addresses that their gift cards will be completely valueless, which is the minimum any consumer would be entitled to expect in such a case? Amazon was prepared to take my $75.00 and send the gift card to an e-mail address in South Africa, but now refuses to honour the card.

So I took a chance and gave out a set from one of the boxes and held onto the other set just in case.  As my luck would have it, when my nephews and nieces tried to use the cards, they didn't work.  The gift cards I gave out were the invalid ones.  Fortunately, my nephews and nieces are good kids and they knew I would make it right.  So, through the help of my sister-in-law and a lot of time texting, we got the good card information to the kids.  Even though it all worked out in the wash, Amazon certainly could have made it a lot easier with one little email.  I'll definitely have to reassess my gift card purchases next year.", "label": 2}

{"text": "If you've never had a problem shopping from Amazon.com, then you really are not experienced enough to be giving the \"gift\" of Amazon to someone else.  Wait until you've experienced your first screw up, and then evaluate.\n\nI received a gift certificate, but have had trouble using it, because Amazon.com's outsourced customer service does not handle issues well.  They are apparently scripted to say that an appropriate person will contact you within 48 hours, but in my experience, follow up contact is not timely.  When contact is made, it has been to tell me that the issue was not well documented by the prior agents and to start over explaining my concern once again.  After that, I was told, once more, to wait 48 hours for follow-up that did not come.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe problem is that Amazon.com has apparently fire-walled these folks in Bangalore (or some other asian town) from the rest of the company.  Therefore, there can be no quick responses to customer concerns.  For me, after five contacts, I spoke with a \"team lead\" who indicated that prior agents had not documented the subject matter of my prior calls (even though I was promised a pompt resolution by those agents).\n\nAdd to all this the fact that during the recent holiday season, Amazon.com raised the price of the item I wished to purchase more than once, at the same time that the item's manufacturer was offering it for considerably less.  This makes having my \"gift\" money tied up in an Amazon.com account less than ideal.\n\nDo not expect that the person to whom you intend to give a gift will not have to deal with the customer service department.  Try to be forward-thinking enough to consider that a problem might occur.  If it does, the recipient will likely have a very negative experience, regardless of the variety of products offered by Amazon.com.\n\nWhen I asked an Amazon.com customer service agent why Amazon.com was charging 150% of what the manufacturer was selling the product for directly, I was told that the additional expense should be considered to cover the expert customer service available at Amazon.com.  This is terribly amusing, considering that the only thing that the agents tend to do is instruct the customer to wait 48 hours for someone else to address the problem (which, in my experience, does not happen).\n\nIf you are set on letting someone choose their own gift, you should consider a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard.  That way, the recipient could use the funds at Amazon.com if he or she so chooses, and is still free to purchase something locally from a person who could not avoid responding to a customer's concerns.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have sent and received 1000s in amazon gift cards over the years. So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..\n\n\"\n\nI've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by \"Susan Pebley\" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.\n\nTo receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.\n\nI hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better. We hope to see you again soon.\n\nWe'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.\"\n\nOne they don't want to fix something that should be easy to fix....\"just reissue a gift card\", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients don't use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didn't work...just imagine how many gifts don't reach the recipient.\n\nvery disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.\n\nFelt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.", "label": 0}

I tried it again and it still did not work so I called Amazon Customer Service.  After talking to someone (who was easy to understand) for ten minutes she hung up on me.  Then I called back and got a lady with a very heavy accent who was super hard to understand.  I talked to this lady for over 30 minutes and had to deal with her asking the same questions over and over and not helping me at all.  I finally asked for a manager and she told me she will let him know that I want to speak to him.  After 5 minutes on hold she came back to the phone without the manager!  She told me he was busy and she did the best she could to help me and was about to hang up on me! I told her that I needed to speak to the manager and I was willing to wait.  She put me back on hold and about 2 minutes later the manager came to the phone.  After talking to the manager who did nothing to help; he told me he was going to forward this information on to the gift card department by email and they would get back to me within 24 hours.  At this point I learned the manager was just as unless as the employee in customer service and nothing was going to get done with them.  So a few hours later I got an email from the gift card department and it said ....We would best be able to help you if you call our customer service line.  ....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  At this point, I was pissed so I waited a few hours to reply in order to gather my thoughts and calm down.  About 5 hours after the gift card department replied the manager replied tell me that he sent my request and they would get back to me within 1-2 business days --- This was different information then what he told me on the phone and a delayed reply since the gift card department had replied already.  ....This story is getting too long ...so long story short after talking on the phone the next day to two more people someone finally worked out it out; it was almost not worth the 30 dollars!

I called customer service, received the same \"call your bank\" email response. I called again this time extremely frustrated. They escalated it to the gift card/escalation department. They had me prove to them that all 20 gift cards were compromised. I asked all 20 employees to take photo copies of their cards, where then I prepared a document showing all 20 card numbers with detailed explanation. In short, I had to \"work for it\" - proving that indeed, they're careless service of not checking these card numbers were recycled and unusable. When I mentioned a couple of times, \"Do you guys read your comments on how most of these gift cards have the same complaints?\" They acted clueless. Also, they only do customer service responses via email, even after repeated requests for them to call me back - they never do. You have to initiate phone contact. After over two weeks, and constant nagging on my end, I did receive the amount back, but not in the form of 20 gift cards as I originally intended to give as employee gifts, but a credit on one account.

UPS attempted to deliver my package, but I was not home. I left them a note that said, \"Please leave the package in the main office. Do not put under my mat.\" This is because my apartment building is not secure and it is open to pretty much anyone. Since my gift was a $100 gift card, I didn't want to risk anyone taking it. Unfortunately, I came home to find the package under my mat. I would like there to be some sort of option to not have packages left under mats, especially when the main office accepts packages for its residents. Thanks a lot, UPS.", "label": 2}

I ordered a $75.00 gift card that could be enclosed in a birthday card. The advertised description said the card would be delivered to my home address within 24 hours. To make a very long story shorter.....I still have not received this card 16 days after the promised delivery date. I have received 5 notices of extended delivery time. I called to cancel the order on day 14 and was told that the order could not be cancelled because it was \"on the truck\". I was promised it would definitely be delivered by the 16th day without exception. The 16th day has come and gone without the card being delivered, but I have received another extended delivery date email. After contacting Amazon customer service 3 times during this time period, I have elected to send the gift card digitally. I would have done this 16 days ago if I had any idea of the delay. Amazon said they could give me a $30.00 \"promotional\" credit on my account. Then, I was told I couldn't use the promotional credit toward the purchase of the digital gift card. Come on, Amazon, you can do better than that! Most reputable retailers would have likely refunded the full amount based on the level of inconvenience. At a minimum,the contractor for the plastic cards should have made things right. I was not allowed to talk with an Amazon supervisor to voice my complaint--and I asked numerous times.\n\nIf you want the recipient of your gift card to receive your gift, better to play it safe, and buy your gift card from another retailer. I'm still hoping that the digital gift card will reach my recipient with my apology note. Not the birthday gift I had hoped to give.", "label": 0}

I have never had a problem with either of these methods, nor have any of my card recipients.\n\nAlthough it is theoretically better etiquette to give a physical card, I've found that because Amazon is an online vendor and the cardholder is going to visit the web to use the card number, recipients enjoy the convenience of having the card information delivered to their inboxes--especially when it's on the day of a special event. If you use the printed versions, you can easily mail or hand deliver your gift with your personalization applied.\n\nIn short, make your life easier by sending joy to your loved ones through the technological magic of your computer--they truly will appreciate the sentiment behind your gift regardless of the delivery method.", "label": 1}

The teachers from last year, embarassed to have to approach my wife about it, told her that the gift cards were EMPTY and didn't work.

I used Amazon chat support, and was pleasantly surprised that they offered to refund the amounts with no hassles.  We didn't even have to recite back the codes or send the cards back (we had asked for them back from the teachers for this purpose)\n\nConclusion:  Think twice about ordering these, and consider the Amazon E-Codes as a better option.  1 star for complete product failure, and 5 stars for great customer support, averaged out and rounded up gives this transaction three stars.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Two years ago I bought a $50 gift certificate to give my sister.  I figured on Amazon she could find something that she'd like and I would not make a bad purchase thus disappointing her.  My sister didn't have an Amazon account so had to open one before she tried to purchase something.  At that time everything that she added to her cart could not be purchased because it was either not offered directly through Amazon or it was not qualified for another reason.  My sister told me of her problems and I told her to not worry to just give me the code and I would give her $50 to use on whatever she wanted.  When I tried to apply the code to my account, I discovered it was already used.  I ended up having to use my sister's account to make a purchase for myself with the $50 gift certificate.  When you apply a gift certificate (even if you don't even use it because your order was not successful!) the gift certificate amount is *fixed* to your account.  Therefore, you cannot remove it and give it to someone else.  It created a big hassle for me.  Make sure that the person you are giving it to will be able to buy something s/he wants.

{"text": "BUYER BEWARE!!!! I purchased 14 $100.00 cards directly from Amazon.com in 02/18.  The gift cards came adhered inside of Thank You cards, which were tucked into envelopes.  Each of those was then in an Amazon sealed outer envelope.  The fourteen cards were then in a sealed opaque envelope and that was in a sealed Amazon box.  My point being, the claim codes were not visible once they were shipped to me.  I handed these out to my employees in appreciation.  Over the past week, 2 employees tried to use their cards and they were \"already redeemed\".  That was the first round of hours worth of calls to Amazon support.  They credited one back to my account, which then I had to give my employee $100 to replace the card.  The other one, I received an email that they were unable to help me because it had already been redeemed.  I still had 3 unopened cards locked in the safe in my office.  These had never had the outer envelopes open.  Both came up as already redeemed. 3 more hours with support and I finally reached a supervisor that understood the issue.  The claim code compromise had to occur before they shipped since they were still in the sealed package.  She took a list of everyone I had given the cards to, looked up the serial numbers I had purchased and found that 5 of them appeared to be fictitious name accounts.  She again had to escalate me to the gift card department who again answered me with a stock email stating they cannot do anything because they have been redeemed and I will have to contact the bank that issued the card (ACI, which is part of Amazon).  No phone number given.  The link to contact them takes me right back to customer support to start this whole process over again.  $500.00 of worthless cards, that's my reward for being smart enough to order them direct rather than buy from a grocery store.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was caught off guard by this Amazon gift card purchase. During the Christmas season I purchased a three pack of gift boxed $50 Amazon gift cards - total $150. I did not ask for holiday rush as they were to be given as birthday gifts in the upcoming year. They arrived in nice packaging exactly as anticipated and set aside.  Over 60 days after the cards were purchased, literally the very day the first birthday card was to be distributed I decided to 'double check' the card was activated. I don't even know why I did it except the person whom it was intended gets 'confused' easily and wanted to be able to tell them exacting detail how to redeem the card at the Amazon website.\n\nTo my disbelief, after eight attempts of trying to activate the card it kept coming up INVALID. I immediately emailed customer service and instantly alerted to call Customer Service. No Customer Service phone number was provided but did a 'Google Search' to find the number.  Nina answered the Customer Service line, she was very pleasant and assuring she would handle my problem. I appreciated GREATLY not being transferred from one person to another which also assured me Amazon is a reliable business. After about 30 minutes which was mostly silence where Nina appears to been reviewing the initial purchase order and subsequent processing of the order Nina assured me the card was now activated. She said one card was credited to my buyer account for immediate use and the problem solved. Nina also verified the other two cards were also now activated and as I requested she would email me confirmation of all three cards activation. I didn't really want to  know what had happened. I assume 'mistakes happen'. It was taken care of and it was done in a way that was professional and instantaneous.  I am completely satisfied.\n\nHowever from my experience I now would advise any person buying gift cards\n1. Don't buy them singularly, purchase at least one extra for your own use to validate its activation immediately upon receipt.\n2. Keep meticulous records of any gift card purchase until it has been redeemed, even if it means questioning the recipient several times after it was given out  -  keep track of the card until it has been used at least one time.\n3.  I live in a very safe and relatively crime free community however during the 2013 holidays season several young men were known to have gone down my street late at night examining mail box contents looking for cards with cash or gift cards. This information was validated by the local police department but I didn't know about it until several weeks later - after the gift cards had been ordered and successfully delivered. Obviously Amazon i keeps all customers updated on any package arrival plus I have Amazon Smartphone notifications when any Amazon package is delivered to my home. I am always careful to go to the mailbox immediately  upon a package delivery. It is worth noting this holiday season Amazon offered free overnight delivery of gift cards . . . which I declined but upon retrospect it was likely an option I should of used as it would of provided additional insurance the cards arrive safely.\n\nI would definitely recommend Amazon for any gift card purchase.\n- The Amazon site listed multiple local businesses the average Amazon customer may be unaware of.\n- Amazon don't just sell their own card and nation wide store gift cards - they also have gift cards for stores that usually don't normally offer gift cards like Whole Foods. When I presented the Whole Foods gift card to the local cashier she said she had never even seen a Whole Foods gift card before and had to call the Manager to help her . . .  and the Manager had never seen one either\n- Also when you place an order for some gift cards selections they are sent from the corporate offices not Amazon so there is a slight delay in the processing of these orders.\n\nHOWEVER there is a degree of risk with gift cards I was that unaware of.  I thought I was careful and yet I still caught off guard.  Hope this review and the general comments on gift card purchases helps.", "label": 2}

After all, you get all the perks that an ECA membership has to offer like 10% off all game purchases at Amazon.com, er, wait, no...they got rid of that, all for free!\n\nWell, it seemed like a great deal and many gamers joined at the time with the understanding that turning off the memnbership's \"auto-renew\" feature would be as easy as the radio button in the member's area of the website. Turns out, the ECA has decided that the \"auto renew\" option should never have been on the site in the first place and that the only way to cancel a subscription is to snail-mail your request. Furthermore, they can't guarantee your mailed-in request won't be misplaced so be sure to fork over the dough for certified mail. Finally, if you think you're safe because the card you used is soon to expire, don't think so fast, the ECA has decided that it is within it's rights in changing the expiration date you submitted and re-runing the transaction. What's all this mean? It means that without jumping through hoops, your card could be charged indefinitely for an ECA membership...I really hope the word gets out about this.\n\nThe irony of a consumer advocate group pulling stunts like this is almost too good to be true.", "label": 0}

The first time I went to use these reward gift cards to purchase an item here I was told the reward gift cards weren't recognized. The second time I tried I got the same result. No other explanation. A quick call to customer service and the explanation that you can't use a rewards card to purchase anything other than a Amazon gift card. This it seems is also the case when someone gives you a Visa, Master Card and American Express gift card. With the size of Amazon's computer systems you would think they could figure a way to accept gift cards for anything other than another gift card. Next time little Timmy or Suzi gives you a major credit card remember that if you want to use it at Amazon, you have no choice other than buying a Amazon gift card. For you folks who are purchasing a gift card from one of the major credit card companies, just purchase a Amazon gift card. Could that be the method for this madness?", "label": 2}

I can see from the reviews that this is a VERY common problem, and Amazon, you're ending up with customer's money without them getting a product in exchange.  I know that's good for the 'ol profit margin, but I can't believe you operate that way.  So... you'd better find out what the problem is and FIX IT.

The reply I received from Amazon was that the Kindle Gift Card can only be used for Kindle-related purchases, NOT for Amazon general merchandise. I tried to take the card back to Best Buy to exchange it for a regular Amazon gift card (which is what she asked for from the sales associate, so apparently, even retailers are unaware of this policy, although when I returned the manager knew this probably because others were trying to return their Kindle gift cards). Anyway, the manager there said it cannot be returned or exchanged, and confirmed it can only be used to make Kindle-related purchases. He said this is an Amazon return policy, not a Best Buy policy.\n\nNow the real question is, why would anyone in their right mind want an Amazon Kindle Gift Card with all these limitations, when they could get a regular Amazon gift card and buy anything at the Amazon store, including Kindle related purchases. This is a ridiculous policy, and if anyone says I'm lying, I'll be happy to forward the e-mail I received from Amazon customer service concerning this issue.\n\n*** UPDATE: Someone from Amazon called me to say if I first put the Amazon Kindle Gift Cards into my account using the number before making a purchase the money should be available for other purchases. They also sent me an e-mail with more specific instructions. Not sure if this is a rule change or what, but I appreciate them taking the time out to call me and leave another e-mail. I'll post the new e-mail below with the instructions (the first e-mail telling me it cannot be used this way is in the comments discussion to this review). Kudos to Amazon for listening to their customers if this is true (And I assume it is). I have not used the cards yet, and hadn't even scratched the off the cover over the numbers because I was thinking about trying to have Amazon exchange them for regular Amazon gift cards. Anyway, I'll bump up my rating to 3 stars (minus 2 for the misinformation) and the new e-mail is below:\n\nHello Bill,\n\nI'm sorry for the misinformation you have previously received in an email from us about using your Gift Card for purchases on Amazon.com. I've tried contacting you at the phone number listed in your Amazon.com account but have been unsuccessful.\n\nTo use an Amazon.com Gift Card (or a Gift Card with the Kindle name on it) for purchases from Amazon.com, visit Your Account (http://www.amazon.com/your-account) and look for the gift card option in the Payments section.\n\nYou can also enter your gift card claim code during checkout in the box labeled \"Have any gift cards, gift certificates or promotional claim codes?\" in the right column. If you use 1-Click ordering, you'll find a similar option if you click \"Review or edit your 1-Click orders\" after clicking \"Buy now with 1-Click\" on a product's page.\n\nYou'll find more instructions here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/help/giftcards\n\nIf you still need help, you can contact us via phone, chat, or e-mail by clicking the \"Contact Us\" button on any Help page (http://www.amazon.com/help).\n\nI hope this helps! We look forward to seeing you again soon.\n\nMegan", "label": 2}

My wife was upset and called Amazon and after a little bit of getting passed on to a couple people they said they would reissue the card and gift certificate. Second time it came packaged in a flat cardboard box undamaged. Delivered by UPS. Made it on time. If it would have been done the correct way the first time there would have been no problem.

{"text": "The funny thing about this book is that the title seems so strange, but the synopsis I read about the book sounded really fun and interesting and it did not disappoint.\nThe story intricately weaves the story of Hank & Delilah starting from their childhoods until they meet and fall in love as adults.  Hank is your stand-up all-around good guy and a district attorney.  Delilah is the woman he falls in love with and of course, a bank robber.  That doesnt stop the intense attraction the two feel.\nI really loved the back stories on the characters and how it impacts them throughout their lives.  Their love story is adorable and complicated.  They manage to work through it to be together, but not without interference's from family, friends, the devil and of course, some poisoned root beer.\nI really enjoyed the story, but I have two issues with it. One, the title  it almost seems off-putting.  Once you find out why the title is what it is, it makes sense, but its not a typical contemporary romance title, but then again, this isn't your typical contemporary romance.  The second thing that made me more confused than anything, were the multiple names the characters had, along with the voluminous amount of characters in general.  Again, it made sense for the story, but that definitely did not help me get less confused at certain points in the book!  Overall, the book is funny and sweet and well worth your time.\n\n~Dedicated Ink LR's Review", "label": 2}

If a merchant falls into a certain category the card will not cover the purchase-even if you are directed to the merchant.  ALSO, I attempted to purchase an ITOUCH as a gift and in the promotion, I was given a $25 Amazon gift card.  I attempted to make the purchase with a $200 gift card I had previously purchased from Amazon.  Since the promotion forced me to take the $25 gift card, I was not allowed to use my $200 gift card for the purchase.  I was not aware of this until they billed my credit card company.  After 3 hours on the phone with people I had difficulty understanding, I was forced to send back the ITOUCH I originally purchased, turn in the $25 gift card and repurchase the ITOUCH with my $200 gift card.  I should also mention that when I repurchased the ITOUCH the price went up.

So now, I should mail the card back to my aunt so she can go to the store, get it activated, and then send it back to me? EXCUSE ME! That is ridiculous, even a dog would understand how ridiculous that is.  They kept telling me this is my only option. I told them to send a refund to my aunt and an apology letter. I will never be using amazon.com ever again until they send me and my aunt an apology. Absolutely ridiculous, very poor customer service.

{"text": "As others have mentioned, the ECA is a shady organization masquerading under the guise of an advocacy group for gaming rights and first amendment protections for videogames.  Initially, the group offered a number of benefits as perks for membership, but of those, many are offers that you can get on one's own at any time (such as a free trial of Gamefly).  The best perks have been dropped.\n\nThe greater problem is that in order to activate membership, you are required to provide a credit card number, even for a pre-purchased membership or a free membership (given through various promotions). They make it very easy to become a member.  However, they make it nearly impossible to stop being a member.  The ECA charges regular fees that you cannot get out of unless you cancel your member ship through a very specific form of WRITTEN correspondence (no e-mail or website help at all), and well in advance of your membership due date.\n\nIf you have recently become a member, I suggest you begin the proceedings to cancel now, and keep multiple copies of everything you send and receive.  You might just get out of your contract by 2011.", "label": 0}

However, what's the deal with only being able to use an Amazon.com Gift Card on Amazon.com?  Why not Amazon.co.uk?\n\nThis may sound nit-picky, but consider this- just after Christmas, on Amazon.co.uk there was a sale- the \"Twelve Days of Kindle\" sale.  Loads of Kindle Books for real cheap.  I got excited, browsed through, chose which ones I was going to use my gift card on, and was set to check out.  Looking at the check out page, though, I realized I wasn't going to be able to use the gift card, as it was only good on the US Amazon, not the UK Amazon.\n\nI'm not ungrateful- $100 of free books is great, even if there are limitations.  But why do those limitations exist?  It's the same company, just a different country.  I haven't really looked into the legal complications, so perhaps there's a good reason why they legally can't allow us to use both sites.  However, to a layman just using the site, it seems a bit unfair that although I'm allowed to buy products from the two (separate, yes, yet identical down to, for all intents and purposes, the logo) sites using the same log-in name, I can't use my gift card on both.\n\nLike I said, maybe it's nit-picky.

{"text": "We were trying to save trees and hassle for people who wanted to give us gift cards.  We assumed, like everything else on Amazon, that this process would be easy and convenient.

It was harder than it seems like it should have been to receive the gift cards\n3.  The emails to redeem the gift cards did not work more than half of the time.\n\nTo expand on #2, I don't know why a wedding registry linked to my Amazon account could not just automatically deposit the gift card balance onto my Amazon account.  The process is that you get an email sent to your email address and then you redeem the gift card using the code in your email.  Although inefficient and mildly annoying, this process would be fine if it worked consistently.\n\nHowever, in more than half of the instances where people bought us these cards, it did not work; we did not receive the emails with the proper codes in them even though we received a note from Amazon saying that a gift card had been purchased.  Granted, the times that it didn't go through could have been due to our guests mis-typing our email address.  But even though we could see that the guests bought us the gift card, there is nothing we could do on our side to get the credit according to Amazon support.\n\nSo we were left in the unenviable position of having to contact our guests and have THEM deal with Amazon customer service to get the problem resolved, which is mildly embarrassing.\n\nThe customer service guy I talked to said that privacy was the reason that these could not be directly linked to our Amazon account, but it seemed that this would be by far the most efficient way to redeem these cards.  I'm guessing this inefficient process is at least partially intentional so that at least part of the gift cards purchased do not get redeemed, making Amazon more money.

{"text": "My father just ordered for me an Amazon.com gift certificate (February 2010). He has not used Amazon.com gift certificates since 2008 because they screwed it up - sent a confirmation, never sent the certificate number, said they did, it was never received - this went on for two months until it was straightened out in October 2008. Well, what I am reviewing is the supposed gift certificate verification sent in February of 2010 - for the October 2008 gift certificate!! When he called, they had no record of this order on file. Several phone calls later, he got someone who was all apologetic, gave him a direct phone number, and said if I still want it, she will be sure it is done correctly. He gave me the option of his trying again - but I DON'T trust that it will work. After this last screw-up, I don't trust Amazon.com to get it right. And I don't want to waste any more of my father's time, so I think I'll go elsewhere.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I decided to give my grandma this email gift card for Christmas and the image never showed up in the email to my grandma.  I had my grandma forward the email to me and it wouldn't show up in my yahoo account either.  I then forwarded the email to my husband's account and it didn't show the image under his email provider either.  The image is what has the claim code, the message I typed, and the amount of the gift card.  I would do this again if Amazon would have an alternative so that the information would should outside of the image incase you can't view the image.", "label": 0}
