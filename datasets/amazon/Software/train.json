My Gammy and I have hated each other ever since I borrowed her car years ago and lost it in a street race where I had to bet the car itself.  1981 Lincoln Town Cars can't drift at all! I could have died! I never forgave Gammy for writing me out of her will as a stupid revenge ploy.  Fortunately, after a brief stint in jail I was able to trade her jewelery to my buddy Carlos for a copy of Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011! I cleverly waited for her dementia to rob her of her ability to speak so that she couldn't rat me out to the rest of my family (who have also never respected my street racing talents). Then I went to work. WillMaker Plus has an excellent tutorial that helped me create exactly the type of will that I believe Gammy would have wanted! I know that she would have wanted to repay me for her past selfishness with her entire estate!\n\nBut that's not all. Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011 is SO easy to use, my old demented Gammy was able to use it to CHANGE this will to make her cat, Mr. Bojangles, the sole beneficiary of her estate! That's right, a 92 year old woman with dementia using a computer program successfully! Have you ever heard of something so ridiculous? I think not! WillMaker Plus 2011 is THAT easy! It took me two months but I was finally able to convince her that Mr. Bojangles was the secret leader of the evil elves that have been trying to poison her food. The estate is mine once again and Mr. Bojangles is history! Maybe Mr. Bojangles should have picked up a copy of WillMaker too, if you catch my drift. Hahaha.

However, if you have been become accustomed to Gnome1.4 or KDE3 (my preference), you may be disappointed.  Frankly, I like the look of KDE3 and the options (e.g. translucent menus).  RH also hacked it to make double-click the default action for KDE.  Also, Konquerer is not on the panel, although it can be invoked from the command line, but it doesn't display the tree navigation by default.\nAdministration is simpler and more powerful now (e.g. changing XF86 settings without manually editing the text file), but the mp3 patent prompted RH to remove mp3 support from XMMS and Noatun.  A novice user would not know how to download xmms, compile, and install it.\nI think that RH truly is targeting the corporate customers.  With Windows, you only have one interface out of the box (other shells have been created but none have become prevalent, and most users don't even know that).  By RH tweaking Gnome and KDE to what appears to be a unified desktop, the typical mindless corporate customer won't become \"confused\" by choices - \"Which one should I use?  Which is better, KDE or Gnome?\".  Those questions are avoided with RH's approach.  Savvy users will feel constrained.\nI went back to RH7.3 after trying 8.0.  Granted, 8.0 is faster because of the O(1) scheduler (order of one, for those not familiar with algorithm efficiency).

To this end, they're repackaging altered versions of standard programming languages that only work with other Microsoft products.\nIn short, if you build your site with FrontPage, the site will always be a FrontPage web site.

I liked Bloats as the villain name, since it seemed like a programmer in-joke.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is slow, ironically including the mudball game.

It's kind of like a bunch of unskippable cutscenes. This adds to the feeling of grinding. The frog game is particularly bad at this. So are the mirror and bubble ones, and you can't skip that leg. You can only send Zoombinis through the mirror one at a time. You can send them through the bubbles more than one at a time, but they might collide and get sent back, which adds to the frustration.\n\nThe fleen game is the only one I find challenging, maybe also the caverns at a higher level. I can never seem to survive them with a full batch of 16. You need to get through a whole leg with a full batch of 16 to level up, which was frustrating for me wanting to get right to a higher level.\n\nEven with eight sets of twins and leaving most traits the same, you have to change a couple traits. Even so, this makes the games that care about Zoombini traits ridiculously easy. I often make an all random batch at Zoombini Isle, partially to save time and partially for more challenge in the Zoombini traits games.\n\nOne side of cliffs or caverns accepts one variety of the characteristic in question and the other side takes all other version of that characteristics.

Also, the caverns have you figure this out for two sets of pairs instead of just one.\n\nI have an old version of the CDROM, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis Deluxe, dated 1996.

{"text": "****NOTE: If you want to skip the long version, jump to the bottom for a short summary.****\n\n****Long Version****\nMy wife and are are busy professionals with very different schedules. We've come to see time as a valuable commodity and needed to have a calendar experience that could be shared across all of our devices. We were both very familiar with Outlook, so we researched Office 365. Given the cloud functionality, OneDrive with 1TB each, and regular updates to the newest versions, it seemed like the best option for us. I use a PC at home and a ThinkPad for work when I travel. She uses a Macbook Air and an iMac. Little did we know that Microsoft has decided to stop supporting (or at least poorly support) their Mac products.\n\nI received the product key in the mail, started it up, and downloaded everything into my PC first. I set up both of our webapp accounts and shared some calendars. I then started working on her iMac next. This is where I ran into a problem. After a couple hours of trying, I just could not find a way to cloudshare anything between my PC, our webapps, and her Outlook account.\n\nI figured that it was some problem on my end. I'm used to troubleshooting things, so I started working on it. After spending another 3-4 hours on it myself unsuccessfully, I finally decided to contact Microsoft. Know that I fully updated everything and explored the online tech support. First, I was directed by an online chat tech to the phone support line. There, I was told that they NO LONGER have a tech support phone line. That's right, if you buy a Microsoft product for your Apple products, you are a second class citizen. You no long have access to a live person!\n\nAs for what Mac tech support was available, she first directed me to a site that no longer worked. When I explained this, she carefully spelled it out again (as if I couldn't figure it out), then seemed surprised it still didn't work. She had to troubleshoot this, before finally finding the NEW Mac support site.\n\nThe new site mostly contained things I had already found. Microsoft basically continued to lead me to believe that there was some way to make all of this work between a Mac and a PC.  Eventually, I had to go to the community forums. After about an hour of searching there, I discovered that there is no way to do what the product says it does. Office 365 CANNOT share with iMacs or Macbooks. You get an older, outdated product that somehow is advertised as \"new.\" Basically, its Office 2011 for Mac, which we already purchased for her three years ago! The WHOLE REASON we bought Office 365 to begin with was to have products that could work together among my Windows PC and Thinkpad and her iMac and Macbook\n\nThis borders on false advertising. Its appalling that there is no explanation of this anywhere, not even on the Microsoft website. They do not tell their support team this and I doubt their sales team knows either.  After some searching, I did find out that we could spend additional money ($4 a month) to own our own Exchange account to make this work. That is the only way. I'm debating just biting the bullet, but it would make me more angry to let them extort more money out of money to use an inferior product that I already paid for previously.\n\n****SUMMARY****\nMacs get an inferior product from four years ago as a part of Office 365 that has no cloud functionality. If you want to do what Office 365 says it does, with Macs AND PCs, you need to pay more money ($4 a month) to rent your own exchange server for each person with a Mac account. Thus, this will cost you at least $196 a year, rather than the $100 Office365 advertises. Basically, THIS DOES NOT SHARE WITH MACS", "label": 0}

It really breaks things down and doesn't just tell you \"This means that.\" but also explains \"(Why) This means that.\" When learning about verbs and other particles such as 'wa', 'wo', 'ni', the programs takes great strides to explain how they attach to words, and how they are used in various situations and sentences.\n\nThe only problem I have with this program so far is that there isn't much it tries to do to help you remember anything. The few games it has at the end of some chapters are not very useful. You'll have to make your own methods or get some flashcards to memorize vocabulary.

Although overall this is a fairly decent attempt by Microsoft to make something asthetically pleasing and Mac like, it is hampered by the usual Microsoft problems:\n\n1. It keeps 'helping' you when you don't want it to.  Although you can presumably turn most of these features off you probably won't have the time or inclination to find out how to.  So you'll have the pleasure of being confronted by offers to create Powerpoint slides when you open up Word, have brackets turned into smilies as well as a host of other random edits and substitutions that are correct maybe 10% of the time.\n\n2. It is bloated with features most of which still don't work correctly.  I would say this is slightly worse than the Windows version.  For instance, the bulleting and numbering seems to go wrong or randomly switch between styles more often and the styles and header numbering is even less stable.\n\nIn addition to these standard MS problems they've managed to make the whole thing run really very slowly.  I'm using a G4 Powerbook and Word cannot even always keep up with my moderate touch typing speed (i.e. there is a noticable lag between typing and words appearing).

{"text": "When reviewing software, nothing ruins the experience more quickly than a failed installation.  I encountered two installation problems with WillMaker: 1) Clicking the 'Register your product' button takes me to Nolo's page for buying the 2013 edition of WillMaker, and instructions for registering the 2011 product are nowhere to be seen; 2) Clicking the 'Web Update' button that offers to download updates for the 2011 version installs files that break the program's ability to launch.\n\nGranted, I am reviewing and installing the 2011 edition of WillMaker, and the current version is for 2013.  That being said, the online notification assured me that 2011 online updates would be available to me through the end of 2012 (and the installer does indeed install something, albeit a bad something).  I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and hit the same failure twice.  I uninstalled again, then reinstalled without requesting the online update.  This worked.  Still, I view this to be a huge black eye for the product.  Additional salt was rubbed into my wound when I followed the link for a free online living trust that is advertised on the box.  I instead received a notification that the offer had expired (despite the fact that no expiration date is listed anywhere on the packaging).\n\nWillMaker then offered to help me create a bunch of documents, and estate planning documents like a will are only one category of what is offered.  Being offered documents beyond the expected estate planning documents is not a negative, but was somewhat confusing given the program's name.  I guess this is what puts the \"plus\" into WillMaker Plus.  Perusing the box, I see that these extra documents are indeed part of the promised functionality, therefore, no marks off for my (brief) confusion here.\n\nI then jumped into the meat of what I assume most customers want from WillMaker, i.e., the wizard that helps one to create a will.  You are presented with a checklist outline that explains what the process will be, and then you are walked through a series of dialogs which query you for your personal information and desires for your will.  Each page has a right pane with additional information for each question that you need to answer.  Everything seemed straightforward here, so high marks for the data entry aspect of WillMaker.\n\nAfter answering all the questions, you are presented with an on-screen draft of your will which you may subsequently print.  The on-screen instructions explain that you need to sign it with two witnesses to make it legally binding.  I have to accept on faith that the legal quality of this will is sufficient to cause my estate wishes to be executed according to my desires.  It seems to me that the prudent consumer would pay an estate lawyer to review the job done by WillMaker.  I also suspect that there are free online boilerplates that would allow me to craft a similar document.\n\nAnother area of uncertainty for me is the trade offs between a living trust and a will.  Granted, WillMaker is designed to create a will, not a trust.  But if we ignore the semantic implications of the product name, what the consumer really wants from this product are the documents that control the disposition of one's property after death.  To not devote even one yes/no question to \"do you perhaps need a trust rather than a will?\" seems like a serious flaw to me.\n\nIn summary, I found WillMaker Plus 2011 to be underwhelming despite receiving it for free via Amazon Vine.  The installation problems are totally unacceptable.  And the final output document leaves me feeling like I need to visit an estate lawyer to review the result.  If the price of WillMaker plus the cost of reviewing a WillMaker-generated set of documents is less than having the estate lawyer create the same set of documents from scratch, then this product pays for itself.  But that's a pretty big if.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have used Pinnacle Video editing software professionally for several years.  My experience with Pinnacle has been positive and I have produced a lot of work with their software.  I think Pinnacle has really pioneered video editing for home use as well.  Indeed I'm quite familiar with their versions of Studio 7, 8, 9 and 9 plus.  I recently purchased their STUDIO MediaSuite for home use.  It seemed like a nice package to have video, audio and photo editing all in one.  Actually, I didn't need the photo editing because I use Adobe's Photoshop Elements (a really solid piece of software).\n\nThe short answer is that the video component works quite well.  The interface is easy to understand and use.  I'm sure most folks would be up and running in no time.  Don't forget to check their web site for product updates.\n\nThe sound editing capability is another story.  Pinnacle has (apparently) licensed Steinberg WaveLab Lite as the audio editor.  WaveLab Lite is a home version of its more robust professional software.  The first big problem I ran into using WaveLab is that it has no ability to rip CDs.  None.  This is quite surprising since that is one of the claims Pinnacle makes for this software on the outside of the box.  So if you purchase MediaSuite you will have to purchase a separate software for ripping CDs.  The second problem is that neither Pinnacle nor Steinberg will support WaveLab Lite.  This makes a certain kind of business logic sense Steinberg doesn't sell it and Pinnacle doesn't own it.  Yet it's an orphaned software that no one will claim as their own and will not support.  So be forewarned that if you purchase MediaSuite then you are on your own if you have any problems with it.\n\nOther than that, this seems to be a fairly good product all in all.", "label": 2}

In process of starting the will it suggested that if I was intending on making a living trust that I do the trust first.  Fine.  When I did the install originally it placed a \"Free Nolo Online Trust\" icon on my desktop, so I clicked that, then had to register, etc.  But I kept getting a screen where it wanted to charge me the retail price for the \"free trust\".  I tried a variety of things to rectify the problem, including sending an email to them.  I didn't get a response, so I used their online chat.  They had to enter my free registration directly from their end to get it to work.  So if you have the same problem, that's what you'll have to do.  It works fine now.  Included with the software is a little book \"Your Little Legal Companion\".  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It seemed more like an attempt at humor rather than a serious guide to help you through legal problems.

The part where you actually make the will is surprisingly easy and straightforward.  But, and this is not any fault of the publisher, you need to expect to do an enormous amount of background reading on each topic, topics which are available for you at each step of the process in the software. Actually, that is perfectly reasonable since you don't have an attorney sitting across a table from you guiding you and understanding your background. You need to educate yourself on the pertinent laws and ramifications of the choices available to you before you make your will.

{"text": "The current trend for software companies is to provide \"software as a service\" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time.  There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n\nInstallation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm a sole practitioner CPA and maintain about 20 separate sets of clients' books in my office.  Since both Intuit and Peachtree have \"professional advisors programs\" which aggressively solicit CPAs to shill for their software, I should also state that I'm in no way affiliated with either of them, nor any other software company (the fact that I must mention this demonstrates where the accounting profession is headed, but that's another story).\nI realize that I'm swimming upstream here, but, in a word, I detest Quickbooks.  My clients who use it routinely bring me sets of books which they have messed up so badly that I run up big fees unraveling their errors.  The reason, in short, is that Quickbooks is not a legitimate double-entry self-balancing accounting package.  I believe that it's merely a dressed-up, aggressively marketed version of Intuit's checkbook program, Quicken.  Because of this, it's far too easy to make serious errors which the software will not detect.  Just one example: A single push of a button will convert your books from cash basis to accrual basis.  A client brought me his books which had a cash-basis balance sheet, an accrual-basis P&L, journals and ledgers which were some of both - and he had no idea why nothing balanced (if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's all the more reason to avoid this software)!  I keep a current version of Quickbooks on my computer ONLY as an accommodation to my clients who refuse to switch.\nBoth Intuit and Peachtree have rotten tech support. Both gouge their customers mercilessly for annual payroll updates.  Nevertheless, I do my best to get my clients to start with, or to switch to, Peachtree.  It's by no means a perfect solution, but it's at least a \"real\" double-entry system, therefore much more idiot-proof, more powerful, and generally bug-free. The learning curves of the two programs are now roughly equal, since Peachtree  has added an optional interface for non-accountants.\nFinally, I'm not bashing the company, just this product.  I've been using Intuit's professional tax return preparation software (ProSeries) for many years, and I'm completely satisfied with it. But my bottom-line professional opinion here is that Quickbooks is simply not what it claims to be.  Use Peachtree, use MYOB, use ACCPAC Simply Accounting - any of which are preferable to this over-hyped and under-powered dog of an accounting program.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have a graduate degree in Spanish and spent quite a lot of time developing interesting material to present to my undergraduate students but have little experience in teaching children, so I was excited about finding a program to further my daughter's knowledge of the language.  The Rosetta Stone Homeschool Spanish (Spain) program is very well designed and teaches both the spoken and written language in a way that provides useful vocabulary in real situations.  There is a lot of reinforcement through images and repetition.  I do find occasional problems with editing where the written statement is not the same as the spoken one, plus some typos.  There are also a few grammatical points that I have issues with, but they do have to do with the evolution of the language (I say 'adnde' in Spanish, but I don't say 'whence,' so I guess that I shouldn't complain.)  The main problem with this program is that it's boring.  Some friends have asked about whether or not they should use it with their kids, and I've had to warn them that most children won't be able to handle more than 15 minutes a day.  My daughter started out very excited, doing 45 minutes on the first day, then quickly got tired of it.  If you can, form a play group that does games and music together in Spanish to support what your child can get out of Rosetta Stone.  This course provides a base, but it's definitely not a complete answer to language acquisition.", "label": 1}

I'm an old Parson's Technology MoneyCounts user that reluctantly moved to Quicken when Intuit bought MoneyCounts.  I have difficulty with the way Intuit does business after using TurboTax this year.  My experience with all their products has been going downhill.  I thought MS Money might be the solution.  It does have some features that I really like better, and it affords a lot more flexibility than Quicken, not forcing you to use the blind accounts that Quicken sets up for 401(k), investments, etc.  After several tries, I was able to import, but it seems to work best using a backup file.  However, many transactions did not import properly.  Fortunately, it's early enough in the year that I was able to clean up the current year, and I pretty much ignored past years, so prior to 2006 there are a huge number of transactions sitting in uncatagorized accounts.  I'm going to run this in parallel for a month or two, but my guess is I'll reluctantly stick with Quicken.  If you're not an accountant, either product is probably fine, depending on what you want to do with it.

This means you can't straighten out photos you took while holding the camera sideways without recompressing the image and consequently throwing away image data in the process.  I find this deeply disturbing, since every other image manager I've used has this feature, even freeware apps.\n2) No auto-rotate.  This means that you can't just use the information your camera puts in the .jpg file to have the software automatically re-orietent pictures taken while the camera was sideways.  Ever upload 50 or 100 pictures at once to your computer?  If so, you probably won't appreciate having to rotate them one at a time to the proper orientation.\n3) No thumbnail update.  This one takes the cake.  If you alter a picture in another image program (perhaps to avoid the two problems above!) then the thumbnail shown will NOT be updated.  I called MS about this and the best they told me was to delete the .POD database file.

{"text": "I was extremely pleased with this training video. The video player was very full featured; far better than any I have used in other video training I have used. Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.)\n\nIt will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too.\n\nThe Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book.\n\nThe DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled \"The Photograper's Eye\" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good, although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in  Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD.\n\nI have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with \"What's New in LR3\" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings.\n\nIf you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit. All you bookmarks are available from one of the tabs at the top... a really nice feature!\n\nIf you truly are a Lightroom beginner, this DVD will get you up-and-running quickly.

{"text": "I have used many versions of Quicken over the years, upgrading regularly, but stopped at Quicken 2002 after seeing 2003, 2004, and 2005 get panned on this site and elsewhere.\n\nHowever, Intuit has backed me into a corner by discontinuing support for 2002 as of April, so had to decide between this and Money, which is also universally panned.  Better the devil you know that the devil you don't, so Quicken 2005 it was.\n\nBefore getting into the software, let me mention that Quicken's \"sunset policy\" is garbage.  It is one thing to quit supporting a product--you cannot find good people that want to help consumers with old software.  However, to actually turn off functionality?  That is inexcusable.  If class action lawsuits were not a complete waste of time for everyone but the lawyers, I'd be out there drumming up a list of victims of this exceptionally poor business practice.\n\nThat aside, on to the software itself...  I originally thought it wasn't that bad.\n\nI have over fifty different accounts, including banking, loans, investment, 401(k), etc., etc., and they all upgraded perfectly.  I was also given the option to merge my linked investment and cash accounts, which simplifies tracking (a nice new feature for those of us who are not hardcore accountants).\n\nThe user interface is slightly different than previously, but not radically so, and allows more flexible customization.  With very little effort, I was able to get rid of most of the annoying \"buy our products\" links Intuit insists on including.\n\nHowever, a month of use has brought forth some problems that are making me strongly consider going back to a spreadsheet.  Some examples:\n\n--There are a number of hard-coded rules to prevent you from doing something Quicken does not think is a good idea.  For example, it is not possible to transfer securities from one account to another at all unless the accounts are of the same type-if not, as in the case of transfer from an ESPP account to a normal brokerage account, you need to \"sell\" the shares, then transfer the proceeds, then \"buy\" the shares in the destination account. I would say that rules out the possibility of using Quicken for tax purposes.\n\n--Upgraded 401(k) accounts for those accounts that do not provide the number of shares simply cease to function.  The first time that you attempt to use the Update Wizard to indicate your new account value, Quicken creates COPIES of all the existing securities, appends \"-401k\" to the end, and shows double the value of the account.  You cannot delete the old transactions, as you would lose all transaction history.  An hour of technical support resulted in the following brilliant suggestion:  \"Uninstall 2005 and reinstall your 2002 version, then re-enter all the transactions in the account (six years' worth), and upgrade again.  That might solve it.\"\n\n--In general, 401(k) accounts no longer provide accurate information.  When updating the account from a statement, Quicken no longer creates automatic buys based on your new balance.  Instead it creates bizarre \"placeholder entries\" that show that on Day X, you owned Y shares of something, but not how the shares got there.  Apparently, it is intended that the user now goes back and manually creates the buy transactions that were created automatically in the past.\n\n--When attempting a download from my bank, every transaction that I had before the upgrade to 2005 comes back over and over again.  For example, I attempted to download my bank transactions from the past month and received every transaction since the account was opened.  Hoping for a one-time glitch (surely once I cleared them out it would not happen again!), I spent a half hour right-clicking and deleting the duplicate transactions.  On my next download request, all 487 of them came back.\n\n--If you hold shares in an ESPP account, the name of the security has \"ESPP\" appended to the end of it, so it is treated as a different security than any shares of the same actual stock you may already hold (even if the shares are in the same account, and were placed there before an upgrade).  So instead of showing 1000 shares of XYZ, you get 500 shares of XYZ and 500 shares of XYZ ESPP.\n\nIn summary, Intuit has extorted their customers into upgrading.  Having done so, they did not fix any of the obvious software problems (why does the cash flow forecast choke when one has too many schedule transactions, but is perfectly happy to estimate how much money you will be spending???).  At the same time, they introduced a number of rather obvious bugs.  They provide pay-only support (other than for a very limited number of issue types that they will address on Web Chat if you live in the Pacific Time Zone or are willing to work on your problem at night).  The consistent approach to support is \"uninstall the software and reinstall it and re-enter all your work.\"\n\nThis is a very, very poor piece of software, and a very poor company.  It is a shame Microsoft or someone else cannot get their act together and make something better.  A spreadsheet or pen/paper would be better than this.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Pantone ColorVision Spyder2 is a monitor calibration and profiling tool that helps you match the colors displayed on your LCD or CRT monitor to those printed on a photo printer.  It includes a hardware colorimeter that measures the \"color temperature\" of the monitor and associated software utility.\n\nFirst off, do you need such a tool?  The answer is a definite yes if you work with digital images a lot.  An incorrectly calibrated monitor makes photo editing an exercise in frustration, as the color you see on screen never matches the color you get on your printer.  So calibration and profiling are necessary.  On the other hand, if you rarely do any photo editing or use any application that's color-critical, you won't need a tool like this at all; just set the monitor to levels that you find comfortable.\n\n(Calibration sets the monitor to display accurate, or close to accurate, colors, so red looks red and blue looks blue and white looks white.  Profiling helps match the monitor settings with the printer settings so when you print, you get consistent colors and highlights/shadows.)\n\nTo use the Spyder2, you first install the driver and utility, then connect the colorimeter via USB.  You then run a wizard that walks you through the process step-by-step.\n\nWhile the product works and has improved the looks of photos on my LCD, it's rather poorly designed in terms of user friendliness.  For example, this version does NOT work on multiple monitors.  It only calibrates the monitor that's connected to the primary port of the video card.  Even if you switch primary/secondary via Windows (an easy feat in Display Properties), it won't recognize the other monitor.\n\n(My workaround is to calibrate one monitor, turn off the PC and the monitors, switch the two monitors on the video card, turn everything back on, and calibrate the other monitor.)\n\nThe calibration process itself takes a lot of patience.  The hardware colorimeter is very slow in taking readings off the screen, but the main problem lies with the calibration-profiling wizard.  The font is tiny, making it hard to see.  The explanation is never clear, making you wonder what exactly you're doing.  Brightness and contrast are not calibrated; instead, you are instructed to leave them at factory default, which is usually too high for comfort.  The worst is there's no indication of progress of the colorimeter, just an hourglass icon.  When I first used this I thought it had crashed.  Also, instead of giving you the full details on how to adjust color temperature, the wizard just encourages you experiment with the monitor controls.  This complexity, plus the slow speed of the colorimeter, makes adjusting a dual-monitor setup a total pain in the ass.  (You'll have to write down all the information from one monitor by hand, then try to adjust the other monitor to match these values.)\n\nThe package includes a slim installation guide written in a dozen languages -- and it's printed in tiny font and leaves out much useful information.  There's no electronic user's guide, to my surprise.  For example, there's a program called ProfileChooser but there's no documentation at all on what it does.  When I launch it, it shows me some info but doesn't seem to do anything useful.\n\nSummary: if you do a lot of digital imaging work, this is a must-have as it allows you to objectively calibrate your monitor.  If you have a multiple-monitor setup, consider the more expensive Spyder2PRO package, which should support such a setup.  Overall the basic Spyder2 package is not a good value, but a necessary expense for digital photographers with a limited budget.  If I could choose all over again, I'd probably have probably gone with the Spyder2PRO package.", "label": 2}

{"text": "How well the .mac account will work for you and whether it'll be worth the money really depends on how you work with your computer and how you want to work with it.  You can definitely find other services out there that fill one or more of the same functions that you would get from .mac and you may also be able to add up all of the services you want and come up with a price tag lower than that of a .mac account.\n\nWhat you really need to think about when you're deciding to buy this is how much the difference in cost means to you compared to the amount of effort that it will save you.  In a service like this, I'll often see other computer users talk about how you can do the job with something much cheaper.  What they sometimes forget is that some people just don't want to spend time (or don't HAVE time for) learning a number of different kinds of software and how to go about using them.\n\nIf you're in that group, having all of the services included in .mac as a set is a big help.  It means that you'll have fewer different sets of settings to maintain, and the user interfaces will work in roughly the same way for all of them so that you can spend less time trying to figure it out.  Also, some other software might require that you spend more time on things like figuring out what server names to tell it, what port numbers to use, and that kind of thing.  With the .mac set, however, the software knows immediately that it will be contacting the .mac servers, so already handled for you.\n\nIf you're a power user, you'll probably find it easy to find other services to do what you want to do and you'll probably find figuring them out to be easy enough that this isn't worth the cost to you.  If you use your computer more casually, and you just want to do what you want to do and then get back to the rest of your life there's a good chance this is worth it.\n\nOne warning that I should add, if you're considering buying this so that you can get the use of the excellent Backup program that comes in the set, it may actually not be worth it.  The next version of OS X (10.5 aka Leopard) includes a feature known as Time Machine that adds similar function without the yearly subscription cost.  Of course, the .mac Backup can put your files on their servers, which protects you from a total hard drive failure in a way that Time Machine (or any other backup system that keeps the files on the same hard drive) can't.  On the other hand, you ought to be able to replicate that fairly easily by making sure that you copy anything vital to a CD, DVD, or external hard drive on a regular basis.\n\nAt any rate, the Time Machine feature is not available yet, but will be on the new version of OS X due to be released in the Spring of 2007.  If you intend to upgrade to it immediately, that means just a couple of months before software is built into the operating system to do backups for you.  Since you can only buy .mac subscriptions in 1 year chunks, if backups is your goal you may want to just save yourself a bit of money and wait out the couple of months.  I'd strongly suggest looking around on the Internet for descriptions of Time Machine so that you can decide whether it will suit your needs better (or as well as) .mac Backup.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I just finished my will and other estate and personal documents:  Will, declaration of trust, advanced directives, durable power of attorney (finances), general durable power of attorney (attorney-in-fact), and medical durable power of attorney.  I used WillMaker and found it to be as advertised.  However, by the time I had prepared all documents, enough questions had arisen that I decided to contact a local attorney for help with answers.  In numerous places of the WillMaker instructions, the user is informed that contacting an attorney might be necessary and is a good idea if needed.  I learned a number of very important estate-protecting things from the attorney that I could not have learned in WillMaker (tips from an insider, one might say).  I also learned that several of the state-specific forms provided by WillMaker were quite far from ideal - not incorrect, just prepared and formatted in ways that could cause problems and delays for my estate executor and beneficiaries.  After my second meeting with the attorney, I had the opinion that I could have saved myself one hell of a lot of work had I gone to him in the first place.  I paid the attorney for his good services - including all that horrible witness signing and notarization business for which I have no stomach.  The cost for for having him do it all would have been under $300.  To me, given all the time I spent doing the initial work on WillMaker, the necessary change work I did on WillMaker after consulting the attorney, and all the yuck I would have gone through on my own getting notarization & witnessing of documents, the better alternative would have been to have the attorney do it all in the first place.  By the way, I found that once I committed to the WillMaker approach, making document changes recommended by the attorney was not such a simple thing (formatting issues using the WillMaker's ready-made templates).  So I think that WillMaker is a good product, but before you decide to go the WillMaker route, ask yourself if it is likely that you will want or need to consult with an attorney anyway (if only to ensure that everything is exactly right - not just legally right - for your executor and beneficiaries) and if you have the paper-management skills and patience to complete the project on your own.

{"text": "First of all, I would like to point out that the editorial review above is not for Secrets Can Kill.  It is for one of the other games in the series, and is therefore a better review than Secrets Can Kill deserves.  It may be confusing to see the editorial review for the Tower mystery right under the title for Secrets Can Kill.\nI love the Nancy Drew series, and I am a college-educated woman in my thirties.  I have played four out of the first five games in the series (I have not played Stay Tuned for Danger).  The other games have wonderful graphics and storylines.  Talking to the other characters is enjoyable, and the puzzles are challenging enough for an adult when played on the senior detective level.  I played Secrets Can Kill on the Master level (there are three levels for this game instead of two), and I found that my nine-year-old son was not challenged by the puzzles.  Most of the puzzles are easily solved word puzzles that have clues as to the items to gather or hints about the character's secrets.  However, most of the puzzles have nothing to do with the game play itself.  There is one slide puzzle that allows you to find an inventory item; otherwise, the puzzles are just there for hints.  As mentioned in other reviews, this game has cartoon-like characters rather than the 3D-type characters in the other games, and it really does make the game less interesting.  The dialogue is uninteresting and the characters become hostile and barely speak to Nancy through most of the game.  Overall, the game requires only a few answered puzzles to solve the mystery, and the ending is disappointing, to say the least.  I gave this two stars instead of one, which was my first inclination, because I feel that it might be interesting for a child to play, especially if the child has not had very much experience with adventure games for the computer; however, a child would probably still at least want to play on the senior detective level.

The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First, before you buy this product, you should understand that it is NOT intended to replace good, high-detail paper topo maps.  Relying simply on a sensitive piece of electronic equipment without a good map and compass in the backcountry is not a well-advised decision.  (\"Whoops!  Shouldn't have dropped my GPS on those rocks.\"  \"Darn!  Coulda sworn I packed extra batteries!\"  You get the picture.)\n\nThat said, I've found it to be an excellent supplement to 1:24,000 paper maps.  The detail is surprisingly good; I recently completed a section of the Continental Divide Trail in Colorado and found most (but not all) of the trail information from the 7.5' maps on the GPS map.  It's nice to be able to instantly correlate your position between the GPS and a paper map, and the contour lines simply make it easier to visualize your position.  It also shows points of interest like small lakes and rivers, and even old mines and such.  The contour lines do not always perfectly jive up with higher-detail maps, but are close enough.  There does seem to be a problem with not enough contour lines at higher magnifications, so you won't want to zoom in too close if you want to see the lay of the land on your unit.  Position accuracy, however, was very good and appeared just about spot-on with my paper maps.\n\nInstallation is easy and the data meshes seamlessly with other MapSource products (well, City Select, anyway, which is the other MapSource product I currently own).  My Garmin GPS60CS holds a tremendous amount of topographical information in its 64 MB internal memory; I fit in almost the entire west half of Colorado plus City Select info for numerous cities between Colorado and Michigan.\n\nOne big downside to having so much information loaded is that map-drawing times are achingly slow on my unit, especially if detail is set on Most and Declutter is set to Off.  I found that by unselecting topo information for areas I didn't need, drawing times were improved substantially, though still a bit irritating.  Scrolling to a new area and waiting for the map to catch up can be tedious.  I usually leave Declutter on unless I need a particular detail in an area.\n\nI did not have the opportunity (or the need) to map routes using this software.  I have done so with City Select and found it simple and effective, but don't know how this will translate into Topo.  I've heard and read that the National Geographic maps are better for route mapping, but your results may vary.  I suspect that this is due in large part to the fact that NatGeo maps are 1:24,000 in detail, much higher than USA Topo, so errors will naturally be smaller.  Thus far I have not needed to map routes, as I rely on my map and compass more than my electronics for detailed positioning (and my pencil never runs out of batteries), with my GPS as a verification device.  I can see where this would be an issue, however, if you do a lot of off-trail exploring or otherwise have the need for a detailed, precise route through tricky country.\n\nValue-wise I'd say USA Topo qualifies as very good, particularly in light of the fact that Garmin tends to nickel-and-dime you to death with all of their maps and accessories.  However, you can get USA Topo online for 75 or 80 bucks, and that includes topo information for all 50 states.\n\nMy conclusion is that as an advanced, standalone navigation tool for backcountry climing, canyoneering, and other off-trail stuff, USA Topo is a poor choice.  It's fine for trail-hikers and those that don't go bushwhacking, but still no replacement for a good 1:24,000 paper map.  However, if you use it as a supplemental tool and recognize its limitations, it's just dandy.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I bought this because of the price and the reviews.  I had taken part of a semester of Japanese at the city college and boy was I disappointed.  I have a good deal of language learning experience and I just felt like the teacher I had was making it way too complicated (although I think she was trying to make it easier in her defense).  It really isn't all that difficult of complex a language.  It's simply mysterious because of the writing system and grammar differences.\n\nHere's my advice.  Take the hiragana and write down the first ten characters.  Repeat repeat repeat until you can do it from memory.  Then add ten more.  Repeat procedure.  You will have all of your hiragana and katakana down in no time.  Honestly, a couple of days would suffice if you really want to learn it quickly.  Once you have that down, you will feel like you have your feet on the ground and the rest will not be so scary.  If you would like to practice, you can google \"hiragana practice\" or something like that and find quite a few little quizzes or games, etc.  That's a good way to keep it current.\n\nAnyway, Human Japanese is exactly that, human.  It's not going to treat you like a robot student and try to program you with information.  Expect to be told digestable amounts of information.  It will obviously be quite different than English, so just accept it and move on.  Things will start to come together before long and you will find there are some things you actually understand.  This is encouraging.  Now and then, bits and pieces of cultural knowledge will come up to break up the lessons and keep it from getting boring.  This is all done in a very friendly way, as if you were learning from a gentle tutor who just wants you to enjoy learning and eventually understand.  Honestly, this is how it should be.\n\nAlso, customer support is very friendly.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Further problems with Microsoft 365 Word. Do not try to write macros. Macros in earlier versions of Word work fine. For some reason macros for earlier versions do not work, and if you write a macro that has anything to do with Find/Replace, it will not behave in a similar fashion to earlier versions. This is partly because the people who designed 365 assume users of no particular skill, who are content to use Word just the way it comes out of the box. In other words, Word 365 is more automated, less kindly about those who want to tailor it to do specialized functions. I'm sure that people who are conversant in Visual Basic will have better luck. I am not, and will go back to an earlier version of Word (Everything up to 2010 worked perfectly.)\n\nAgain (check below for more), there is little I can discover in Word 365 that warrants a subscription. That you are renting it year by year, from my point of view, is just another Microsoft scam.\n\nI would strongly recommend anyone who has used earlier versions of Office (probably up to 2007 for PC) to stick with the older versions. Although I am still in the free trial period, I find Office 365 Word the most bloated, difficult to use, counterintuitive program of any writing program I have ever used. I think what the designers had in mind was the ultimate \"automated\" program possible--imagine a car with swerve control, automatic parallel parking, object detection, automatic braking. That is what 365 Word is. The ribbon by itself hoards the screen. Though retractable, you will not easily be very productive as you will be spending most of your time searching for the functions that, as far as I know were available in the classic menu in the version previous to 2010. The program is so fully automated that it is human proof. There might be workarounds, but I have as of yet been able to work with its newly designed \"styles\" which they splash across the screen as if, writing were nothing more than prettifying your page. My sense is that the programmers are \"peachy proud\" of all the new features they have built into this mayhem.  You can, of course, after you pay Microsoft for your annual prescription, buy downloadable \"classic menu\" software--that too will cost you, and then, you can buy book, reference books that you can read late into the night.  My question would be why would anyone put money out for a program that is as difficult as learning a new language. And why would a user of  Word all the way back to the '97 version have to dedicated so very much time to relearning what is meant to perform the simple function of writing.\nPerhaps you have the time. I'm going back to the 2003 version.\n\nI have since added the classical menu, courtesy of [...] I am still in the 15 day free trial period, but the classical drop-down menu does improve the ease of use of Word 365. The Classical Menu software even has a couple of functions that are not listed in the ribbon menu. I have updated my rating for 365 to two stars. Still a difficult program for us long time users who used to enjoy the transparency of the older versions.\n\nAug 1. Update. Again, I would warn the user of earlier versions to expect the unexpected. Since I last updated this review, two strange factors  have occurred. First, Word 365 stripped out macros I wrote in my desktop (I followed instructions, went to options/trust/and enabled all macros). It worked on my laptop but not my desktop. Second, for reasons unknown to me, suddenly Word 365 started saving my docx in 365 format and not 93-97. More strange, if you go to your folders from 365, it won't show anything but your 365 formats. This is not true if you go to your microsoft windows view.\nAlso, I wish to note, that Word, if like me, you have Windows 7 and only 8 gig ram, 365 programs are as slow as molasses in Vermont in the dead of winter.\nAdding to its slowness is a splash page inbetween what used to be the relatively simple operation of saving your file. First you have to go to a file screen, then to save or save as or browse, or, etc. The file splash screen is  more aesthetic than functional and again shows the programmers of 365 to be more interested in \"pretty\" over \"efficient.\"\nI do not think overpriced 365 will last. Libra Office, which I had thought lacked a decent outline format (like Word) now has one, and even an add-on program, Organum.\n\nI am  probably trying the patience of anyone who wants to take in a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. Another defect I discovered in Office Word 365 is that there is no option to create a backup copy of your documents with a \"save.\" You can use Options, Advanced to save a backup copy, but it saves your file in the \"Roaming\" folder (if your hard drive goes, your backup goes). Of course, you can use the Cloud, but that too is a separate operation. As with the Classic Menus, you have to buy a special software program if you want to streamline your save procedure.\nThis is the deal Microsoft made with the devil. Pay us the subscription cost for our bloated program. If you want our program to work for you, well, you''ll have to buy add-on programs.", "label": 0}

Out of the four games I've played (\"Final Scene,\" \"Secrets Can Kill,\" \"Message in a Haunted Mansion, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\"), \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.\nNancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.\nThe locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL.

TaxCut is really vague about tuition assistance programs and when and when not to claim the tax credit.\nIf you get into not so common areas, such as married couples that worked and lived in separate states for part of the year, forget it!\nFor fun, I tried to give myself some of the uncommon tax credits, and the software was almost no help.  I pretended to be eligible for some alternative energy tax credit and the software told me to fill in the form myself, no questions, no hints, and no easy access to the IRS publication (I had to open another screen and go back and forth)\nIf your taxes are straightforward for the most part, feel free to use the software, but if you are experiencing unique circumstances for the year, go to a professional.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I purchased the Sony DCR-DVD 300 video cam and thought this software would dovetail with the camera. but not so since it doesn't even recognize the camera - the camera is that new. I have to use the included software, Imagemaker, which is very flawed and  has already caused me to reinstall my Windows XP and do the hours of updates. From Imagemaker you need to convert the video file to an MPEG 2 before Screenblaster will recognize it.\nSo now were into the software and it certainly does have some nice features. The learning curve is somewhat steep and I tend to do things without reading the instructions first and this software is not necessarily ergonomically easy to use at first. But time and experience and reading the instruction book helps.\nMy main gripe is that when doing cross fades I suddenly have annoying clicks in the vicinity of where the fades are. I can eliminate them either by completely rebuilding the \"event\" or isolating each loud click and deleting it but then I also delete a very small fragment of the video.\nI've written Sony and they don't seem to know what's going on. I've followed all of their suggestions but to no avail. And at this stage they don't have any updates for it.\nWhat's clear to me is that Sony has produced a fine camera but the software comes from companies they just purchased and it's somewhat behind in technology. So buyers beware - good features but glitchy. I suspect that with time future software updates will make this a good program.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Unfortunately I agree this is the worst version of Virusscan ever released and would strongly recommend against buying unless McAfee gets the serious bugs out. First of all it does not work very well with Win2000, especially if you have the latest version (SP2). If you have a dual boot (Win98/Win2000 installation) forget it!!! -- it will not install correctly! Installation is very rocky with very little in the way of diagnostic messages if there is a problem.\nHowever, the absolute killer is the total lack of technical  support, which is very dangerous if you have a problem. The retail box appears to suggest there is technical support, but that is a total illusion. There is absolutely no free telephone support, even for installation issues. They want to charge $2.99/minute (!) with no free minutes, even if there is a program bug. If you try to call them, through customer service; (a toll call) they are quite unpleasant and unhelpful.\nThere is very limited website support, but they do not respond to emails and the website has almost no material on 6.0. The chat line appears to go to some foreign country and except for very basic material is useless as well.\nThis is a very disappointing program, almost a beta. It is totally inadequate for beginners, who if they have a problem, are completely on their own, but even experienced users are going to be upset if they have a problem, considering the very poor documentation provided with the product, with almost no troubleshooting or error message material.\nUntil an improved bug free version is provided, new buyers should pass this product by. It is worse than most shareware or freeware products and a sad shadow of the much better McAfee products of earlier years.", "label": 0}

Qualified, accredited higher education institutions include Universities, Polytechnic schools, and Institutes of Technology, as well as other post-secondary level institutions, such as colleges and vocational schools that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Restrictions may vary by country.\nIndividual must successfully verify their eligibility status through the Offer Site's online academic verification process; and\nIndividual must have a Microsoft account or create one at the time of purchase.\nIf you participate in the Program, Microsoft reserves the right to contact you directly or through an appointed Microsoft vendor to verify that you are an Eligible Student. If you choose not to provide sufficient documentation to Microsoft or its appointed vendor that verifies that you are an Eligible Student, you agree to reimburse Microsoft for the difference between what you paid in connection with a discounted Program offer and the estimated full retail price of the same product(s). Microsoft will have sole discretion to determine the sufficiency of any documentation that you provide to verify you are an Eligible Student. By providing eligibility-related information to Microsoft's appointed vendor, you agree that the vendor may share such information with Microsoft for Program-related purposes.\n\nMicrosoft, in its sole discretion, may accept other forms of validation to determine eligibility in lieu of the online academic verification process. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, may determine the criteria for eligibility under the Program and may change the eligibility criteria or deny eligibility at any time and for any reason.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Despite seeing the other reviews claiming the game won't work on Win 7, I decided to give the seller the benefit of the doubt and give it a try since the item info claimed it was compatible with Windows 7. So now I am adding my voice to the others. IT DOES NOT WORK! Windows 7 is a 32 or 64 bit Operating System and it just will NOT run a 16 bit program like this, even in compatibility mode. I'm fairly tech savvy (at least compared to most people) so I thought I could get it to work where others couldn't. I tried everything, I've been coaxing and cajoling my computer for hours to get this thing to work, to no avail. I tried every tip I could find online for ways to get it to work and just ran into the same problem every time: it's a 16 bit game, a 32/64 bit OS just won't do it. I even installed a Virtual Machine app which creates a simulation of an older computer, only to discover that it would still need me to install the old Windows 95 OS in order to do anything. The disk for that OS runs about $30 here on amazon. So to play a $5 game I bought for my kindergartner, I'd need to either buy another $30 piece of software, or just buy a whole new (older) computer. What a waste of time. I am totally disappointed. I was so excited about this game as it is the one I learned to read from as a child and was really looking forward to sharing it with her, and she was super psyched about it too being such a video game enthusiast herself.

This will do little for your ability to speak, because your going to have to translate the English to Spanish in your head, and vis versa. How can you say anything If you don't know for sure what the words and phrases mean. This is the way children learn right.  (...). Want to say I want this or I need that, your out of luck, because this program does not show, or explain how. Everything in this course is third person.

A small problem considering you will use these verb conjucations at least 70-80% of the time in the present tense. If you get this course you need a dictionary, a verb conj. book, and if you can afford it the pimseur series, or Barron's FSI (IF you don't have the money).

This thing is loaded.\nNow I know that most of you reading this haven't gotten past my initial remark that, \"for a long time I WAS and enormous fan...\" If you're wondering how a program that seems to be so user friendly, so loaded with options, so stable and so well designed could lose the admiration of a long time fan, I'll tell you.\nA few months back I purchased a new TDK CD burner. The burner came with Nero 5.0 burning software. I had heard of Nero but was completely unfamiliar with it. I installed it and hated it. It was not half as user-friendly as Easy CD Creator and that part frustrated me. I read that Nero was also loaded with cool features but the problem was, I couldn't figure out how to work them. The help screens in the program were lame and it came with no manual. Frustrated I returned to my Easy CD Creator program and installed it again. Something terrible then happened; neither programs would work right. Things started to crash. I browsed the Net to find answers and discovered that Nero and Adaptec absolutely cannot co-exist on the same machine. This fueled my hatred for Nero even more. Eventually I had to completely re-format my hard drive and start over. This time I installed Adaptec exclusively. But then I discovered something else. My new burner was NOT supported by Adaptec and so nothing worked quite right. I re-formatted again and installed Nero. I was hacked (in the \"mad\" sort of way, not that I was actually hacked, physically or electronically - ok, just a brief point of clarification there for our viewers)! But if I was ever going to be able to burn CD's with my new burner I knew that I would have to learn Nero.\nTo make a long story short, I discovered the joy of Nero! It is a fantastic program and, in my opinion, it's much better than Adaptec software any day! The only gripe I have is that it is not as user friendly, however the options and features are fantastic! You just have to commit some time (and a few frisbees) to figure out what the heck you're doing.\nBut there's more to the reason why I so dislike Adaptec now. Over time I have discovered that a lot of the CD's created with Adaptec do not operate well on all other computers or audio devices. In fact, some CD's I'd made with Adaptec caused Windows to crash when I tried to access them on other computers. Since I started with Nero, and put the effort into learning how to use it properly, it is so much better! I have yet to see a machine that rejected a disk I made with Nero, but Adaptec flopped often. I think the reason why I didn't notice the problems with Adaptec for so long is because I was predominantly playing and accessing disks made with Easy CD Creator on machines that also had Adaptec.\nAdaptec software has a lot of fantastic features and they are easy to use and the program comes with a great manual! I will say that the VCD maker works nicely and burning a regular audio CD works well. If this is predominately your usage intentions then you will be happy with the program. However, when it comes to making things like MP3 CD's or even just data CD's you may be in for some headaches. Not necessarily if your burning them and using them on the same system, but if you try to use the disk on another computer without Adaptec software, or sometimes even with it, you might discover what I'm talking about.\nAnyway, all of that to say that there are positives and negatives about this program. Perhaps your experience will be different. I just know that I really dig Nero now! Granted, it was a bit of a headache to learn how to use (and some features I am still learning how to use), but it is very stable and makes perfect copies of anything. You will just have to determine what's more important to you; ease of use or actually being able to use what you created. For me the latter won the coin toss! Good luck!", "label": 2}

(I guess the GPS support is improved. But, I don't have a GPS.)\n\nPC Integration\n--------------\nThe integration with Outlook is slightly improved, but is still very disappointing.\n\nThe primitive integration with Outlook is still lacking. I expect outlook would allow me to jump to S&T from a Contract.\n\nNo, the taskbar icon \"Display Map of Address\" in the Contract window open to a webpage, instead of jumping to S&T. And, needless to say, it doesn't work when you're not connected to the Internet. Not to mention piracy concerns, a major reason to to buy a desktop map software.\n\nA terrible bug was fixed: at least, I can now copy multiple lines address and paste it to \"Find a Location\" box in the newer version. (In 2002, I had to copy address line-by-line, and add spaces and/or commas between lines.)\n\nDrag-n-drop of address text still doesn't work.\n\nThe so call \"integration with Outlook\" was a shame. It only let you import all addresses you already have. The only thing the importing does is pin-point the addresses on your map. (need to re-import when you got new addresses). This feature is barely useable. I can't figure why I want 200+ pins on my map! Why this integration is more important...\n\nPocketPC integration\n--------------------\nZooming map is slightly faster, especially with large *.mps file. Added GPS support (but, again, I don't have the GPS)\n\nThe integration finally work now on my Tohshiba e330. I can select an contact item, \"right-click\", choose \"find on Map\", and it pin-point and jump to the location. However, the right *.mps file must have been opened.\n\nAnother critical usablity bug is also fixed. I can now copy-n-paste an address into the \"Find Address\" box. (Can you believe it that the 2002 version didn't even support copy-n-paste? Needed to remeber the whole address and type every single letters, everytime!)\n\nCopy-n-paste of multiple lines of address still doesn't work. (like older S&T). Well, with the proper *.mps opened, you might got one from the list with the first line if you're lucky.\n\nOverall, a good map software with poor integration!!", "label": 2}

When I upgraded to Windows XP, I bought this new version of Norton SystemWorks to go with it without any hesitation.  Unfortunately, I was dissapointed by a number of things.\nFirst off, let me tell you what I liked.  Norton AntiVirus is still the best of the breed virus protection you can buy.  It automatically configures itself to protect you not only from viruses hidden in files and downloads, but it will also scan both your incoming and outgoing e-mail.  By scanning the outgoing e-mail, it prevents you from spreading viruses like Melissa without even knowing it.  Nice touch.\nLive Update is also a top notch feature.  Live Update will check for updates such as virus definitions and program updates in the background and automatically apply them.  No user input needed.  Symantec could not have made it simpler.\nUnfortunately, there aren't a lot of new features in Norton SystemWorks 2002.  In fact, if you use Norton SystemWorks 2002 on a Windows NT/2000 or Windows XP machine, you will find several features missing.  Two features I really miss are the Optimization Wizard in Norton Utilities and the Registry Sweep in Norton CleanSweep.  Symantec does not tell you that these features do not work on Windows NT/2000/XP until after you have purchased the product.\nPerhaps sensing that there was not a lot of new features to justify an upgrade, Symatec has included Roxio's GoBack which can help you revert your system to an earlier state should you run into a problem.  This feature is totally uncessary for users of Windows Me or Windows XP since Microsoft includes the System Restore feature that accomplishes the same thing.  In fact, many of the features in Norton SystemWorks 2002 are already included in newer versions of Windows (such as disk defragmenters and uninstallers).\nGiven this, there may not be a lot of reason to buy Norton SystemWorks 2002.  Most people really only need the Norton AntiVirus component which can be purchased cheaper as a standalone.\nOverall, Norton SystemWorks 2002 is still a quality product, but there is just not a lot of reasons to justify an upgrade.", "label": 2}

I tried to format, re-format, erase, and then re-format with no success.\n4) The InCD program said all my new CD-RWs had logic errors on them.  But 5 from 2 different makers?\n5) With the Nero Burning program, I experienced buffer underruns, Joliet naming problems, and more.

The general concensus was that the product was okay without being exceptional but that Symantec has turned into an greedy, arrogant ogre that only wants your money.

It couldn't remove a virus that it had let through and recommended manual removal.  I followed the instructions on Symantec's web site but they didn't work.  The virus kept reinfecting my computer and it took me days to figure out how to remove it properly (which I had to do by visiting McAfee's site and other rival sites).  I wanted to flag this up to Symantec but (unbelievably!) they now offer no online support whatsoever!  Just on an offchance, I tried sending an email to support@symantec.com.  It got bounced back!!

{"text": "This was a game that had a huge amount of potential and failed miserably.  In most of these squad-based games there is at least a little bit of roleplaying.  In this game there is none--character development is non-existent, and given the mission requirements, your picks among the pre-generated characters are often extremely limited.\nThe gameplay is, likewise, monotonous.  It seems fun for the first few missions but then you realize that it's the same thing over and over again.  After about the tenth mission I was bored out of my skull, and my willpower failed near the 13th mission and I just stopped playing.\nShortly after I gave up in disgust I picked up Fallout Tactics.  If you are considering getting a game in the squad-based tactics genre get that one.  You get exceptional control over character development (in fact, the characters actually develop as the game goes along, unlike those in Away Team!), throughout the entire game you get access to new weapons and technology (which means that your tactics have to change as you progress) and the missions themselves are a lot more fun!\nTo sum up.

{"text": "Of the scrapbook applications I've played with, this one is a favorite. It has straight-forward features and it produces handsome scrapbook pages and other simple projects with a generous variety of clipart, borders, and fonts. Frustrations include 1) the inability to crop the clip-art (only photographs can be cropped) and 2) the inability to do anything interesting with color-changing and clipart. i.e. If you change the color of a piece of clipart, it doesn't \"colorize\" (turn into shades of the color you picked). Instead, it does an opaque fill of the clipart, leaving just a blank silhouette. At this point, the 'Undo' features are very handy! In any event, provided you have another application to do anything subtle with your clip-art or your photographs, this application is fantastic for fun, simple pasteboard projects where you create layouts and print or save.

Apple no longer cares about OS 9. Rename the font by putting a space and the number 18 after the name New York. Double click the font to install. Restart. DONE. Hope this helps.

I purchased the book that's all over the net \"Dan Ablan's Lightwave 7 book\" the book has like a billion intimidating pages to read and he ASSUMES you already know the basics of 3D modeling.

{"text": "I've just completed reading the reviews on various home design software deciding which one to purchase. While they all seem to leave something to be desired (not to mention their confusing names and software lineage), you can make a variety of roof types with this software. I have the demo for \"3D Home Architect\" Home Design Deluxe 6 by Broderbund as it says in the About dialog. Although amazon says this is from The Learning Company, apparently the software is made by Riverdeep and distributed by Broderbund. If you google on that you will find the press release.\n\nToday I made a standard gable roof using the default 20 or 45 degrees, a standard hip roof, a low angle ranch style gable roof of 15 degrees, a \"shed\" style gable roof with a pitch of 15 degrees on one slope and 20 degrees on the other, and to test the extremes, another one of 15 and 5 degrees. I tried to make a flat roof, but either I missed something or you need to make a gable roof of zero degrees, but it would not accept anything below 5 degrees.\n\nThe slope can be specified in 1 in N style, N in 12 or percent instead of degrees.\n\nThe roof tools are a bit counter-intuitive and obscure. It took me a while to figure out how to use them. Although the Wizard is limited to a choice of 20 or 45 degree pitches, if you look at the roof properties, you can specify ANY ANGLE (within limits) once a roof is constructed. Also, in the roof list there are only 20 and 45 degree pitches listed standard for Hip roofs. But you can change these to any angle (mind the 5* minimum).\n\nOne of the difficult things to notice and get your head around is that these tiny blue squares on the roof selection marquee are how you affect changes to just one section of the automatically generated roof. So to create a gable roof, you need to first create a Hip roof, then select the roof, select the blue square for the end you want a gable, then click Properties, then change the roof type for that section to gable. I know, it is weird, having to change the roof type for just a section when \"gable\" usually refers to the whole roof.\n\nIf you don't select the blue square you will change the whole roof and just get frustrated.\n\nMaking a curved roof is also strange. It creates one with Hip style ends. You must select and convert the ends to Gable, oddly enough to create an arched roof with \"gable\" ends where the siding is exposed beneath the curve. You have to get used to working with each end of a roof individually. The end result is unfortunately a kind of \"barn\" style roof that is not really curved. By increasing the radius on sections, I was able to get a smoother curve without flat spots. If you think about it, the radius of a curved roof is wider at the base than the building, so the default radius is not enough. By fiddling with the roof data I was able to make a downward curved oriental gable roof. I still was not able to make a satisfactory curved roof or for it to display truss framing for it. I may try adjusting a double slope.\n\nIt always crashes when I try to TrueView render the scene, from the diagnostics it apparently is my ATI drivers or more probably the OpenGL drivers. Crashes have been rare otherwise.\n\nI gave this three stars because I am reviewing a trail version and my knowledge is incomplete. I was able in a few days to create a complete custom house design. The interface is reasonbly usable and it mostly worked. There are many limitations and questions I have left to answer.\n\nOne drawback is the landscape. It is separate from the home designer, so your second floor just floats in the air and you need it to create a sloping ground level. I could not set my home in a split level landscape and also split level or bilevel homes on a single level foundation are tricky to make.", "label": 2}
{"text": "There are some things I like about this total package but when it is all added up it is a confusing mess that if used by itself could have you spending a lot of time memorizing specific phrases and hoping that the native speaker you're conversing with know the specific response that you've memorized already to understand. I've wrote an essay which probably noone will read so for those who just need some concise points:\n\nWhat I like:\n-The Level 3, Disc 1 (more below)\n-The included Audio CD\n-The price at $20 is reasonable\n\nWhat I don't like:\n-The lack of coheshion between the different CDs\n-The absurd claims on the box\n-The absence of grammar/sentence structures/verb conjugations in the computer program\n-The use of 9 CDs/DVDs to market the program when it could all be contained on 2, possibly one disc.\n\nThis is what you can expect to find on the different discs included, inclding their pluses and negatives.\n\nLevel 1, Disc 1\nThis disc will teach you the basics of Spanish vocabulary, you'll learn some basic colors, numbers, body parts, food.  It is the 2nd strongest CD in the set, don't expect to be wowed by the graphics, games, or highly research-validated advanced language immersive techniques.  It's at a technological level of probably around 20 years ago and honestly was probably developed 20 years ago but has received a few \"real-life\" actors to make it seem polished, but after watching (and laughing) at the same over-exagerrated \"Si\" for correct answers I switched to the low-tech computer cartoon characters.  The easy games are painfully easy, and the other games help you learn the vocabulary but all are basically the same game with different vocabulary words, so you'll get bored if trying to cram too much in at one time.\n\nLevel 1, Disc 2\nYou'd expect this to be a continuation of what you learned in the first disc but you'd be wrong.  I think the person who decided what to put in the box saw this old language program laying around from 25 years ago and figured might as well throw another CD in.  It has some more vocabulary which you can record yourself saying and 3 games (really just one game style formatted a bit differently) that you can pick out the picture to the vocabulary word, one of the main reason I bought the set was to learn more vocabulary but there really isn't much interaction with the program to learn the words besides looking at the pictures and then memorizing the word.  And I'm not really sure who picked out the vocab words, I've never heard a Spanish person speaking about Igloos, so why would I want to learn it as a beginner?  And is professions we're given an orchesta director but not a firefighter or police officer.\n\nLevel 2, Disc 1\nThis disc will teach you some common phrases and the alphabet, phrases you'll use at the airport, restaurants, around town.  As a beginner you'll want to learn some of these phrases and you'll be picking up vocabulary as well.  Unfortunately this might be the most boring way to learn.  You can listen to the phrase in English or your language of choice and then hear it in Spanish, but it is much more exciting to repeat the phrase into a microphone as well and then you can hear yourself say it, I suppose perfecting your pronounciation by doing it over and over again, provided you can objectively hear what you may not be pronouncing right.  There are exciting multiple-choice quizes for most of the categories, but the 10 multiple choices questions are always the same (random order) so a category might have 20 phrases but you'll only be quized the same 10 questions over and over again.  What scares me the most about this CD (and also Level 2, Disc 2 & Level 3, Disc 2 - which are structured identially only different phrases/categories) is that you can memorize 200 phrases but will only be picking up grammar, sentence structure, and other Spanish syntax by chance.  For example, you'll learn how to ask \"How are you?\", \"Como estas?\" in Espanol but the background picture is of two men greeting in a very formal setting which would typically mean that \"Como esta?\" the more formal way of saying \"How are you?\" is appropriate, but no where on the CDs are you going to learn about Tu vs. Usted, sure you'll be understood but it's such a basic topic in Spanish (and without a direct equilivant in English) that I can't believe \"The COMPLETE Language Learning System\" doesn't have it clearly explained in some form.  The other concern is you'll be learning phrases that use verbs in the form of the present tense, subjunctive, conditional, future, imperfect, and perfect indicative, but again no where on the CDs does it cover verb tenses, or even verb conjugations.  So you might learn to say I want to go to the park, Quiero ir al parque, but after completing all the CD and memorize 600 phrases, not know how to say We want to go to the park, Queremos...PLEASE don't think that this program alone will get you to any level beyond beginning Spanish skills.\n\nLevel 2, Disc 2\nThis follows the exact same format as Disc 1, 200 more phrases and vocabulary, covering school, families, hobbies, computers, sports.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.\n\nLevel 3, Disc 1\nThis is the CD I like, and honestly if they sold this alone for $10 and didn't claim you could reach all your language dreams and hopes, I'd give this 5 stars.  Again, this is a piece of software in this set like Level 1, Disc 2 that just seems to be thrown in, it is probably a good 20 years old as well but what I like about this is it is more immersive, you'll want some vocab lists to play the games but you're not going to find any, you'll click the help button and it'll give you more help in Spanish and you're like a lot good that'll do me but it does for example it might tell you a sentence in Spanish to pick the black dog, presuming you don't know the word for black or dog you click the help button and it show you a picture of a car that is black and says, here is a black car, you brain hears negro twice finds the only similarities between the black car and the other pictures to choose from is that one is black, negro=black, you click, you're right, happiness and your brain makes the connection, with repetition the connection come quicker, that is some good brain learning theory on this program. One of the games gives you directions in Spanish and then you have to find it on a map and again unlike the same multiple choice questions on the other CDs that get boring after the first time it is different each time so you can actually practice listening to directions in Spanish and figuring out where you need to go (a very valuable skill if you ever plan on using that \"Donde esta el/la...\" phrase).  There's also a little gameshow simulation that you can play against the computer or against a worthy opponent, again the multiple choice questions have enough variations that it doesn't get bored in like 10 seconds.  After finishing up the a few other things on the other discs this will be the only one that I'll come back to use.\n\nLevel 3, Disc 2\nI which this were more like the first disc at this level but it regresses to the Level 2 format.  Yes we can record 200 more phrases and vocabulary, now covering business meetings, finance, and accounting!!  Woohoo!  If you buy it right off the website by itself it costs nearly $50!  So how lucky we are that we can now talk business.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.\n\nThen there are the other 3 other discs:\nTalk More Ineractive DVD\nThis is Level 2, Disc 1 in a DVD format.  Instead of using your mouse you can use your remote control, but I guess you can't record yourself speaking, but you can play the exact same multiple choice quizes now with a time limit, if you could play all the lessons at once it would be great as a sleep-aide.\n\nWho is Oscar Lake? Game\nAdmitedly, this is what intrigued me enough about this software program compared to the others.  Very few are going to finish this game because it won't appeal to the gamer or serious Spanish learner.  The gamer will get frustrated with it archaic design, the point to click to move to this area or enter this room is not engaging and probably just frustate those who don't play video games because it isn't very intuitive.  The serious Spanish learner will get bored with fixed conversations and the amount of clicking in between the conversations.  I played for about 2 hours and found the most entertaining part where I could turn on the TV and see a picture of a piece of luggage and hear a recorded ad to buy that luggage.  It'll be a bored day for me when I figure out who is Oscar Lake.\n\nThe Audio CD\nIf you remember the beginning you'll recall this is something that I like.  The audio CD has no direct tie-in with anything else, another stand-alone product that got lumped into the complete set.  The audio CD is the only place you'll find grammar, verbs, pronounciation, even instructions on accent marks.  This by itself would also get 4 or 5 stars, I'm guessing the workbook that they also have for sale probably parrells the audio CD.  I wish the software designed used the audio CD as their model because a lot of it could benefit an interactive visual context.  I wish it was designed so that it could just pop into the average CD player, I don't think I'm going to go thru the effort to burn it onto a special CD so I can listen to it in the car.  I doubt most people will ever get to the audio CD which is disappointing because it has the most depth if you really want to learn Spanish.\n\nConclusion:\nI read the box and it says they've sold 2.2 million units at a price of $49.95, that is over 10 million dollars!  And considering a lot of the programing they reuse with just different languages there is some serious dinero to be had in foreign language software.  Maybe all the real innovation is with Rosetta Stone they've made over 78 million dollars according to the Instant Immersion box).  I'll use what I bought for what I can get out of it, not worth the hassle of returning it, but hope someday a more complete language program comes out that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Instant Immersion/Euro Talk people if you're reading this hire some programming consultant and some language aquisition consultants before you market Instant Immersion:Level 1, 2, 3 & now 4 (super-advanced).", "label": 0}

{"text": "When I reviewed McAfee VirusScan 8.0, I only gave the program a rating of 2-stars. I've increased the rating this time around to 3-stars, but only because in hindsight I think I was too harsh on McAfee regarding what I consider to be blatant advertising, otherwise known as McAfee SecurityCenter.\n\nI'll talk more about that in a little bit, but first let's review the actual virus scanning ability.\n\nMcAfee VirusScan 9.0 is, essentially, the same program as the previous version. The only real difference is the scanning engine that operates the program, which is a behind-the-scenes item. Other than that, the only changes are cosmetic in nature.\n\nAs with the previous version, VirusScan 9.0 is relatively easy to install. I say relatively easy because before you can install the program, you need to uninstall any previous VirusScan versions as well as follow the \"pre-install\" instructions that come with it. (WARNING: I also recommend that you uninstall ALL McAfee products on your computer before trying to install any VirusScan version. VirusScan is notorious about causing conflicts if you do not perform what they call a \"clean\" install.)\n\nDespite following the above advice, I installed, updated, and adjusted the settings in less than 10 minutes. I experienced no problems with the set up, or with conducting several test scans.\n\nIn version 8.0, McAfee condensed not only the number of settings to adjust, but also the number of levels you had to navigate in order to get to all of the settings. The company also introduced their \"virus map\" feature, which allows you to, if you wish to participate, anonymously send virus information to the map system. The virus map also allows you to track viruses around the world. Wisely, McAfee left these options alone.\n\nOne area I wish McAfee had made a change to is how the program \"updates\" itself. I prefer to have the program tell me when an update is available to download (I've never really been comfortable in allowing any program to automatically download an update). Unfortunately, this requires me to physically log-in to McAfee's Website each and everytime there is an update. Thankfully, I participate in Microsoft's Passport program, so logging in only requires a click of a button. But I still think you should be able to program your McAfee username and password into Security Center. In addition, the time required to download an update is still substantially more than it was back in version 7.0. Luckily, I now have a DSL connection so the time requirement isn't that bad. But if you still have a dial-up connection, be prepared for what can be substantial update times.\n\nIn all the years I have used McAfee VirusScan, I have never once had a virus or trojan horse successfully download or install on my computer. I give the virus scanning ability of McAfee a 5-star rating.\n\nSo why the overall reduced rating? There are three reasons for it.\n\nREASON 1: For some reason, McAfee can't help themselves when it comes to screwing up either VirusScan or Security Center during updates. In each of the last four years, McAfee has issued an update that caused severe problems for its users. During version 7.0, it was the introduction of Security Center through an update that caused many computers, mine included, to lose the ability to connect to our ISPs. During version 8.0, a Security Center update created a boot-up problem that caused many computers, again mine included, to frequently be unable to start VirusScan. I'm hoping this will be the year that McAfee can avoid screwing up our computers during the udpates, but I won't hold my breath.\n\nREASON 2: McAfee's customer service is one of the worst in any industry. Their live instant messaging help is a joke. The people who run this don't listen to your problem at all. They are only trained to have you run through a series of steps. Last year my then ISP made a change in how users connected to the Internet that caused a conflict with VirusScan. My ISP knew exactly how to fix this, but I needed to get one piece of information from McAfee. Their customer service people refused to listen to me when I tried to explain to them what I needed. When I refused to follow their \"remedy\" instructions, they would disconnect from the conversation. In an effort to get an answer, I finally capitulated and followed their instructions. Big mistake. Their instructions so screwed up my computer that I had to reinstall my operating system, as well as pay money to talk to McAfee on the phone (even then, it took three weeks and 5 different people before I got my answer).\n\nREASON 3: I still do not like the blatant advertising that is called Security Center. I know this is not a big deal to many people, but it just really bugs me. The taskbar icon that is installed is not what bothers me (I actually like this feature, because I don't have to add desktop icons for each McAfee program; instead, the Security Center taskbar icon keeps everything in one, easily accessible place). What really bothers me is the Security Center splash screen (which cannot be disabled) that pops up every time you start, or restart, your computer. This splash screen is oh-so-nice in telling you whether or not you have also installed McAfee's Firewall Plus, Privacy Service, and SpamKiller. Having to see this everytime I start my computer makes me feel like I paid good money to install a pop-up advertisement.\n\nLet me condense all of the above into the following: The underlying scanning engine is about the only real change in McAfee VirusScan 9.0 (although, this version does appear to fix a couple of bugs that were introduced through the previous version's updates). The Virus Map is still neat, the update feature is still time consuming, and Security Center is still basically a McAfee adversting tool.\n\nBottom line: If the updates during version 8.0 are causing you problems, then go ahead and buy this version. Otherwise, it won't hurt to wait for version 10 before you upgrade.", "label": 2}
{"text": "You don't get anything better with this version of Windows than you do with 98.  It's slower in my opinion (my Pionex 500mhtz with 98/se works just as fast as my Dell 800mhtz with ME).  I like Dells, I haven't a thing against them, though ME isn't as great as they wanted it to be.  There's nothing really wrong with my system.  I read several other reviews and found that people probably shouldn't try to Reinstall Me, i've heard several of my IT partners saying that Me doesn't like to be reinstalled.  system restore on ME isn't reliable, i'd use something a little better.  Dell sent along Norton with my PC and it has a ZIP recovery and my HP9900 has a backup feature.  The restore points aren't really that useful in my opinion, even with other programs.\nThe one problem i will say is that the scandisk and the defrag have never completely worked like they have with other OS.  No matter how you try it, there's always something writing to the disk, changing its contents or even searching the disk that Defrag and Scandisk are constantly restarting.  If you run Scandisk you have to wait until if gives you that 10 or more error and just tell it to ignore, then walk away or go to sleep for the night, wake up and see how its doing.  The surface scan in Windows Me doesn't work at all for me, in 98/se it will but not well... but at least in 98/Se there was a way to use the DOS version of Scandisk surface scan... Only after shuttinsdown Explorer from TaskManager did i find Scandisk on standard... Dos isn't there anyways.\nThe MY PICTURES is a neat idea, but the My musix folder, the one outside the MY DOCUMENTS doesn't work... i mean it's a folder and acts like one, no problems there... but all music is defaulted to My Documents\\My Music  ...?  I don't have a problem with the Windows Media Format since i have all my own programs and really would never use a Windows program Like Media Player for really anything... WinAmp... PowerDVD... Adobe products... Quicktime... but never Realplayer... for some reason RealPlayer screws the ... out of my ME machine, so i never use it unless i like seeing the Blue screen of Death and troubleshooting some page fault or the Kernel error.\nI wouldn't suggest upgrading or really buying ME unless you just want to.  If you have plenty of money and really don't care then hey go for it... the My Pictures folder and the Thumbnail View option are pretty nifty, and the homenetworking wizard works... kinda.  One major problem is that ME is not a 98/third edition... it's more like WIN2000 for the home, watered down version and so many products are not ME compatible or ME stable.  Some will even react violently to ME and end up deleting another program or waging war with the Options and TEMP folder.  Goodluck.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Ok where to begin with Microsoft's newest P.O.S.? I had the chance to start running Microsoft Windows Me a few months ago, and I jumped at the shot. I was really happy to finally get a new OS on my machine.\n  Let me begin by letting everyone know what I am running now. I have a custom built machine, by myself. It is a Cerleron 566 overclocked to 850Mhz on an Abit Rev. II motherboard, 128mb RAM, 100 gigs of Hard drive space, Road Runner cable (not so) high speed internet access, Turtle Beach: Santa Cruz soundcard and a Matrox G200 Mystique 8mb video card.\n  Ok I'll put it this way, Microsoft's Windows ME does not let me use my computer to its best of performance capabilites. Win Me is slow and it looks like a direct rip off of Windows 2000. Well not that, that is a bad thing, Win 2k is at least a stable operating system that is powerful (to say the least).\n  Windows ME just runs about as fast as a turtle, and it is system resource hungry. I constantly have to restart whenever I do any multitasking. When there are multiple web browsers open, you can kiss half of your resources good bye. I have a lot of .dll (dynamic library link) failures when I multitask and my system just runs terrible. Once most of your memory is used up, if you don't restart... Then your internet speed will cut in half and folders take their time to open. I was also not a big fan with the networking capabilities on WIN ME. It almost looks as if Microsoft took Windows 98 ripped out have of the networking abilities and then threw WIN 2k icons on top of it, therefor creating Windows ME.\n  To put it nicely, I am really dissapointed with this OS. I was overall impressed with Windows 98 Second Edition and I still prefer it now. But to tell you the truth, I was really excited when I heard Microsoft was releasing WIN ME. I had a lot of high hopes that were really let down. I don't even know what went wrong, but Microsoft really screwed this one up!\n  I hate WIN Me and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. But, I will let you know that there are a few good points to it and I can see how others might enjoy it. WIN ME is very easy to navigate and very user friendly. There are a bunch of new options in Windows Media Player, which I'm sure a lot of people will like (although, I dislike Media Player myself). The overall appearence to Millenium is nicer. I really enjoy the look of it, as opposed to the old 98 and 95 series. What do I mean by that? I mean the desktop and menues. It is set up a bit nicer and the new icons look more upbeat. Although they are nothing new, everything came from Windows 2000. Oh yeah, try and restart in MS DOS Mode, you can't... Because it's not there! Microsoft decided to leave DOS out of WIN ME, except for the DOS prompt inside Windows. But overall, there is just nothing in Win Me to keep me running it. It took me a month or so to make my decision to go back to WIN 98 SE on a dual boot with Mandrake Linux 7.1\n  My recomendations are to either stick with Windows 98 Second Edition or with Windows 2000. If you are looking for a fast OS with stability, it is best to stay away from Win ME. If you have it in ya, learn Linux... Linux is fast, powerful, stable and fun once you get into it. But do your self a favor, stay away from Microsofts newest operating system Windows ME - Millenium Edition, or try it out first to decide for yourself. I didn't care for it in the least bit. I would give it 1 star, but I know it doesn't really deserve that. Hey, at least it runs... Thats about all I could ask from it. But the truth is, WIN ME just plain sucks. There isn't much to it that I like, I would probably never go back to it and most of my friends feel the same way. Actually, just about everyone I have talked to, who hava ran Windows ME disliked it. Read what other people have wrote. Most of them dislike it too! Honestly, I'd stay away!\n  I hope I gave some of you a bit of information that is useful. I'm not trying to bash Microsoft because they are the industry standard, because I'm not. I just wanted to provide you all with my point of view about the way I feel and my experiences with their new program. I am awaiting the next version of WIN ME (whatever they'll call it). I'd be more than happy to run it too. Plain and simple; I didn't care for WIN ME and I wanted everyone to know where I stand =) Hope that did it for ya!

Unfortunately, Reader Rabbit Math, though it has some fun games, is a relic of an earlier era of educational software, and is difficult to install on a modern system, such as Windows XP.  Reader Rabbit Math is an adaptation of an earlier game called Math Rabbit, and as a result, has some compatibility issues.\n\nBoth Reader Rabbit and Math Rabbit make an appearance in this title, as operators of two halves of a math carnival.  Unlike the Learn To Read With Phonics series, there is no story arc for this math game, so it lacks the imaginative adventure that may help motivate some youngsters to keep going.  This title is more like a conventional computer game, in which players play various math-based games to accumulate points.  The two halves of the game are patched together somewhat awkwardly, and when a player  chooses to play the Math Rabbit half, the screen area of the game actually shrinks by about 25%, perhaps reflecting older code that was written for display adapters with much lower resoltion than is available today.  Also unlike Learn To Read With Phonics, the software makes players choose what level of difficulty they want to set for each of the games every time you play, rather than keeping track of a player's progress and adjusting the difficulty automatically, while keeping these configuration settings away from access by the youngsters.\n\nWhen using the software with Windows XP, the program needs to run in Windows Compatibility mode.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Office is far and away the best thing Microsoft does, and probably the main reason for their dominance in the software industry.  The Mac OS X version of Office is generally regarded as superior to the Windows version, so this is the very best version of all.  Having used a trial version for a month, I have to admit that it is in many respects very impressive.  Although it occassionally misbehaves, for the most part it works splendidly with the OS X operating system.  The interface is very nice: it looks better even than Apple's office suite, Appleworks.  It does sometimes hog a little more CPU when it's open but not being used, but that's typical of 3rd party carbon ports.\nDespite the many fine qualities of his app, I cannot give it a complete endorsement.  I suspect that many people buy MS Office because of its prestige and its dominance in the market, not because they necessarily need it.  If you rarely use spreadsheet, don't really need to make presentations, and don't need all the extra features of MS Word, then you don't need this application.  Excel and Powerpoint are industry standards.  If you're in business and you need such things, those are the ones to have.  If you're not, you don't really need them.  The spreadsheet and presentation program that comes with Appleworks will do fine.  (Or if you don't have Appleworks, install XDarwin and use gnumeric or KOffice for free.)  As for MS Word, well, to tell the truth, I prefer the Appleworks: it's simply easier to use.  In all the times I've used Appleworks, I've never had to go to the help browser to figure out how to accomplish something.  With MS Word, even a simple task such as changing or realligning paragraphs requires a visit to the annoying little help box.  While I recognize the awesome power of the program, I just don't need anything quite that sophisticated.  I suspect that there are a number of people out there who shell out the big bucks for MS Word or Office but who don't really need its power.  There's no reason for that.  Nor is there any reason to buy it just so you can open us MS Word documents.  Appleworks, Abiword, and OpenOffice will open all but the most sophisticated word docs.  As for those they can't open, well, let's face it:  Mac and Linux users really need to begin putting pressure on people to send documents in file types that use open standards, like rtf and PDF.  There's no reason why non-Windows users should cooperate in extending Microsoft's dominance in the market.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The software provides a nice start if you want to learn spanish, but it does not deliver a complete course up to a certain level. The set up is that you start talking about business and technology pretty quick, without having received any grammar and practice that comes with that. You learn words and basis phrases first, but only in the present tense. Past tenses or other tenses are not being explained, which is in my opinion more important than talking business (if I would go and talk business in spanish, I would like to know how to make proper phrases in general, before I can actually worry about business talk).\nThe word practice and the games are really good and very easy to use. It is also sort of \"fun\" so it does motivate a lot to do it.\nThe phrases however are a bit slow and a bit confusing, the words are first spoken in English and even I who does not speak any spanish (yet) can notice that the translations are not very accurate (which is in my opinion a very important thing in a language course). Since they don't explain anything else, about the grammar, it is a bit confusing when the phrases are not very correct. For example, the English voice says; What soup do you have? The spanish translation to that is: \"Tiene sopa?\" which I think means: Do you have soup? and has nothing to do with what kind of soup they have......After that the answer is followed, but only in Spanish and is not translated in the help language. There is a picture in the screen however, with some sort of vegetable soup, but the answer is \"Hoy tenemos sopa de ajo casera\" which I think is quite complicated to figure out that their answer is that they have soup (from the house or home made) with garlic!\nThis course is nice to learn vocabulary and to have on the side, but you do need a proper book or classes to get into the real conversational spanish, because just with this, it is not possible to learn all of that. I feel sorry for people who bought Rosetta Stone and spend so much money on this (since the reviews do acknowledge that it provides quite the same), because I do think that for this price, this is really a good product, they just should promise a bit less than they do now, and they should sell it as a great vocabulary builder, which it really is.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As others have noted, this is an excellent way to learn spoken Chinese.  However, there are many errors in the written sections that will end up teaching Chinese students the wrong things if they don't have other resources to fall back on, and endlessly frustrate those students who do know the proper usage.\n\nSome reviewers have criticized the lack of translations.  However, this is an immersion program, and so that is something that should be expected.  It can be daunting to approach the first lessons, but there are enough clues in the pictures and variations on usage that you soon figure things out.  More importantly, because you are forced to figure things out it is easier to remember what you've learned.  This is a big point in Rosetta Stone's favor for those students who are seriously interested in actually remembering what they learn.\n\nThe spoken part is quite good.  While the speakers use a Beijing style accent, it is not a heavy one.  The student should pick up a more universal  speaking style than other programs which use a heavy Beijing accent which can make one hard to understand in other parts of the Chinese speaking world.  The speech is very clearly spoken, and is slow enough to be easily understood but not so slow as to be unrealistic.\n\nAt first the written portion looks very encouraging.  Rosetta Stone offers the options of using Hanyu Pinyin with tone marks, simplified Chinese (used in China and Singapore), or traditional Chinese (used in Hong Kong and Taiwan).  However, there are numerous mistakes which, if the student is unaware of them, will lead to learning incorrect information.\n\nFirst with the traditional Chinese, many words in the traditional Chinese option are written using simplified Characters instead.  In Unit 1 alone you have feiji (airplane) written in both traditional and simplified characters in different places, and mianbao (bread), pingguo (apple), huluobo (carrot) and gan (doing) are consistently presented in simplified characters.  If someone is considering using Rosetta Stone to learn traditional Chinese characters, there are enough mistakes that you probably should take a pass.\n\nNormally if you've selected the simplified or traditional character options, you'd never see the pinyin characters at all.  However, in the written test portion, only pinyin is tested for.  This may seem like a drawback but it is also a good way to test you on which tones are used.  It would be nice if they allowed entering actual Chinese characters in the written portion though.\n\nWhen learning spoken Chinese getting the correct tones is extremely important.  Of course, good listeners can pick up the tones just from listening, but most Chinese language students need additional help and reinforcement on the proper usage of tones.  Using pinyin with tones in the written test portion would be a good way to do this.\n\nAgain, though, we run into mistakes and inconsistencies.  As a very basic example, ge (counting word) is used quite frequently in the pinyin as fourth tone.  However, most of the time the proper usage is to use the neutral tone (it can also be used in fourth tone in some cases, but not in the cases they use it).  To further confuse things, sometimes they properly use ge in neutral tone in exactly the same usage where a few screens before they used it incorrectly in fourth tone!\n\nThere is an additional problem in inconsistent placement of the tone mark.  The tone mark is placed above a vowel in the word.  If there are more than one vowel, such as the word zai (at), there are various rules for where to put the tone mark.  However, it is usually considered unimportant for the student to remember exactly which vowel to place the tone mark on.  It's much more important just to know which tone should be used.\n\nThe written test portion uses a unique method for entering pinyin with tone marks.  A more common system would be to place the number of the tone at the end of each syllable, for example zai4 to indicate zai in the fourth tone, and either using 5 or omitting the number for neutral zone.  Instead, Rosetta Stone uses a system where the -, [, = and ] keys act as shift keys for tones 1-4 respectively.  In additiona for the special umlauted \"u\" letter in pinyin, the common method in other input systems is to use \"v\" to represent this character, however Rosetta Stone uses \"h\" instead.  These quirks are not too hard to get the hang of but it is regrettable that a more common input system wasn't used.\n\nGetting back to the mistakes, this system also means that the student must place the tone mark above the correct vowel when there is more than one.  Again, that's a rather nit-picking detail that will not add much to the student's knowledge of Chinese.\n\nBut even worse, consistency problems again crop up.  Again in the example of zai in the fourth tone, most teaching materials place the tone mark over the \"a\".  Rosetta Stone starts out in Unit 1 with the tone mark over the \"i\" instead, but in later units it switches to placing the tone mark over the \"a\".\n\nRosetta Stone by default uses 'strict' mode in the written test where tone marks need to appear exactly where they expect.  This increases the difficultly greatly for little learning benefit, and then frustrates the student by not following a consistent method of doing so.  Alternatively one can turn off strict mode, but then tone marks are not considered at all.  If the student wants to learn tones, he or she will need to put up with the frustration of also learning where to put the tone marks depending on which lesson you are on.\n\nThese are just some examples of incorrect or inconsistent usage in units one and two alone.  The number of such mistakes are present throughout the lessons.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with simplified Chinese to comment on the quality and consistency there.\n\nIt is frustrating and disappointing that such mistakes, problems and inconsistencies which should have been caught by the publisher have resulted in a mediocre product that could otherwise have been great.  With these problems it makes it very difficult and frustrating for the student to learn proper tones or traditional Chinese characters.\n\nBecause about half of the features are badly broken, and because the problems are not apparent to the beginning student, this product only gets 1/2 the possible score from this reviewer.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Good evening to all readers of National Geographic.\nI rate this product the full five stars because it is the only collection of all 120 years of Nat Geo available on web or library. Lets be fair, to own this much pure access for only $60 is a five star deal!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought mine at Best Buy for $59 and was told no returns on software, only an exchange. The many user comments are all true with reference to the lack of software sophistication. You need to have the necessary windows file knowledge to make the DVD's part of the hard drive at a generous 50GB of space. Several commenters refer to the Nat Geo FAQ page and this resource will give you the tools for a full integrated hard drive load.\nMy experience started with a twice crashed disk load. I had to uninstall it twice, change the update settings on the disk and the third time I was successful. To load the six DVD disks took over twelve hours with the last several disks taking the longest at several hours each. I have a 38\" LED monitor in tandem with three more 23\" monitors on my primary computer system. I do a great deal of computer and mathematics as a profession and will not simply give up on a software application because it is currently buggy. Do not give up either as this review states that the final product is worth five stars and Adobe Air will fix or improve all current software needs with a few more releases.\nHaving used the product extensively, it will stop responding in short time if you click on too many requests for page info without giving it time to load and move forward to the next request. I have a dual quad core system and it is the software as opposed to the hardware that is requiring Adobe to create a larger cache memory ratio for user throughput of info per page. It is pleasure to read the articles and use the google gadgets translator, currency converter and of course wikipedia to make sense out of the depth of content that is the hallmark of Nat Geo.\nImprovements would be a non sophisticated and bullet proof loading of disks to hard drive, a right click fuctionality to Explorer accelerators and an efficent transfer to Microsoft OneNote for those who want to write reports and summaries of a search. I hope Adobe will incorporate these requests in the future and I will continue to check for the updates in the product start screen. I recommend the larger over 30\" screen for viewing the wide pages. I have not experienced a sideways picture yet and this may be a simple solution. Large monitors are not expensive and the double magnify and Lupe feature give deep detail to many of the pictures. Good night and sweet Nat Geo dreams!", "label": 1}

I decided to install the BOOTMENU.exe provided at their site.

The manual that it ships with is over 700 pages because all but 50 pages are thumbnails of  the graphics. So you can look up in the book  where they are located but when you are searching for something in the program there is no place to type in say trees and get all the tree graphics{which is a feature in Print Shop and others}. You have to navigate thru channels so it takes much longer. If making mailing labels is in your plans, this software is really good at that BUT instead of just picking your Label Size via Avery number, they make that difficult by not listing all the numbers in a row. They are listed by holiday,personal etc. and each of those has SOME Avery numbers and under Blanks where all available label sizes should be it simply says  ALL . Then you have to navigate thru the pre-made ones to find your size. There isn't that many label sizes to choose from. So in this long winded way of saying its alot easier to pick there premade design and get that label at the store! It does have some nice features, like you don't have to have the CD in.

{"text": "Ok, this will be a somewhat lengthy review of this product, but I'm hoping it will help people decide whether to get it or not.  I've had this product for a few months now, almost 6 I believe.  And in that time, I've been satisfied with the editing software.  I decided mid last year to start a YouTube channel and wanted to get a video editing software to help me spruce up my vids.  I had been using Windows MovieMaker but it was so barebones and hard to work with when it came to large files that it wasn't up to snuff.  After searching and researching several different software packages, I decided to purchase this one.\n\nNow, the major factor in me purchasing this software were 2 reasons and they were the following; First, this editing software is actually Filmora Wondershare.  It is known to be a very easy program for beginners to use in order to get acquainted with video editing software.  The second being that the software doesn't require a super high end PC to work.\n\nI'm using a rather old but well taken cared of PC and this video editor works on it.  At the time I purchased the editing software, it functioned on both a 32bit or 64bit version of Windows.  Unfortunately, if you don't have a 64bit version of Windows, this will no longer work because of the recent update that was done to the editor.  Now, even though it does work with older PCs with 64bit versions of Windows, it doesn't mean that it will be a smooth experience.  Not saying that you will have constant crashes or anything, but you will notice a slower performance but that is because of the hardware.  It's not severe but it is noticeable and thus worth mentioning.\n\nWhen you receive the product it will come in a DVD like package with both the CD and an insert containing the registration information.  Now, if you don't have a way to use the CD on your PC, you can head over to Filmora Wondershare's website and download the editing software with the link they provide and then use the insert to register the product.  I've read some of these reviews where it says that the product is a trial version, now I'm not sure what they got exactly, but from my experience, the initial installed editor is a trial version but when you actually use the registration information that is provided, it removes any watermarks or requests to register the product.  Be aware that to register the software, it requires the PC to be connected to the internet in order to access the site's activation page. If you can't connect to the internet, you have to contact Filmora directly.\n\nLet's get to the actual software review, as I stated earlier, Filmora Wondershare is known to be a very easy to use video editor.  Many other video editors can be a bit complicated and overwhelm the user because it requires a bit of setup before actually using.  The beauty of Wondershare is that when you start the application, it prompts you to choose between various modes but the software still sets everything up for you.  So, if you choose the full mode, it sets everything up so that you can easily import your videos and drop them into the timeline to begin editing.  It has enough options for beginners to make their simple projects into professional looking ones.  You can splice, trim, insert transitions, overlay art that is provided by the software or your imported ones, add music, etc..  It has enough for a novice but more than enough for a beginner to tinker around with.  You can import a variety of different file formats, an exact list can be found on their website, I believe.  One of the great parts of the software is that you have enough options to render your file into several formats, from MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, GIF and many more.  Again, there is enough here for the beginner to the intermediate video editing user.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me about the software is this, if you actually use the CD to install the software, it is installing, at least the CD I had, an earlier version of Filmora's video editing software.  That version has several transitions and effects in it that are worthwhile to use, but once you register the product it will force download the newest version.  Well, with this newer version, you actually lose access to some of these older effects.  I contacted Filmora regarding this issue and the reply was not helpful, basically these old effects were removed because supposedly the new editor had trouble using these legacy effects so they removed them and cannot provide you a link to download them again.  Definitely sucked to hear that.\n\nI'm giving this product a 4 star rating simply because it is definitely recommended for someone that isn't familiar with video editing but want to start doing it for their projects or to start a YouTube channel.  For someone that has a ton of experience and has used other editors, that is another story.  Personally, if you like a ton of features this in no way will satisfy you as there simply isn't enough there.  For beginners it's plenty and a great way to learn.  Now, if you have used other editors and want something easier, this is it.  Last, I want to apologize for the long review, but again, I'd rather be as thorough as I can be to better help someone who is deciding to purchase this product.  Have a great day.\n\nEdit: Something that I forgot to add, for those that are wanting to know, yes, Filmora Wondershare can screen record.  It's not the best for my PC because it is older hardware, but I'm sure that people with newer PCs should have a smoother experience.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have been using NIS for a few years now.  I really liked the 2004 version and have had no major problems with it other than once my computer boots, I always had to go into NIS properties to see if my EMAIL SCANNING said 'ON' or 'ERROR'.  Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed 'ERROR' - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said 'error', the computer is still protected by the 'auto-protect' feature if it is turned on.  Minor inconvenience, but other than that, I was very happy with the program.\n\nThe same holds true for the new 2005 - I still have the occassional email scanning 'error', but there are a few new  irritating things happening.  While the software works fine, it has tremendously SLOWED DOWN the launch of Outlook Express and it even hangs a second or two when I close it.  Also, if you open NIS properties screen, when I am finished, I hit the X button to close, but it takes like 2-3 seconds before it will close.  Even though these are just a few seconds, it really irritates me because I have a very fast computer.\n\nHowever, something that really excites me about this new NIS is that the hard drive scan of all files by Norton Anti-Virus seems to take a lot less time than it did with a previous version.  Being a stickler for speedy computer processing, this is definitely a plus.\n\nSo, overall, this program works OK and keeps me protected, but I still think there are minor issues they need to work on as mentioned and I also think that the average computer user is not given enough information about whether to allow certain things when a firewall warning appears.  I know so many people that have blocked innocent programs and found that they are unable to use them or get on the internet.  There should be a way for NIS to know what is innocent and what should be blocked... the average computer user doesn't have the time to research what they should block or not - in fact, isn't that the reason we use computers?

{"text": "The very first route I planned with Microsoft Streets and Trips was from an address in Rochester, NY to an address in Sterling, Va.  The software took me east through Syracuse, on a 446 mile, 7 hour and 48 minute route.\nI *knew* it was better to go directly south, so I coached the software by telling it to add stops in Corning, NY and Harrisburg, PA.  Sure enough, now it found a 370 mile, 7 hour and 12 minute route.\nFurther experiments show that the software's \"shortest\" and \"quickest\" routes are often longer and slower than the routes you can force it to plot by adding well-chosen stops.  But of course if you know what route you want to force, you don't really need the software.\nI'm switching back to Delorme's Street Atlas.  I've been using Version 6.0, where the interface is truly awful but at least you get the right routes.  I'm hoping that in the current version 9.0, they've improved the interface and the underlying mapping algorithms are still as good as they've always been.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Back in the early 90's, I played a game called Oregon Trail II.  It was a fun game with great music, detailed art, decent animation and voice acting, as well as a lot of historical information.  It was a huge upgrade over the basic versions on Apple and early Windows, and I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nFast-forward to the 21st century, where Oregon Trail 5th Edition has been released for Windows XP and Vista.  Anyone who played OT2 (or related versions) will recognize this game just from the back of the box, but if you're looking for nostalgia, you'll be sorely disappointed.  If the game simply felt dated, that would've been a problem, but this version is actually a regression, not to mention broken.\n\nIf you can even get past the installation screens, you're greeted by a poorly animated opening to the game, before it takes you to the main menu.  This game has absolutely no changes to its setup from over a decade ago...even the actors and voiceovers used for the townsfolk are exactly the same (and most of them repeat the same lines at every stop).  The only actual \"upgrade\" is that the river crossing is now 3D instead of overhead, but it just feels out of place in a game that hasn't upgraded anywhere else.  Rafting, which probably needed the biggest upgrade of anything in this game, is still as ugly and clumsy to control as ever.\n\nThe only addition I noticed to this game was the cutscenes featuring a group of children and their trail guide, who are on their way to Oregon to meet up with the children's father.  These are poorly drawn, poorly animated, poorly acted and utterly pointless more often than not.  There's also the matter of the diary covering their own journey...I opened it up to read about a cut scene I missed, and the journal is already completely filled out to the end!  What's the point of that?  These scenes are so horrible, you might as well just read the journal and skip over the animations...you're not missing anything.\n\nAn even bigger disappointment is the music...most of it is missing.  OT2 had different pieces for certain scenarios, like reaching mountains, people dying, things going poorly, and especially the climatic final stretch towards Oregon...this game has none of these.  You could die, and the music will still play on cheerfully as if nothing had happened.  Even rafting the final river and reaching Oregon is anticlimatic because there's no victory music anymore.\n\nIf you can find a fixed version of this game, or even online upgrades to improve the version you bought at the store or through Amazon, it's worth the play, but if you're stuck with what comes in the box...and believe me, there's not much in there...you're better off searching for freeware.", "label": 0}

For example, during gameplay your character can get covered with green ooze and slows down. The only way to shake it off is by rapidly moving the thumb stick back and forth.

{"text": "First off, this is a fairly easy program to learn and use, even if you are a beginner at video editing. Capture from DV works like a charm. The program includes a decent amount of effects and transitions as well as many other features. This program is the only one I know of (in it's price range) that will allow you to do video overlays (i.e. picture-in-picture effects.) So overall, a great program for beginners. However, you will soon outgrow this software if you are serious at all about video editing. Some of the quirks that are frustrating to me are the fact that when you do an overlay, if you add another file or media to the main video track, your overlays do not \"stick\" in the timeline and are moved. This means you should complete the main video track before adding any overlays, or you will need to correct their timings later. Another thing I wish this program would let you do is add transitions between overlay tracks, and allow more than one overlay at a time.  Also, the DVD creation part of the program is very bare bones. The software has other quirks that bug me, but for the price, it does a good job.\nAfter using this program for a couple of weeks, I am already looking to upgrade to more robust video editing software. If you just want to make DVD's of your DV footage, this is a good choice. It just has some limitations.", "label": 2}

The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.  Additionally, GLO sends its audience updates for contents and historical facts.", "label": 1}

{"text": "UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows.  Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.\n\nNational Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.\n\nSince these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.\n\nThese maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.\n\n  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work. I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps.\n\n  The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions. For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen. You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button. The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is. Another observation is that there is no EDIT menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications. But these are relatively small concerns that you can quickly adapt to.  All in all this is a very valuable tool that I highly recommend.", "label": 1}

There are a few points that ought to be noted:\n\n>>The CNG has poor quality control and customer support over this product. It relies heavily on customer feedbacks to become aware of missing pages and issues, and took very long time (18 months) to address few of the reported bugs. The Complete National Geographic will be incomplete with missing items such as:\n- Jul 1942 and Feb 1992: Pages missing, causing pagination problems in the issues with double page spreads not appearing on facing pages.\n- Mar 1996: Page 35 is missing.\n- From 1991 to 2008, at least 30 maps are reported missing. Examples: The World War II double map supplement is missing from Dec 1991. The Sep 2000 map is missing. The \"100 Years of Flight\" supplement in Dec 2003 is missing. The Jerusalem's Holy Ground map is missing in Dec 2008.\n\n>>The Complete National Geographic contains National Geographic Magazine published through Dec 2008. National Geographic announced \"The Complete National Geographic\" users will be able to add to their collection after purchasing the product by downloading annual updates on a subscription basis from the internet. Content updates for CNG will be available after the print editions of the previous year have been published. CNG released an updated edition of this DVD set and a 2009 annual update DVD ($14.95) in Sep 2010. The feature to purchase annual updates online wasn't ready until CNG patch 1.65 (requires Adobe Air 2.6) released in Apr 2011. Content update purchases have to be made through the CNG software interface. Stand alone archive files for the purchased content updates may not exist for archive and repeat/multicomputer installation.\n\n>>Updates need to be installed to add missing or fix corrupted pages such as in Apr 1913, Dec 1930, Mar 1950, Apr 1953 (entirely missing), Sep 1960, Aug 1970, Jan 1977, Jul 1979, Feb 1992, Feb 1993, and Dec 2003 issues. However, updates have to be downloaded and installed through the software interface; there isn't an independent update installer for archive and repeat installation.\n\n>>Either the digital magnifier that comes with the software or the maximum zoom needs to be used to clearly read the texts on your monitor. An ASCII text PDF resolution of the scanned pages shouldn't be expected.\n\n>>The patch (revision 1.26) to copy DVD content to local drive was released for Windows in Jan 2010.

{"text": "Please don't take offense the title of this review. I just wanted to get your attention. I do not claim to be smarter than you, just more expert in foreign language teaching and learning. Full disclosure: I have taught French since 1967.\n\nMy first issue with this product is that the sequence of lessons, suitable for Romance Languages (I found Italian and Spanish very useful), works much less well for German. German is not  Portuguese or French. It, like Latin, has three genders. Nouns are declined. The agreement of articles and adjectives with nouns is, initially, quite daunting. As a result, Rosetta Stone German lesson presenting elementary concepts frequently require the learner to employ more advanced words and forms with which he/she is unfamiliar. That makes a correct response practically impossible. A recipe for frustration? Obviously. Why do it this way? Because that order of presentation works so great for French, of course!\n\nI have already studied German (that was 48 years ago, but I still recall a ton, although I don't know where my keys are), so this program is fine for me. i know where the bodies are buried. This is by way of warning you that you had better have a firm grasp of English grammar, or be a language professor, or be exceptionally adept at language learning, or you will never use this application after an initial, disillusioning try.\n\nTechnically, I've found minor glitches during the first couple of hours of use: e.g., instead of the sequence prompt - time to answer - verification, one lesson has time to answer -prompt- verification. Minor, but initially confusing to me, who have written many language exercises. What would a novice would make of it?  Not very much, you can be sure.\n\nThe worst thing about Rosetta Stone products is that the company sees itself as an adversary of language learners, not an ally. They are offensively defensive over their intellectual property. To study Italian, I had to schlepp around a fragile DVD from home to work to weekend home. Spanish was fine. But installing German has been pure torture: Rosetta Stone is not allowing me to install German in Princeton for weekend use. And Rosetta has intentionally or accidentally created an infinite loop: you are told that you can use some of the features without registering the product. Just try! Prepare to be enraged.\n\nRosetta Stone throws around nickels like manhole covers. Prices are way high. Substandard language teaching techniques abound. Hire a first-rate teacher for each language, not just clueless native speakers. Were I running the show, I would work much harder on making my software perfect and my customers happy. We've all seen how Apple does it.\n\nRosetta Stone is technologically on the right track. Pedagogically, not so much. These are computer people, not language teachers. Otherwise, they would never  fail to approach each language as a unique challenge to learners; a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach respects neither the language nor the student.\n\nI have no better suggestion than Rosetta Stone for learning materials for German. Beginners, buy only level one. If you can work with it, good for you! Buy the whole course. It's wonderful to learn a new language. I seriously doubt, however, that one student in ten will be able and willing to stick it out to the end of the first level. And that is a terrible shame.", "label": 0}

{"text": "There are two reasons to buy recipe software. The first is for the recipes. I did not buy the software for the recipes and I have not tried any recipes. I bought it for the second reason: to manage my recipes using their software. Generally the software works and it is better than the old DOS based software that I have used for years. There are some problems:\n1) When printing, you can not specify how many copies you want. Each time you print, you must go through the whole routine.\n2) Once you assign a recipe to a category, it stays. As far as I can tell you can not unassign a category.\n3) The documentation is poor. The user has to be willing to experiment to figure out how it works. For example, the \"Close\" button is really a \"Save and Close\". If you use the little x in the upper right hand corner, nothing is saved.\n4) On my computer, the mouse is deactivated whenever a pop-up box appears. To get my mouse working again, I have to press the tab key. This is true for the print box, the intro box, the exit box, etc...\nI e-mailed DVO about problems 2 and 4. For problem 2, I received no response (I sent 3 e-mails on this problem). On Problem 4, I received a prompt response requesting more information. I responded. I waited. After a couple of weeks, I was told that I my problem is unique. It might be my mouse driver. I downloaded a new mouse driver from Microsoft. No change. I have over fifty programs on my system. The only place this problem appears is on DVO software. I may have a system problem, but, something DVO is doing is contributing.\nThis software is better than my old software. The software does have some nice features such scaling the menu for the number of servings requested and allowing photographs to be attached to recipes. I will continue using it but I have not ceased looking for better program. Maybe DVO will read this and fix the weaknesses.\nI never tried the software with my PDA since it does not work with Pocket PC's. It likes the Palm OS.\nThe menu planner seems to work.\nNOTE:\nAfter I posted this review, DVO sent me an e-mail on how to delete categories from recipes.  It works, but the documention still is missing this piece of information.", "label": 2}

After 4 months, I unistalled version 5 and returned back to the good old version 4 for the following reasons:\n1) Version 5 platinum tends to crash when writing CDs; in my experience, it damaged about one CD out of every 5 that I burned. The program would start writing, and then would give an error message that an internal error has occured, thus rendering the CD useless. The error message is so generic and obscure that I could never figure out what was the reason of the problem.\n2) After you use the CD-writing program or the CD-copier, the Direct-CD driver stops working, cannot be unloaded, and prevents Windows 2k from shutting down properly.\n3) The interface is more confusing than in the version 4. Many features are duplicated in an \"easy\" and \"advanced\" versions of essentially the same thing. The program seems to be working slower than version 4 (it appears that it reads from CD-ROM with the same speed as it would write on it). Retrieval of the track lists from the Internet does not always work.\nI tried installing all patches available on the web, but without success.\nThe only two things which I really liked about this program is the built-in mp3 encoding/decoding, and a significantly improved jewel case creator.

First off, it says it only needs DirectX 4 but it comes with DirectX 7 which would not install on the machine. One must have an updated computer to run this game, or have a copy of DirectX 4 lying around. Now since my son has been using a computer for as long as he has, he has learned that keys do different things and every key has an association with the Fisher Price game, and in general computer usage. With this game, everything is controlled. The key strokes do commands that the program wants to run, and completes tasks FOR the child rather than initiating them to complete the task by pressing the correct buttons. My son gets bored with this game since it doesn't matter what key he presses it does what the program wants to do, not what my son wants to try, and the game stops and sings and won't let him do anything. My son is used to more control. The Fisher Price game actually associates the letter A with the letter A for example, so I believe he is actually learning more from a straight keyboard than this game. My son is now 20 months old. When we got this game he was 18 months old, and he was off and away on the Fisher Price keyboard at 13 months. I was looking for another game just as good if not better, or more interactive to help him grow, but I would rather see an old fashion typing game that teaches him the letters on the keyboard or something more interactive that lets him control the game, not the game controlling him.\nAnd according to the system requirements my computer should be able to run the game, but I am still having a hard time finding DirectX get the computer game to run :(", "label": 0}

{"text": "This software is VERY basic and does not offer a whole lot of capability.  I sync it with a Garmin Foretrex 101, which does not have mapping capabilities.  My plan was to map out cycling routes on the software and import them into the GPS.  However, the trip and waypoint manager only has major roads (Interstates and some US highways) available for navigating.  It also only has major bodies of water.  It is nice software if you just want to keep track of where you've been and how to get there again, but don't plan on creating routes from scratch (unless, of course, you have predetermined the lat/long coordinates).", "label": 2}
{"text": "I've been using this software for about three months now and have installed it on seven or eight different machines that I maintain, and honestly, the best I can say is that the actual upgrade process is very smooth--this Office suite comes on one CD instead of two, it scans for previous versions, offers full installation options, and explains very clearly what it is doing. When I upgraded to Office 2000, the software took upwards of an hour; with XP, the upgrades took from ten to forty minutes, depending on the speed of the machine I was upgrading to.\nYou will first notice how nice everything looks and the new \"Smart Pane,\" which is supposed to be a window with what Office thinks you will want to do. The contents of this pane include your most recently used documents and options to create new documents.\nThe menus look a lot like the DHTML effects common on many web sites--menu options are \"highlighted\" when you mouse over them. A few other things have changed, but the changes are mostly cosmetic.\nThe Smart Pane, which is really more of a \"pain\" than a \"pane,\" is obtrusive to me--I am what is called a \"power user,\" i.e., I use MS Office for about four hours a day, rely on it, and am very familiar with it. When I open an application, I want wide, open space. I often close the Smart Pane without using its features, instead opening documents the way I have for years-either by opening them from the Work menu I added or by clicking to them. This Smart Pane is supposed to close when you open something, but sometimes it doesn't, meaning I have to click to close it.\nWorse, the Smart Pane automatically opens when you want to do something it thinks requires many options. For example, if I want to modify a style in Word, the Smart Pane appears and offers me myriad options for editing my styles. This whole process of opening the Smart Pane slows everything down (I'm running a Pentium III 933 mHz with 128 mb RAM and a 7200 rpm ultra ATA hard drive with relatively few applications installed; got to keep it clean!!).\nEditing styles provides a good example of how bloated the software is. You may recall from Office 2000 that all the styles were either built in or created by the user. Now, however, XP creates new styles based on what it finds in your document. For example, if you have a italicized one of your Heading 1s, XP will show the regular Heading 1 style and the Heading 1 style with italics. Imagine how many such styles you might have in your document; with these new additions, XP has easily doubled or tripled the number of styles I must wade through to get the one I want.\nXP slows down every machine it's loaded on. My oldest machine, a Dell Pentium 75 running Win 98, was still chugging along quite nicely, even with Office 2000 installed. Now, however, after I've installed XP on it, it moves so slowly that it's almost laughable-clicked buttons bubble up comically. The worst part is that the computer is much, much slower, even if I'm not using any of the XP applications. I guess there's too much XP stuff now running in the background.\nI have a few gripes with Word, many related to printing problems, but one is particularly laughable, typical of Microsoft. Now, when Word crashes, it politely tells you that it has done so and offers to send a report of the problem to Bill. It swears that it won't send any personal data. The first few times I saw this, I thought, sure, why not, send it, maybe it'll help. Hah! Each time, without fail, my computer froze! So, instead of having just one program crash, I ended up with a frozen machine. Remember, I'm primarily using a new, major name machine with little other software installed. Learned not to do that real quick!\nThere is one change I do like in Word. Since I do a lot of editing for a living, I find the new style of showing comments much better than the previous method. In Office 2000, comments were shown as \"sticky notes\" that appeared when you moused over them. Now, however, the comments appear as neat rounded squares in the margin. They look good on the screen and they print out well for others to read.\nAnother major reason I upgraded was because of a fatal flaw in FrontPage 2000. I have detailed more of this problem in my review of FP2002, but essentially, FP2000 could not publish my web site because it was too large. I was hoping that the bundled FP2002 would have fixed that bug. It did, but it has other compatibility issues that MS hasn't been able to resolve with most web hosts.\nMy relatively low rating is for the upgrade, not for the overall quality of the product. The product, which crashes at least as frequently as Office 2000, seems to be no more functional than its predecessor, meaning that the upgrade is necessary only for those who want to have the latest thing. The best news is that I've learned how to take advantage of MS's support discussion groups. The answers and workarounds I found in those groups were a thousand times more helpful than MS's pitiful Help or canned tech support messages. Again: Don't pay for support-go to their support groups for help first.\nIn short, this is something of a \"non-upgrade,\" and will most likely cause more problems than it will fix.", "label": 2}

Turn your back and Intuit will snatch more of your cash, whether it's for an unnecessary upgrade, a support call, or an add-on service you really don't need.\n\nBeware signing up for Quicken Bill Pay. The screen that keeps popping up encouraging you to sign up with a BillPay free trial can be confused with a registration screen. For that and other reasons, it's not unusual for people to inadvertently sign up for BillPay twice or even three times.\n\nDoes Intuit contact you given that they are billing the same person two or three times for the same product? No. When you discover the error and then ask Intuit for a refund or to credit your account for the double (or triple) payments, they point to the legal fine print, which of course their attorneys have crafted in such a way to protect Intuit from any legal challenges to their extra revenue scheme.\n\nIf I didn't already have a lot of data on Quicken I would look at Microsoft Money.

{"text": "I've been a user of Dramatica since earlier versions. And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you!  When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons. Come on now.\n\nOn to the software, I like the storyforming tools. But really the terminology at points is obscure. When it says my main character's \"thematic opposite to the area of John's greatest sensitivity concerns willingness to reevaluate\" it would be nice if I didn't have to refer to the manual to figure out what that means.  I'm not a dummy, but I would like to be able to use the software without having to refer to the HELP.\n\nOverall, I LIKE Dramatica Pro. But its by no means an easy App to work with.

{"text": "This version of Works Suite offers almost the same exact features of version 2004. The only difference is Money, Streets and Trips, Picture It! 10.0, Encarta, they included version 2005 instead. For users who might have stuck with version 2000, 2001 or 2002 of Works Suite, this will suit you more. The collection of software included is amazing for the value at which it is being offered. From powerful and easy to use Word Processing solutions such as Microsoft Word and quality photo-editing with Picture It! My only problem with Word is that they did not include version 2003 instead. Word 2002 is included instead and has been out since May 2001, kind of lame by Microsoft's standards. This is a recommend set of programs for the home user and some businesses who need only the essentials. The package includes Works 8.0, with basic spreadsheet and database applications. You also get great money management solution; Money 2005 makes it a synch to keep your budget on track and in tact. With its online integration you can pay bills online or get further information to better manage your financial data. These applications I still consider not to be as strong enough as Microsoft Excel and Access. The database in Works approach to creating queries is limited and unreliable. The Spreadsheet does not offer the powerful calculation tools found in Excel and integration between both applications is very limited. But if you need only the essential tools for managing the essential aspects of your life whether at home or school Works Suite 2005 is truly a bargain. Getting the latest versions of Encarta is always great and it includes version 2005, so information is once again updated and accurate and you get the benefits of updating it weekly, so your information is never outdated.\n\nRemember if you are a user of Works Suite 2003 or 2004, this update might be unnecessary to you because the majority of the products in version 2003 have not had a drastic overhaul in version 2005.

On \"full Install\" it tells you that you will need to use the 2nd CD (with the Art and Fonts) to finish installation, BUT it never asks for it.  Installation completed with bare minimum artwork and the 2nd CD will not autorun in any computer I tried it on. It's very time consuming to try to find a graphic on the 2nd CD because there are too many folders!\n\n2. The images are not \"common\" file names so you cannot import them to another program from the CD either. Basically - I can't use the artwork CD unless the CD is in the drive, which is not a possibility for me at all times, especially while listening to music.\n\n3. Inserting New Pages - When the program starts it gives you the option to pick from a list of pages to use as templates for your first page.  Unfortunately, once the first page is done you can't go back to pick from the templates for page 2. Your only options are to start a blank page, or duplicate the same page. This is a problem if you want one book with more than one type of page.\n\n4. Cutesy artwork - the box that I purchased shows many examples of elegant looking scrapbook pages, but from what I can see of the artwork included, the templates are filled with cartoonish characters and designs.  I was unable to find one template suitable for an adult birthday party, or adult get together.  While there is a LOT of artwork, I would personally not use most of it.\n\nIf I were to say anything positive about this program, it's that it comes with many other features that it doesn't list on the box, such as a calendar maker, journal pages and label maker, etc.  However I would have much rather skipped those \"freebies\" if it meant I got a higher quality product for what I want to use it for - no-nonsense scrapbooking.

They finally gave up and told me to seek local support.\nIt is amusing, though to work with tech support that is obviously contracted out to a foreign country.  They rely on auto-formatted responses in which they plug in a few words from your message.  The result is very awkward communications from them, and a constant reassurance:  \"I am sure that following these steps will resolve your problem.\"  Not very reassuring after four or five failed attempts.\nSorry this is so long.  The point is that I, like many others it seems, am extremely disappointed with this product and Mcafee.  I will never trust them again.\nI have just ordered the latest from Norton.  It seems Mcafee VirusScan 6.0 is the best advertising Symantec ever had!", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'll defer the whole \"Office\" review to the multitudes of others and focus on the subscription licensing model, which is the core of the O365 vs Office retail difference.  With the regular retail package you pay once and apply the license to one device (and if you're like me have a lot of difficulty switching that license to another PC if you ever replace the original.  With this version of O365 you pay PER YEAR, but always have the latest version, have online storage, and (key for me) INSTALLATION ON UP TO 5 DEVICES.  There is also a \"Personal\" version of O365 for $65 that installs on 1 device - this to me is a waste; if you're only putting on 1 device you'll probably be better suited for the regular Office package.\n\nAt $73 I found the Office 365 Home Premium 1yr Subscription Key Card to be an excellent value because of our situation and the 5-PC allowance.  I have my own laptop, and each of my 2 kids have 2 laptops - one that stays at my house and another that stays at at their mother's.  In the past this meant buying 5 different licenses, and go through the pain of trying to swap activations from one pc to another if we replaced their computers every 3 years.  It was possible, but also a pain to set them up and change their behavior to use online document storage so that they could access files whether there or here.  (as a side note to offset those \"why don't you just have them carry their laptops back and forth?\" - one word \"breakage\").\n\nAnyway, it's pretty easy to get set up so that our 5 PCs are all up to date with current versions with the software that they need for their schoolwork, and the online storage is seamless and well integrated so they can always access their files whether they are at their mother's house or mine.\n\nThe subscription model worked well for us.  A Basic Office package per PC is $110 - if you are like our situation and have a houseful of devices that's $550, and then expect to pay that again when the newer version comes out or you replaced a PC and had problems getting the licenses migrated to another PC.  Add in the online cloud storage access ease and it definitely improves the cost/convenience model.  Works on PC/Mac and iPads.  I was recently doing extensive business traveling and moved one of my licenses from my laptop to my iPad temporarily while I was more mobile yet still wanted basic edit access to Office package.  When I was back and things settled down I was able to easily switch back again.  Which is of note - if you want to use the Office package for more than viewing and actually need to create/edit Office docs on your iPad you are going to need an O365 license.\n\nIf you are a single device user by all means I think the regular Office license is likely to be best for you.  However, I think if you have multiple devices this makes for a great deal.", "label": 1}

I learned a lot of Japanese learning in Japan, but it's not always possible to just go to a country to cement or start your language skills so I picked up the Spanish version. The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded. It doesn't look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all.\n\nI still think these are interesting to start with if you don't have an old version.

{"text": "Okay, it works.  That's the good news.  The program does what it was programmed to do.  Otherwise is is awful.\n\n  Our four year old has been using the program for about a week now and we hate it.  She enjoys the stories and the general layout of the game but has a very hard time with the actual tasks.  I sat with her and tried to help only to find that I had a hard time with it as well.\n\n  In every \"letter world\" there are a list of things you have to complete.  First you click on four things in the picture that start with the letter you are looking for.  Then you go into the cart with the hamsters.\n\n  In the hamster cart you have three tasks.  The first is to correctly identify the word that the hamster says from three possibles.  The problem is that the hamster is very hard to understand as he sounds like a hamster rather than a well articulated person trying to teach a small child.\n\n  The next section is a fill in the blank area.  There are three pictures of three letter words (cat, bus, etc.).  Under the words are three blanks.  Some of these blanks are filled in but not with letters that belong in the word!!!  Sometimes there are X's in the spaces, sometimes random other letters and sometimes they are all blank.  Then, with NO OTHER INSTRUCTION WHAT SO EVER, you are given 5 letters and expected to fill them in.  The problem is that you are expected to fill in only the first, last or middle letter and they don't tell you which they are looking for.  I can do this game.  I know how to read and how to spell small words like bus.  My daughter is learning to read and doesn't understand when looking at the words \"dog, gum and bus\" that the computer is looking for her to fill in the last letter just based on the available choices.  She starts sounding out the word dog and wonders why there isn't a \"d\" in the pile to choose from.\n\nWhen you leave the hamsters you go to the book section where the computer reads you a small story.  This is fine except that on some of the pages the computer won't let you go to the next page until you click on something in the picture.  But it doesn't tell you what it wants you to click on.  My daughter's answer to this has been to randomly click all over the picture so that she can hear the rest of the story.  It works but I hardly think it's teaching her anything at that point.\n\nI think this is a worthless program that has confused her much more than it has helped.  It seems as though the people writing it forgot that the target audience doesn't know how to read.  When you are trying to teach someone who doesn't know how to read you need to speak clearly and slowly.  You need to be consistent and you need to tell them what they need to do.

{"text": "Sometimes when I find myself critiquing Nancy Drew games, I realize how much variety this series has, while still never really moving it's roots; The sleuthing that we all love has relatively stayed the same, but the setting changes with every game. Whether it's a haunted mansion, or a ranch or even a train, HERInteractive takes on a new form of fun with each additional mystery, and while Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an older game in the series, and definitely not one of my favorites, there is still fun to be had with it, and orginiality is clearly evident.\n\nStory: 6.5/10. Nancy lands an internship at a museum in Washington D.C, which is devoted to the Mayan culture and will soon be exhibiting a newly discovered monolith to the public. But, shortly before the exhibition, one of the museum's most treasured pieces is stolen from the museum, as well as a strange 'accident' that occurs involving the museum's epigrapher. It definitely wasn't one of my favorite plots, but was still somewhat interesting.\n\nSetting: 6.5/10. It was definitely an interestingly original idea to have a Nancy Drew game take place in a museum specializing in Mayan culture. You also get to hope on a subway to visit other character's offices, a hospital and Nancy's hotel room. I personally thought that the museum was pretty boring, but maybe less boring as the game progressed, and I found things I didn't know were there before.\n\nCharacters: 6/10. The characters were pretty annoying this time around. The epigrapher who got amnesia was very irritating to care to and talk to, Taylor Sinclair, an art specialist, was very annoying, and Alejandro, an ambassador to the Mexican Consolate, was even more annoying to talk to.\n\nPuzzles: 8.5/10. The puzzles were good this time around, and the only reason I'm saying this is that there's a pyramid inside the museum, and on each level on this part of the museum, there are different quizzes and games that you have to complete to progress to the next floor. This was a big part of the game and I LOVED it.\n\nActivities: 6/10. There weren't that many activities, but the games in the pyrmaid were decent.\n\nEnding: 6.5/10. The ending was obvious, and what you had to do to end the game was kind of confusing, and took me a few tries to get it right.\n\nTotal (averaged): 6.6 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nAlthough this game does have some originality and fun, it's too bland and boring for my taste, and I'd recommend new HERInteractive fans to go with another purchase for now.", "label": 2}

You can draft the worst players and still win by 100 points.\nThe game starts by picking your team and making your coach name. Then, you can pick through an average amount of players for your team. It doesn't matter what their stats are. You'll still be undefeaten after the season. Then, you play the game. Why is this game so easy? But, the only thing keeping you from a 200-0 game is the fouls. They call an unbelievable amount of fouls. Can you move without getting a penalty?\nBut, after you turn the fouls off, it's not fun. But, it's not fun with fouls, either. That's a problem. If this game was harder, you'd have a great game. But, it's not hard, so it's not fun. It's fun to have KG on your team scoring dunks from half-court. You can substitute when a quarter gets over, but if you do it, the commentary doesn't pick a Player of the Game. That's a good thing about the game. Who will get the Player of the Game? The best player doesn't get the prize, though? It's usually the amateur player that scores 2 points.\nOh, well. There's NBA Street for a good power-uppy not real basketball game.

{"text": "Basically, you can make an exact backup of a DVD with DVDXCopy with just a couple clicks of your mouse. The only drawback is if your DVD movie is bigger than 4.38GB, which most of the movies nowadays are, then you will have to split it into 2 DVDR's. This can get both costly and annoying. So if you'd rather do a one-to-one DVD copy, then this is not the software for you. There are however other software(some freeware) out that can recompress the DVD so it will fit on a single DVD recordable. The best thing about them is you can choose the level of compression for different sections of the DVD. So you can essentially do a higher compression on the extra features and such while keeping the compression on the movie itself to a minimal to retain as much quality as possible. You can even remove entire unwanted sections or audio tracks. Some such programs are DVDShrink, Pinnacle Instantcopy, and DVD95Copy, to name a few. But if you don't mind splitting your DVD's into two, then DVDXCopy is definately the software for you.", "label": 2}

{"text": "If you're using Windows 2000 or Windows XP in a secure mode, to try and provide a second line of defense against viruses too new to be caught by your anti-virus software, Quicken 2002 will not make you very happy.  It still is really a Windows 95 application, and gleefully writes all over the application directory (C:\\Program Files\\Quicken) every time it starts up.\nIf you have user accounts on Windows 2000 that are \"Restricted User\" (in the Users group), the software will not run out-of-the-box.  You will have to modify the security on the application directory to add Modify and Write permissions for the Users group.  This, of course, means that any virus that gets into your computer can attack and infest any file that is part of Quicken.\nHaving the application directory be writeable was not \"safe computing\" when Intuit wrote Quicken many years ago, and it is not \"safe computing\" now.  Microsoft guidelines have you store all state under the user account in C:\\Documents and Settings.  It is telling that Quicken does NOT have any \"Windows logo\" certification from Microsoft.  Maybe Quicken doesn't trust Microsoft not to show the new version to the Microsoft Money people, but Intuit also must know that it would flunk the certification process horribly!  It is time to shame the application developers into making software that practices \"safe computing\", or we will be in virus hell forever.\nAt least I could make Quicken 2002 run at all for a \"Restricted User\".  Quicken 2001 tried to write to the Windows Registry every time it started, battling with Money over some file extension, there was no reasonable way to make that work.  Quicken 2001 would only work on accounts with \"Power User\" priveleges, which I refuse to grant my everyday account for virus-protection reasons.

{"text": "I'm not saying anything in this review that hasn't been said in many of the other reviews and in more detail.  After drooling about the CD-based offering of this product quite a few years ago, but not buying, I ran across this for $35 at an un-named retail chain, and I happily laid out the cash for it.\n\nWho hasn't spent hours and hours as a kid or even an adult, just thumbing through issue after issue of National Geographic, being transported to places and times so fantastic, they almost seemed like fairy tales.\n\nThe content of these disks is phenomenal.  Over 120 years of incredibly interesting and well-researched stories and content we've come to know and love from National Geographic Society, conveniently loaded on 6 DVD's, providing super-easy access for endlessly entertaining reading and browsing.\n\nBut that being said, that was the no-brainer portion of creating this product, which would be hard to get wrong.  The \"goods\" were there, they only needed to transform the media.  Just scan and digitize each page of roughly some 1400 issues.  Not a fun process, I'm sure, but easily doable with today's technology.\n\nNext step?  Determine some storage media that easily lets folks peruse that bountiful bunch of data.  DVDs are a logical choice given DVD players-readers are ubiquitous on PCs and laptops nowadays.\n\nLast step?  Design a user interface that lets people as efficiently and effectively as possible access and explore all that wonderful content they so painstakingly transformed into this digital format.\n\nAnd unfortunately, THIS is where they seriously dorked it up.  They had the Mona Lisa and bought a cheapo frame from Wall-Mart to put it in...yeah, that wry, semi-smirking face still looks good, but it's not the treatment the lady deserves.  Possibly inspired by some other software, it seems NGS decided to design a search and browsing interface from the ground up.  When it works, it's not a BAD interface, BUT IT'S BUGGY AS HECK!  It freezes half the time when I try to open a specific issue to browse (exiting the software and relaunching it usually fixes that).  The search engine/interface is frequently slow--and not just because of the DVD spin-up lag--and frequently freezes up as well.  I downloaded and installed the updates, and although it helped a bit, those aforementioned problems still exist.  When I activate the zooming bar to zoom in and out of the page image (which hovers over the page image), and I click on it to drag the zooming bar, it grabs and moves the page underneath it instead. They could have studied Microsoft Encarta (which isn't fabulous, but it is effective) or something similar and made a MUCH more usable interface.  Of course they could actually fix the bugs in this product as it is and EASILY improve it as well.\n\nWhat the heck was NGS thinking?  The only REAL work needed to make this a great product was a nice, stream-lined, browsing interface that let people simply enjoy the product they've slowly crafted over the last 120 years.  How could they ignore the last critical piece of the project, and rush this thing to market?  Ouch.  And given the fact other reviews indicated these problems from late last year (2009) and they STILL haven't been fixed as of May 2010, it's WAY bad mark on their reputation for quality that NGS should value more than this product indicates they do.\n\nLastly, I somewhat agree with the comments about the text quality.  Easily think it could have been better, but for me it's fairly readable after some zooming.\n\nEven with all the above-mentioned problems, and several content omissions ID'ed in several other reviews, this is a very good product.  But that's because of 120 years of hard work, the writers, photographers, and editors put into producing National Geographic...NOT the production team who put together this DVD product.  Had both parts been equally awesome (if that's even possible), 10 stars wouldn't have been enough for this product.  Shame on you NGS...get your act together.\n\nBottom line:  though problematic, for only $45 having 98% of ALL of the National Geographic issues at your finger-tips is too much to pass up.  If you've spent as many hours getting lost in National Geographic as I have, I expect you'll think so too...", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have been giving Life Application Study Bibles away for about 8 years now. The study notes are very good. On the top half of each page you have the actual text of Scripture. On the bottom half of each page you have the study notes. The study notes are brief descriptions/interpretations of each individual verse. Of course not all verses are interpreted for us, largely due to space constraints. All the major verses are covered. What's really neat about this bible is that the study notes really help you to see how any particular verse of Scripture applies to you personally in your day to day life. It breaks each verse down so that it's easy to understand. Hence the name Life APPLICATION Study Bible. Another neat thing about this bible is that this bible is really right about down the middle as far as Theology is concerned. It's a bible that pretty much all denominations can agree with. Anyone from Petecostal Assemblies of God types, all the way to the other side of Southern Baptist Conservative types, or middle of the road Calvary Chapel types and everyone in between can enjoy and apprecaite. The reason this bible can be appreciated by such a wide variety of groups is not at all because it's wishy washy on Theology but, rather, it's simply because it majors on application. That's what's so great about it. Everyone from a brand new believer all the way to a well seasoned Bible Teacher or Pastor can greatly benefit from the study notes in this bible.\n\nIf you are looking for a more Doctrinally or Theologically centered bible then I higly recomend John Macarthur's \"The Macarthurs Study Bible. Or if you're more the Pentecostal type more centered on the gifts of the Spirit, try The \"New Spirit Filled Bible\" by Jack Hayford. If you're more on the Calvanist, Reformed Theology type then try the \"Reformation Study Bible\" by R. C. Sproul. I believe Chuck Smith has also recently come out with his own Study Bible for you Calvary Chapel types.\n\nWith all that said, I still highly recomend this Life Application Study Bible.

{"text": "Star Trek Away Team, published by Activision, was an interesting premise gone awry.  Personally, I like tactical games where stealth and planning are essential to mission completion.  Heck, I just like building bases, preparing for an all-out assault and then blitzing my enemies as I throwing everything at 'em - which is why I like Blizzard's StarCraft and Activision's Star Trek Armada.\nTo be honest, I'm not much of a fan of squad-based game play but I am a big Star Trek nut so I thought, this might be cool.  Unfortunately, this game did little to change my original opinion.  Set in the time of The Next Generation, sometime after the Dominion War, Away Team focuses on the exploits of Captain Marcus Reflian, commander of a small experimental starship, the USS Incursion, and his group of highly skilled, individually selected crewmembers and their goal to uncover a nefarious plot that threatens every major power in the quadrant, including the seemingly invincible Borg.  Players must endure a linear progress through 17 missions.  The locales of each mission change, bringing you to Starfleet Academy, aboard Federation starships, Q'onos, and Romulus.  Even though the scenery changes game play does not.  While in single player mode, you command on average, 4 Federation crewmembers you chose for each mission.  Just after the mission briefing you must assemble your away team from the 17 crewmember choices.  Each mission has specific skill requirement that must be met in order to meet the primary objective, such as the need for a medical officer (or someone with medical training) and/or a crewmember that is experienced in using the sniper rifle.  Only after the skill requirements are met can you play the mission.  You must choose your away team from each of the five Starfleet personnel divisions: Command, Engineering, Medical, Security, and Science.  This does not mean you cannot \"double-up\" with your personnel.  You can have two command officers, a science officer, and a security officer, for example, on your away team, if the skill requirements for that mission are met as you assemble your team.  Each character has different skills and inventory items that will enable you to complete your missions.\nGame play is reminiscent of chess, as you, with your third person perspective, must maneuver your four man away team, step by step, through your scenario world.  There are tactical elements involved such as using the sniper rifle to take out a sentry from a distance or you can sneak up on an opponent and rendered him dead or unconscious by phaser, hypospray, or even the Vulcan nerve pinch.  However, this brings up two flaws to the game.  Firstly, since subterfuge is vital to most missions, players must maneuver their away team to avoid detection by automated security posts or guards.  This can make missions very long.  In some cases I took over two and a half hours to complete one mission.  Secondly, because you can move team members either one at a time or en masse, managing your team and their reactions can be difficult, as the Artificial Intelligence engine of this game is seemingly limited.  For example, if one or any member of your team is attacked there will be no reaction unless you command that character, so you're sitting cursing at your team member as they let a Borg attempt to assimilate them.  While in other cases you click on a spot where you want your team to walk to - to avoid enemies and they walk right into them, forcing you to start your mission over, as you were supposed to remain undetected for the course of the mission.\nFan's of first person shooters were probably overjoyed when Star Trek: Elite Force came out and might hope that Away Team would bring more of that action to life, but unfortunately it does not.  I hate to sound blasphemous against the Holy Franchise, but save your money for Dominion Wars.\nThe Pros:  Interesting storyline  Voiceovers by Brent Spiner and Michael Dorn  Decent graphics\nThe Cons:  Linear mission progression  Action repetitive  Mission time can be extensive  Only two exciting cut scenes - the opening and closing  Poor AI", "label": 2}

The graphics are way below par and the interaction is mostly Myst like.

{"text": "I have purchased and used several different home/landscape design programs.  I've used the Punch programs though quite a bit more than the others.  The main reason is that I like the graphics.  I think too that, for the most part, there is an excellent variety house and landscape options (wall types, colors, plants, etc).\nEven so, when I first used this program, I quickly became totally frustrated and confused.  That was partly because I generally start using programs without reading directions first.  With Punch, I had to force myself to sit down with the book and go through it step by step.  After that, I was able to design a house and yard from scratch, and even do the 3-D rendering.  Unfortunately, there were some things about the final product that I couldn't get quite right.  The roof was very tricky to figure out, and I was unable to get the walls to match up as they should.  The tools for the roof and walls look simple, but getting them to render appropriately isn't easy.  It would be nice if the program did this automatically.\nActually, I did have a lot of fun with the landscape function.  That part was very easy to use.  I made a path through an elaborate garden I'd created from a vast array of plant choices.  I wanted to also construct different kinds of decks and gazebos, put in fountains and playgrounds, etc, but these options were extremely limited.\nIf I could suggest some other improvements, it would be to have a wide variety of home plans available in the program and/or website.  I think there are maybe a dozen in the program now, and they're extremely basic.  Mostly all they do is give you a starting point.  I'd spend a lot more time with this program if there were some houses (such as the one in the picture) already done for you.  It's much easier to make changes to an already existing plan, than to draft one from scratch.  Another thing I'd strongly suggest adding is a good tutorial.", "label": 2}

After that, the novelty wears off pretty fast and frustration sets in at the fact that there are too few options in terms of brushes, colors, and lack of the all important \"undo\" button.

{"text": "I get basically access to every major OS through my school.  I first upgraded to XP Professional from Windows 98 and other than the silly general interface which I quickly changed, was very happy with it.  My first irritation came from the way it listed internet explorer on the task bar, open up more than three IE windows and it cascades them into one, if there was a way to change that setting I could not find it. That was really only a minor irritation.\nThe only problem I had with my applications was that I could not find a driver for my DVD decoder on my graphics card.  So I lost the ability of DVD playback on my PC, no big deal as I rarely used that anyway of late.\nThen the big problem came one day.  All of my desktop icons, became scrambled one day.  I was able to switch about half of them back to the correct icon, but the other half were stuck.  Restarting had no effect on getting the correct desktop icons.\nNot soon after the desktop icon problem I started getting considerable lag on the computer, which is a AMD 1gig machine with 384 Mb of RAM.\nThe only other problem was created with the horrible ISP I am forced to work with.  I can connect to the internet fine on my main machine and have it networked with another machine also running XP on a clean install.  The two computers comunicate well in all facets except for the internet.  Clicking on internet explorer on the second machine will cause the ISP on the first to dial up, and it will connect yet it shows disconnected on both machines interface.  Maybe a minor inconvience except that it has to many set up wizards for the network that don't give me the control to make the nessary adjustments that I am familiar with on earlier versions like NT or 9x. I'm sure it could be resolved but I am just too unfamiliar with  XP to know how to get around those setup wizards.\nThe only other major problem I encountered is that I have a gaming system and most of my games are very happy with the Fat32 file system, on the clean version of XP, you have to go to extensive searches looking for updated drivers.\nIn the end I switched back to Windows 98, I don't mind the occaisional restart.

It caught couple of viruses in the first couple of weeks.  It was also updating it's virus definitions regularly (auto). then a while later I noticed that the Homepage on my browser had changed, as well as my computer being a bit off. So I did an online virus check with Symantec (Norton) and it found 3 viruses on my system.  I wrote there locations down and then did a manual virus update to my ZA and asked it to check the specific folders where the viruses were found.  Zone alarm came back with nothing, it did not detect them. So I turned ZA antivirus off, and installed my old but still great Norton Anti Virus 2002 ( I like this one because it uses less resources than the 2005 version). Updated the definitions and scanned. It came up with 9 . YES 9 infected files (3 unique viruses). and from then on, I opted on keeping Norton on the side of ZA (which I now had the anti virus option off)\n\n2- Sometimes the installation will not go as smoothly as it should.  Yet this is easily corrected by uninstalling and re-installing.\n\n3- the junk e-mail monitoring of ZA for outlook sometimes goes off with no prior warning (the zone alarm buttons on outlook will disappear).  I have not yet discovered why this happened (only once for me). I re-installed ZA and now it has been working for the past month.\n\n4- The privacy controls (cookie monitoring and Ad blocking) are not very easy to tune.  What I mean by that is that when you activate  these controls, you will in many times be not allowed on certain websites.  I guess I just did not have the patience to tune them yet.\n\n5- Does not work with all pop mail programs. I know that It does work with outlook and outlook express, but as for others please check carefully.\n\nSummery:\n\nIn MY opinion this is a great product. Yet I give it 3 stars mainly because of it's lousy virus protection and some insatiability with it's web filtering (junk mail blocking). Yet I still think this is one if not THE best all in one security available at the moment. It uses much less resources than any of the TOP internet securities, and it is far more stable.  I also like that it DOES NOT conflict with other virus protection (Norton 2002 in my case) IF you opt to turn it's virus protection off.  Actually it keeps an eye on your other program's virus definitions and alerts you if they are outdated.  At the price that Amazon is selling this product at (rebate of $30) I would give it 4 stars.\n\nLayth", "label": 2}

{"text": "With Microsoft Office going for anywhere between $130-$300 (depending on what apps are included, there's the Education edition, Basic, Small Business, Professional, etc.) WORKS fills a gap Office shouldn't, and that's probably why Microsoft still releases it. I've used WORKS since it ran in DOS and was small enough to be run from a floppy, and it continues to be what it was, a function, if no-frills productivity suite. For most users, this will be enough to create most of the everyday letters and databases. You don't even have to bother with that annoying paper clip...\n\nIf you're looking for something more functional, but don't have the money for Office, then the open source Open Office would be the way to go. If Works comes packaged with your PC though, it might just be enough for you.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As a hobby, I design a lot of houses. I have been using 3D Home Architect 3.0 and wanted to try Professional Home design to step up. I'm not impressed.\nWhat the program offers: 1)complete integration and compatibility of program functions, 2) 3D rendered walkthroughs, 3) the ability to build custom furniture models, 4) the ability to build a physical scale model of the design\nThose are really neat sounding features, but they do not make up for the software's faults.\nFor one, the floor plan design tools are somewhat counter-intuitive. I found that I couldn't break a wall in two, and the auto dimensions were not helpful in determining the locations of any interior walls. It is impossible to copy and paste doors and windows. Unlike 3D Home Architect, most objects do not recognize when they are against a wall.\nParticularly annoying was kitchen design. This thing behaves more like modified rendering software than a home designer. When you start placing cabinets, the selection looks neat already rendered, but I could not tell if they had doors or drawers! The selection of cabinets that I could identify was woefully inadequate, and when placed the sizes were a little off.\nAfter trying to design a kitchen I didn't even try the other features. If home design software can't get a kitchen right it's otherwise useless!\nSo I say if you want to build a model of your house, get the cheaper 3D Home Architect 3.0, print out a floorplan, and get a modeling kit. Believe me, you'll still save time over using Professional Home Design.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.", "label": 1}

{"text": "At first blush, this is a nice package of add-ons for XP, and indeed there are some solid aspects to the product.\nFor the media player there are a few new skins and a couple cool visualizations. There is also a nifty voice control add-on that is fun but not 100 percent accurate.\nThere are four new desktop themes: Da Vinci, nature, space and underwater. There are eight new screensavers, the coolest of which is the aquarium, which looks nothing short of incredible. The others are so-so to pretty good.\nThere are three new games, Hyperbowl which is a good substitute for solitare, Labyrinth, and Russian Square which is a decent Tetris spin-off.\nThe problem is that in many cases, you are actually getting what amounts to a preview version of these features. For instance, the aquarium screen saver says you can find more fish online, but when you click the link, you find out you have to pay $20 for an upgrade that includes 20 fish rather than the three it comes with.\nAnd the Hyperbowl, which shows off six different lanes like bowling in ancient Rome or on the deck of a ship, actually lets you play only two of them. To unlock the others you need to pay... you guessed it, $20 for an upgrade.\nFinally, the hardware requirements are tougher than what XP itself requires. This is odd, since the product is sold as an extension of XP. But when I first installed it on a 450-Mhz Dell with 224Mb RAM and a 64M Voodoo graphics card, the new screensavers wouldn't work because Plus! didn't support the Voodoo card (Voodoo's maker, 3dfx, went out of business recently). Fortunately there was an XP update available on Oct. 25 that included better 3dfx support so it all works fine.\nSo in short there are some decent features and some definite product, but in my mind for $40 you should be getting the full versions of everything they put in there, or at least offered MUCH cheaper upgrades, like $5.", "label": 2}

Make absolutely sure this text appears under the price: \"Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\" If you buy from any other supplier, you are taking a chance what you get will be bogus and not usable, and possibly not returnable.\n\nORIGINAL POST\nAbout the subscription: 5 Stars. You buy the keycard, enter the code in the right spot, and BOOM your Office 365 membership is extended by a year (if you're renewing). Plus, you save about $15 (for the personal version) over what Microsoft charges if you go through them. How do you pass up $15 off???\n\nAbout Office 365:\nFirst, 1TB of cloud storage for a year is a good value all on its own. Dropbox will set you back $99 for the same thing. Google Drive, $100. There are OneDrive apps for every mobile device, so you can take your files with you. For cloud storage alone, it's a no-brainer. So even if you HATE Microsoft Office, OneDrive is good.\nSecond, you get the latest version of Office (currently 2016 on PC). Oh, when Microsoft upgrades Office, you get the upgrade too. No extra costs. This isn't just a bunch of web apps you can't use if you're off the grid, either (ie: Google, Apple). You get the full install on your PC or Mac. You also get one tablet and one phone (Android or iOS), and the apps are actually pretty good on those platforms. Oh, you also get the webapps which, IMHO, are better than the Google or Apple counterparts. Same familiar interface as the desktop/laptop applications, which is nice.\n\nIf you need more than one license, there is the Home version.

The two compliment each other very well, and could help any business get off to a good start.\n\nThis collection of forms and books covers the field of business information pretty well, from LLCs to corporations. In the past when I've needed business forms I've spent time searching the Web to find something I could adapt to my use. Now when I open this program I can usually find what I want in a couple of minutes. It's a great time saver.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone running (or starting) a small to medium sized business. You can spend a lot of time surfing for information. Or you can spend the $35.45 (price as of this writing) and have what you need at your fingertips. My opinion, this is a no-brainer decision. Buy the product.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I'm getting ready to have a house built and I wanted to do some planning for options, upgrades, and furniture placement.  I was looking for an inexpensive software package instead of having to draw the house with pencil and graph paper.  I ran across this as a cheap alternative to the more expensive \"CAD\" type programs.  \"You get what you pay for\" is very true in this case.  My first complaint is in the packaging of the product.  While the product tells you it can perform many functions, it really doesn't inform the buyer of the extent of it's functionality.  I should have realized something was amiss when the comparison chart includes the stat that this product has 4 CD-ROMs while the others only have 1!  It claims you can start a room from scratch, but don't even try starting with a 2D floor plan.  If you don't have a photo, this program is pretty much a boat anchor.  I decided to try and model a room first.  The installer program installs the first disk and then runs the program.  There are no follow on links to install the rest of the CDs. After loading the first CD, I searched for the room design function and couldn't locate it.  Realizing it must be on CD#2, I tried to install it, but the autorun program for installing #2 crashed.  It installed fine using the start menu Run command. This program is very non-intuitive.  For instance, once you set a room size, there is no indication of where to go and change the room properties.  While searching for it, every time you click on an icon, a movie-tutorial starts up, which really doesn't seem to explain what you want to do, but what you are doing.  Even the help index brings up a movie.  No wonder it takes 4 CDs.  Most of learning this program seems to be mouseclick trial and error.  This program doesn't even have a mouseover explanation of what the icon does prior to clicking. I'll be returning this and spending a little bit of money on a better package.", "label": 0}

{"text": "If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \"Certified Associate,\" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from \"Adobe Certified Instructors\", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks.

At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need.

{"text": "The main programs I use are Iphoto and Itunes.  Since Itunes is free (and if you have an Ipod, you have no choice), I'll concern myself with Iphoto and not rate the other programs in the suite.  I have not upgraded to Ilife 08, nor do I have any plans to.\n\nAlthough Iphoto is not free, a lot of programs rely on it (such as ComicLife) so not using Iphoto is almost not a choice.\n\nFirst of all, if you have a substantial photo collection (mine is over 40,000 images), you need to have memory.  I found that Iphoto was very slow until I put 2gb into my Mac Mini (which is the most mine will take).  Now it's just a little slow.  Second, Iphoto is VERY picky about your photo collection.  Once you've \"imported\" your photos, Iphoto doesn't like you to touch them, except in Iphoto.  Although Iphoto allows you to keep originals outside the Iphoto library, this makes the library extremely fragile and prevents some features from working properly because Iphoto simply stores each photo as a symbolic link to the original.  When you \"export\" your photos to a CD, you get a CD full of useless symbolic links.  I keep my entire library on an external drive.  This keeps the library together, and everything works (and - I can back up the entire library).  There is no obvious provision for doing something to a photo outside of Iphoto (for example, if the \"photo\" is actually exported from a graphics program, or \"printed\" from a document).  Unlike Itunes (which is a master of background processing), Iphoto forces you to sit through tedious \"progress\" screens whenever you do anything time-consuming (which is most batch operations).  If you (for example) create a movie from a slideshow, you cannot do anything else in Iphoto except watch the progress bar.  Even duplicating a photo takes a little while.  Iphoto gives you albums, smart albums (albums based on some selection criteria), and folders (and folders of folders) to organize your photos, however it does not let you create an album in a folder (you have to create it and drag it into the folder) and does not provide the option of sorting albums within a folder (you get to do this manually - a real pain).  Although you can have more than one Iphoto library, you cannot have more than one open at once, or easily copy between them (there are external programs which do this, but these simply issue Iphoto commands, so you get to sit through the whole tedious process, and these sometimes lose information like album comments).\n\nOnce you get used to Iphoto's many quirks, it's a great program.  I've never been able to access all of my photos so easily.  The thumbnail views are resizable (so you can have tiny to quite large thumbnails, depending on what you are looking for) and the full screen view gives you some limited (but usually sufficient) editing options.  The slideshows (using the Ken Burns moving picture effect) are beautiful, and one can export these to Quicktime movies for making DVDs (this is a better choice than creating the slideshow in Idvd, unless you like tiny pictures).  One can also create books, calendars, order prints, and there are plug-ins for exporting to various photo sites (such as Picassa).  One can also create emails with photos (which is a great feature - it's the only way to create an editable document containing a set of photos sized for printing), export photos (in various sizes) and create very bare-bones web albums (without exporting to iweb).\n\nI'd give Iphoto more stars if it made organization easier (create album in folder, keep folder sorted, smart folders of albums), was less dependent on drag/drop (tedious with huge lists of albums), worked better with other graphics programs (having to duplicate a photo first to create a variant of it is a real pain, and not automatically refreshing thumbnails makes working with native Photoshop originals exported as JPGs a real pain), and was better at background tasks.\n\none note about the other programs in the suite..\nItunes - one of my favorites.  I'm running the latest and it keeps getting better (I gave Iphoto less stars, since I know that Apple knows how to do background tasks when they want to).\nIweb - this is NOT a general purpose web editor (like Dreamweaver or Frontpage), but an editor for a templated web site.  If you export all of you albums to Iweb, you will quickly get a rather awkward site.  It is not easy to create a site which looks any different from the somewhat gimmicky templates.\nidvd - take Quicktime movies and photos and create DVDs for playing in a DVD player.  Photo slide shows are rather primitive compared to what you can do in Iphoto.\nimovie - never used. I find the \"pro\" version of quicktime (with cut/paste features) much easier to use.\ngarageband - never used.\nObviously lacking in this suite is anything to do with creating documents which combine words and images. I guess you need to buy Iwork (and get some more unneeded programs).", "label": 2}

Word Art has finally changed! In publisher 2000 you could actually do more with a standard text box than with the geriatric WordArt component. The new word art is nice for canned effects, but nothing to rave about.\nCUSTOMIZABLE TOOLBARS: What a novel idea. That the user should have control over what buttons belong on the toolbar. Word had it back in the days of Windows 3.11. How many years did it take Publisher to catch up? Unfortunately, when customizing the toolbar button hints are disabled. So if you do not know what the images mean you will be at a loss for what buttons are already on the toolbar.\nPublisher also has this new green sheen to it. Buttons shadow green when the cursor rolls over them (why? just why?). Push buttons now have a green depression which doesn't make them look selected so much as sick.

{"text": "This is an odd split of a review.  Norton SystemWorks combines several excellent programs, and Amazon offers the package at an attractive price (including rebates).  The problem is that one of the progams, Undelete, doesn't work well in Windows XP.  And that was the main reason I bought the package.\nBack in DOS-based OS days, Norton's Undelete was a lifesaver.  But in XP, Undelete essentially only works prospectively:  once you install it, it will undelete files you accidentally erase from that point on.  But for things you've deleted prior to installing Systemworks, you're out of luck. And if you do what I did - mistakenly erase photos on your SmartMedia card while it's still in your camera - you seem to be out of luck, too, regardless of when you install SystemWorks: that file is never under Undelete's protection in the first place and so can't be recovered.\nAfter doing some research I've found several other products designed to deal with this scenario - but why doesn't Norton? It seems that their transition to XP was rushed and incomplete - something understandable in the 2002 version, but less forgivable in the 2003.\nThat said, I'm glad to have the virus protection, the disk assessment, and the other tools, and through Amazon it's a fair price just for those.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.", "label": 2}

This to me is a brilliant innovation for Microsoft in that it expands their product base while removing the main reason why individuals used to pirate their productivity software: it was too darn expensive for a lot of people. Not anymore.\n\nI do recommend installing the inexpensive Ubitmenu UK add-in that brings back the old Office 2003 style menus to Word, Excel, etc. in case you prefer those, but the ribbon on the current iterations of Word and Excel is vastly improved over earlier versions (particularly 2007 and 2010).

It's obvious Microsoft, in this version, wants you to use IMAP, which does no more than show you a picture of what's already in your web based email accounts.  The argument is that IMAP allows you to check email from multiple devices, but with POP you can still leave email on the server by simply checking a box (Gmail, etc).

{"text": "First off, I am a computer geek so I didn't have much trouble getting around some issues that came up which were not covered in the manual. For me, the program is easy to use and seems to work fine for my needs - simply backing up my personal drive. I would not recommend any imaging software to the timid. You should have a basic knowledge of hard drive partitions before touching this type of software.\nHere's what I'm doing: I am backing up my primary 13GB IDE drive to my secondary 40GB IDE drive. All of my programs reside on my primary. The secondary drive is strictly for backups and media files (MP3, AVI, QuickTime, etc.)- nothing that needs to be backed up. I am running Windows 98.\nThe Ghost image files have a limit of 2GB. When a 2GB image file has been created (within my setup), Ghost will say that my drive is full and needs to continue on a new disk. There's still 13GB available on that partition (on my 40GB drive) so I know the drive isn't full. It doesn't say in the manual but just selecting OK is all that needs to be done to continue. At first, I thought this was an issue because I let Ghost create a PC-DOS boot disk. It happened with a Win98 boot disk so I finally studied the manual more closely and discovered the 2GB file limit.\nGhost is not able to make a bootable disk using a Win98 boot diskette. Ghost includes PC-DOS to make bootable disks for different needs such as CD-ROM support. Since I don't need my CD-ROM for this, I just made a Win98 boot disk and copied GHOSTPE to the floppy so I could have full FAT32 support - just in case.\nIn response to the reviewer who wanted the manual to have instructions for changing BIOS settings, that is not easy to do. Although there are a few primary BIOS manufacturers, PC manufacturers often customize the BIOS. There are multiple, possible ways simple settings could be changed on a PC. There is no real standard. This isn't for the Mac.\nOverall, I felt Ghost does what it claims it will. The manual is incomplete. More items need to be covered there. I had to figure out too much on my own. For Windows NT 4.0 users, nothing is said about the SID in the manual. I don't know if you'll need to search for additional software to create a unique SID for each Win NT PC. Ghost works well for my own personal needs, and I like it more than the backup software included with Windows.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I must say that my excitement upon seeing this product, and its pricetag, was such that my wife didn't even bother arguing with me when I told her that I must get this.\n\nAfter I have received it, well, I'm still happy that I own it, but it has been somewhat disappointing.\n\nInstead of rambling, I'll just write it in bullet form, disappointments first:\n1. As of Dec. 19, 2009, no HDD install\nIt's quite slow, and having it read from the DVD compounds this.  The only way around it is to copy them on your user-specific folder, which means that if you use a computer with more than one account, you'll need 50GBs of space per user if you want all of them to access it from the HDD.  The more tedious solution is to copy all the images on your harddrive and use a virtual DVD to load all the discs, but that is still awkward.\n\n2. Slow\nI can understand if the images are slow to load, or if the queries are slow due to the vast data, but I just don't understand why the geographic browser is slow on a computer that has more than one CPU.\n\n3. Picture quality\nI understand the reasoning behind loading not-so-great pictures in order to prevent some from using them outright, but the quality is hideous to somebody who enjoys photography.  It's nothing like something you'd expect in this decade - you can see jagged edges, jumps in tone, and everything else that screams that quality has been compromised for storage.  I would've been perfectly happy with pictures that they put on the web, resized so that it won't be usable outside of the computer, but the pics look as if they were scanned 10 years ago.\n\nWell, that's about it for disappointments, but #1 is a big big big disappointment since it's advertised as if it can be loaded to your HDD, and NG isn't the same if it doesn't have absolutely stunning pictures.\n\nAs for the often mentioned type size in articles, if you have a 24-inch monitor, it's not a problem at all.  On my 24 inch LCD, the articles are slightly larger than lifesize when viewed full screen, and it's perfectly readable without any magnification.  Pictures, on the other hand, are awkward - let's just say that the bonus DVD has better still shots than the scanned pictures inside.\n\nStill, it's nice to have 120 years worth of NG at your grasp, complete with ads and pictures, and able to search it for articles or even pictures, if you can remember at least part of its caption.", "label": 1}

I saw that it was available in a set on DVD ROM so I bought it hoping it would be an adequate replacement. While all the content is there, the Adobe Air interface is terrible and is an exercise in frustration to attempt to navigate it. The default page size is too small for me to read the text, so I have to magnify it, but every time you turn the page it resets and you have to magnify it again.\n\nAfter turning a few pages the program becomes non responsive and it just hourglasses for half a minute until it finally displays the next page. I tried it on my Macintosh as well and had the same results. Thinking it might be slow disk access causing the issue, I used the Mac's built in Disk Utility to create an .iso of one of the disks on my hard drive and mounted it as another drive. I still had the same slow and non-responsive behavior when it was running as a disk image on the hard drive as it did using the physical disk on both my PC and Mac.\n\nHaving over a century of content in this collection is great, but the Adobe Air interface to access it is horrible.

Installation was very easy and the newer version of Office uses much less hard drive space than the older 2003 version.  This was important since my installation was on a vintage PC upgraded to Windows 7.  The online instructions did not specify whether or not the old Office version needed to be uninstalled prior to installing Office 365, but I decided to uninstall 2003 first due to hard drive space.  The new Outlook picked up all my old message files automatically.  After the install I found a FAQ on the Microsoft support site indicating that Office 365 is designed to operate along side of any older versions of Office so it would not have been necessary to uninstall Office 2003.  However, I think it is cleaner and certainly more secure using only the newer 365 version.

I am disappointed in this product. There is value, but you will need to purchase other software or books to supplement as other reviewers have stated.\n\nHere are some of my issues, though there are others: No explantory text. You see 4 pictures and the voice says it in Italian and you must choose 1 of the 4 pictures. While this has some value, the lack of explantory text would be extremely helpful. I have no idea if I said \"The Boy is jumping\" or \"A boy is leaping\". While I get the idea he is jumping/leaping, it would be helpful to know what I am saying so if I ask something in Italian, I start the sentence structure out correctly. The other negative is how they use the word Bambino vs. Ragazzo vs. figlio. All three mean boy or male child. Specifically, Bambino can and does mean \"baby\" while figlio means \"son\". Rosetta Stone does a poor job of distinguishing this \"at\" times in their pictures. Thirdly, there were many pictures where you really can't identify if it is boy or girl (those of you who have gone through this one know what I am talking about).\n\nSo, while I think there is value, just know you need to have some supplements to your learning Italian.

{"text": "Till recently, words like \"Firewall\" and \"Hackers\" were limited to corporate networks. However, today firewall software for home computers has gained as much importance as the virus protection software and rightly so. With fast, always on internet connections and computers that don't need to be shut down every night, your home pc is an easy target for hackers looking for a host pc to run their web pages or applications, to steal informatin like credit card numbers and address or just to hone their skills. This is why you need the firewall. There is no question about it.\n\n The real question to ask is \"Do I need to spend close to 60 bucks to buy ZoneAlarm?\"\n The answer is NO.\n Firstly, if you are on Windows XP you already have basic firewall protection. Please look at your manual to see how to turn it on. For most users this is enough. If you are really interested in getting more protection, read on.\n If you have a router to share your internet connection with multiple home machines, then check the router manual. Many have firewall capability which is very powerfull and can protect you from most attacks. This firewall is as good as ZoneAlarm.\n If you don't have either, you will need something like ZA. But before you rush to order it, I would encourage you to try the free trial version available from [...] At this website, you will also find lot of other firewall programs for free.\n\n Finally if you still wanna buy ZA then you should be aware of following problems:\n1) If you have virus protection software like Norton or McAfee, ZA may actually mess your system up as all these softwares try to grab same files at startup time causing conflicts and system crashes. I had such a hard time that I had to uninstall ZA and clean up my entire system. The problem can be so bad that you may actually not be able to log into your machine at all.\n\n2) Poor customer service: ZA doesn't have good, knowledgable customer service. If you run into technical issues, don't expect quick, easy to follow directions to get out of the mess.\n\n That said, I still consider ZA to be a good alternative if you do not have Windows' built in firewall or router with firewall capability. However, do try the free version before you buy ZA Pro.", "label": 2}

WordPerfect the word processor has been a respected program for many years, but some of the features it presently supports are just ridiculous and absurd. WordPerfect 5.1 emulation mode is not very amusing, its not nostalgic either, just a plain waste of money. If you are someone who is yearning to use that mode of WordPerfect, get WordPerfect 5.1, don't waste your money to get limited, useless features that no one is using or getting any advantages from. The legal documents are always excellent for producing, documents that pertain that area. Quattro Pros features are still simple and no different from prior versions, the only feature that's enticing is the charts, and that's all for Quattro Folks. Presentations I always say is the killer app in the suite, the presentations are inviting, and sound effects are more catchy and powerful than PowerPoint, but not in the animation department. Corel Central features the same Outlook Express interface that is just not catchy and not worth switching to. Paradox is not easy and as integrated with other Database programmes such as Access. But Office 11 does feature satisfactory file compatibility with Microsoft Office and other Office suites such as Star Office and Open Office. For people who do not require much from their productivity applications WordPerfect Office is an excellent easy choice at an average price. For businesses who demand the most from their applications for connecting people, places, ideas and information, Microsoft Office 2003 seems more valuable and more flexible and more feature rich for the Enterprise because of all the tightly integrated applications that Microsoft Office 2003 compromises of. For small businesses WordPerfect Office only offers a portion of the incremental features users need. Microsoft Office 2003 on the other hand delivers with Outlook 2003 with such features as Business Contact Manager, which allows business to control their customer information more smoothly.

{"text": "Overall I am a fan of Norton security products.  The only shortcoming of the Norton Internet packages is that they do not always work well on all computer systems.  Particular challenges sometimes occur during the regular prompts for Live Updates.  On one computer the Update completed without a hitch.  I then completed an Update on another computer, with a separate Symantech Norton Internet Security subscription, and none of the security systems functioned.\n\nAdditionally, the updated Internet Security barred me from logging into the Internet.  A prompting window advised me to change the security settings, but that screen prohibited me from effecting alterations -- as I was not a \"Supervisor.\"\n\nI uninstalled and reinstalled the original disk twice with the same result.  After pouting for several days, and shopping around for a new Internet shield, I finally bought INTERNET SECURITY 2005 and gave it another try.  This time I had slightly better luck, but was on the computer several hours unbugging the system.  For starters, INTERNET SECURITY 2005 blocked all attempts to log onto the internet.  I had to disable the security program, defeating the purpose, to reach my Internet provider.  You would think that Norton INTERNET SECURITY would have the capability to debug itself, particularly when dealing with one of the top Internet services.\n\nI was about to give up when my Internet program intervened.  A window opened and advised me that my firewall settings prevented a connection.  I printed out a page of accompanying instructions.  The instructions took me through innumerouable steps and also directed me to copy several file names from the hard drive.  With fingers crossed, I restarted my computer and was able to access the Internet -- with INTERNET SECURITY enabled.

{"text": "People have been praising these programs for a while now and I can understand why, but I think an exception has to be made for the Hebrew version, and I'll explain.\n\nI purchased this back in January of this year to prepare for my up-coming trip to Israel in June.  I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.\n\nSo here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.\n\nTo be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.\n\nThe last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.\n\nEveryone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.", "label": 2}

{"text": "A Real Quicken Upgrade.......PLEASE!!!!!\n\n(3 stars - I like Quicken but last few upgrades are not moving us along)\n\nYear after year I grow more disappointed with the upgrades for Quicken. I am a long time user of Quicken and over the last 2-3 years have also started to use MS Money. I use Quicken to do the rock n roll accounting and Money for their great Life Planner and Budget features.\n\nOver the years I have suggested many improvements including multi-currency support (this is an interesting story of playing one against the other when Intuit was slow to respond I e-mailed the idea to the Money folks as well with cc to Intuit... I can't say that it was my mail that did it but the next versions had multi-currency support - Money still needs work in that area though). That story brings me to the central point - Intuit is loosing focus on what customers really need. The upgrades have become largely cosmetic and frankly a way for re-selling the same product to existing customers. Intuit has forgotten its roots in the simple customer needs that Scott Cook founded the company on.\n\nSavings and Expense Control NOT just Investing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLately I have found that while Quicken has done very well on the Investment Tracking features of the program the very critical area of saving and expense planning is sadly under studied.\n\nFrom my list of wanted product features written to Intuit over the years are things that will really help the end user like;\n\n1. An open user forum for the discussion of product improvement ideas so that the things customers really want get aired and hopefully done. Can anybody really talk to anyone at Intuit? They almost seem to practice keeping their distance and being aloof.\n\n2. A Shopping Planner\n\n  - All of us must shop (groceries, clothes etc) and it is in this area where users can plan to save on some expenses. A good shopping planner would allow for the easy creation of shopping lists, record item prices from different stores so was to prepare estimates of costs for shopping list and track price movements, identify stores that manage their prices better, track real consumer inflation for the good we really buy, etc.\n\n3. Utility Accounts (Electricity, Water, Gas, Phone etc)\n\n  - In paying for our utilities we need to track how much is consumed along with the expense (the KWH, Gallons, Minutes etc). Tracking and graphing utility bill items will help to keep the use mindful of consumption patterns and help identify places to save again. This new class of account should be added.\n\n  -(Yes, I already use the Quicken Home & Business and it does not have the capacity to capture units of items consumed in a bill. It can do it in an Invoice for items sold however which means that it is possible).\n\n4. Budgeting\n\n  - The only way to say it. The budgeting feature in Quicken is not as easy to use as the one in Money. Period. It needs a re-think!\n\n5. Life Planning (Retirement, College etc)\n\n  - Money just blows quicken away in this area! The differences are dramatic. The feature in Money is just about excellent though it could be improved in a few areas but Quicken's offering here is vastly inferior.  Fix the thing!\n\n  - The Life Planner should be multi-currency also. It does not support this now.\n\n  - (Hint: you can download the MS Money 60 day trial for free and see what it can do)\n\n6. Savings and Investment Accounts\n\n  - Quicken needs to be able to calculate expected interest income in Accounts based on cash balances, Interest rate, period and balances and to deduct taxes based and other charges on the interest income.\n\nThese are some of the ideas that would motivate me to go for Quicken 2006!", "label": 2}

Also, Intuit promised ma a free program for getting their credit card and charging a minimum amount of money.

It works well with the bank accounts, credit cards, and stock brokerage accounts I have tried. It nicely reminds me about capital gains implications of stock sales. Unlike Quicken 99, it allows me to modify scheduled transactions (to change to electronic payment instead of check numbers, for instance).\nThe bad.\nIts online stock price updates take a long time! I fixed that by stopping it from downloading stock prices on stocks I no longer own. Part of the reason it takes a long time is that it downloads news. There is no way to stop that. I think that is why it creates a huge file and it only allows backups on floppy disks. In my cases, that equals about 20 floppies! It claims to have a feature to automatically check online accounts and stock prices, but it doesn't work for me.

When I got a chance to request these videos, I thought I'd get a chance to learn Dreamweaver, finally, to maximize its capabilities. And I was totally blown away.\n\nThe videos are superb. The female voiceover is pleasant and very straightforward; there's no attempt at humor and no attempt to replicate a classroom course. The program uses live action sequences to walk us through specific examples, step by step. I was amazed at how many Dreamweaver features I haven't used, just because I didn't even notice they were there.\n\nI am not a web designer but I do know HTML and some CSS. If you don't, I'm not sure the opening video will be enough.

{"text": "I renewed my online subscription about ten months ago by buying it through Amazon.  Things went smoothly and everything was great.  I was getting access to the best newspaper on the planet relatively cheap with a three month archive.  Then Murdoch bought it and took control.  The website has been completely redesigned and the articles have been dumbed down a bit/shortened.  I get bombarded with several advertisements on the main page, even after paying $89.99 for a thirteen month subscrition.  Every article has at least two large advertisements on it that detract from the reading experience.  I used to be able to save the printer friendly versions of articles as web pages on my hard drive.  I don't bother anymore because they now look TERRIBLE.  The three month archive of complete newspapers arranged by date no longer exists.  I feel a little insulted because after dumbing down and shortening the articles, the WSJ now offers short video clip summaries certain articles.  I guess they provide this if you're too lazy to actually read the article.  The types of people who typically read the journal don't want their information spoon fed to them but that's what the new Murdoch WSJ does for you.  This newspaper is not what it once was.  If you liked the old WSJ, do yourself a favor.  Get a subscription to The Financial Times!", "label": 0}

It seems that with 90+% market share, the company could actually do something more remarkable than dress up their standard offering with pretty screens and potentially disruptive security features.  I understand that as a public company that serves a number of different markets, they have an obligation to their shareholders and to their customers.\nAnd well, they do their shareholders a great service with this product.  I'm just less sanguine about what they do for their customers.  Sure, by replacing the shaky code on which 95, 98, and Me are based, Microsoft has actually improved computing for the many users who must (and many of us MUST, thanks to the shrinking resources of IT departments, and the shrinking helpfulness of help desks) use Windows.\nThat said, if there's anyway you can avoid it, then try something a bit more elegant: the biggest improvements in operating systems still come thanks to open source projects based in Unix.

{"text": "When I read the other reviews on this product, I was a bit surprised at their very positive nature. Then I remembered how I felt when I first tried this program and it all made sense. My guess is that the folks who wrote the positive reviews probably haven't worked with the program for very long or tried to create anything but the most elementary structures. I know I was very impressed at first. That is until I tried to re-create my own home as the starting point for a remodeling project.\n\nThis program is very intuitive and easy to learn, the problem is that it is also very limited. After you get past the ease of creating floor plans, the next obvious progression is to see the building in 3D. That's where the problems begin. The roof planes are nearly impossible to control. If you are creating anything other than a simple cape or ranch, you will quickly see how un-nerving this program can be.\n\nSince most homes are comprised of several sections, controlling how the roof planes associated with those sections are generated is critical if you are to be able to create an end product that resembles what you had in mind. This program takes almost all of the roof plane control away from the user. The program generates the roof planes based on a few user defined parameters. This results in 3D images that almost never match what I had in mind.\n\nJust for the record, I'm not technologically impaired. I am an engineer by trade. If I can't get it to work, then the average user is likely going to have even more trouble. In the end, if you can't get an accurate 3D model from this program that resembles what you are trying to create, then why spend the money or the time on this program. Just get a $10 floor plan program or jump up to the $500 version of this Chief Architect program which, as I've been told (haven't used it myself) , is very capable.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Out of the box, this game is very buggy, and I recommend finding and downloading the latest patch.  It made a big difference for me.\n\nOnce the patch is installed, the game follows the 2nd and 3rd edition board game rules, and offers a nice range of customizable rule-change options.  The big problem is that the AI is very weak, even on the highest level.  If you play as the Axis, you'll find that Russia is passive, and Germany can storm eastward towards Moscow with very little resistance.  (Now and then there will be a counterattack, but never something so strong that Germany can't reclaim in the next turn what it lost.  And this is especially disappointing because the strategy tutorials emphasize that Russia has to be active and attack one of the three German border territories right in its first turn.  The AI does not follow its own advice.)\n\nAt any rate, once Germany seizes Moscow, the game is effectively over.  Russia will do NOTHING once its capital is lost, allowing Germany to bide its time picking off Russian territories one by one, and then mustering its troops to polish off the remaining troops (usually in Karelia) when the coast is clear.  By this point, Germany's economy should be at least 50 IPC's.\n\nIf you play as the Allies, you'll find that GERMANY is too passive, and Russia should seize Berlin before too long--again effectively ending the game, since Japan cannot survive alone against the three Allies.  I'm not exaggerating.  A skilled board player will easily wipe out the computer on the highest AI setting.  That means you'll get tired of this game quickly.\n\nOne other complaint: The soundtrack is downright embarrassing (unless you enjoy cheesy renditions of God Save the King on a 1980's style synthesizer).  I know this game dates back to 1998, but Civilization had a much better soundtrack five years earlier than that.\n\nAnd finally: The cinematic sequences are annoying and sometimes cause the game to crash.  Turn them off.  Also, if the Axis wins, the game will play a film sequence showing happy Nazi officials and their Japanese allies smiling to cheering crowds and shaking hands with each other.  I think that's a little offensive.", "label": 2}

If you play this game, it is much more fun to have the walkthrough printed so you can follow along during the many impossible puzzles.  It is also the longest Nancy Drew game I played so far.  Her Interactive needs to understand the difference between being \"fun\" challenging and \"boring\" challenging as this game was at many times.  Not a waste of money but should have been much much better.", "label": 2}

If you want to go to Taiwan, you'll need the traditional characters. A simple switch at the beginning that allows you to choose between character types would be a big improvement.\n2) No pinyin. When learning words, it much easier to hear the pronounciation if you have pinyin.\n3) There is no way to adjust the word lists. There are 42 items on the \"food\" list and you have to learn them all before you can do well on the quizzes. I find it easier to learn a few (3-5) words at a time. If there were a checklist of words to include on a list it would be so much better.\n4) They claim that the quiz adjusts itself to ask words you have missed before but it sure doesn't seem that it works that way.\n5) \"Well Done\" (when you get everything right on a quiz) for some reason is in English--everything else is Chinese.

It's essentially a sensei-in-a-box. The format is like how I was taught--you learn the writing while learning grammar while learning culture, but in a fluid, logical way. Short of taking a class or getting a tutor, this is the best way to learn Japanese. I even suggest it to those in beginning Japanese classes. It is an excellent supplement.\n\nThe writing style is genuine and interesting, and it almost feels like the conversation of a close friend. It compels one to read further and takes away any sense of learning as a chore.\n\nRosetta Stone is a poor excuse for a language-learning program. It's essentially a vocabulary building program with no actual thought to teaching the workings of a language. Not to mention that the aesthetics of this program are FAR superior than Rosetta, despite Rosetta's hefty price tag.

{"text": "I've had the pleasure of developing and maintaining a new database in Access 2003 over the past 6 months. The previous 3 years before that I had developed in Access 97 and migrated to Access XP. So, what are my impressions of 2003?\n\nOverall, 2003 is the same great product that XP was with minimal additional features and some new annoying ones. Here is everything from the help file under the \"what's new\" section for your viewing pleasure:\n\n* View information on object dependencies\n\n* Error checking in forms and reports\n\n* Propagating field properties\n\n* Smart tags\n\n* Back up a database or project\n\n* Windows XP theme support\n\n* Improved sorting in controls\n\n* Autocorrect options\n\n* Enhanced font capabilities in SQL views\n\n* Context-based Help in SQL view\n\n* Importing, exporting, and linking\n\n* XML support\n\n* Security enhancements\n\nMore new features...\n\n  * New look for Office\n\n  * Tablet PC support\n\n  * Microsoft Office Online\n\n  * Improving quality for the customer (This is a system tray icon that flashes a tool tip asking for feedback much like beta test software)\n\nFrom this list, the only notable development improvement is the improved XML support, but unless this support is critical to your application development, I would stay far away from this version and stick with XP (which I rate as 5 stars).\n\nI haven't found any improvements to the Visual Basic editor. There are a few new objects you can reference in VBA: dependency collections, smart tag collections, auto-correct, and sub form objects. Form design is mostly unchanged with no new controls to add to forms. They did improve the design interface with smart tags which helps messing around with controls a little. Propagating field properties sounds nice, but has limited use since it only propagates from table design view to all controls that are bound to it. That sounds dangerous. Are you sure you want to push that button not knowing exactly everything it will change?\n\nThe feature that I absolutely abhor in 2003 is the security enhancement. Unless you buy a digital certificate from an online authority like Verisign, the end user will be presented with THREE security warnings every time they open the database. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is a small utility that you can run to create a temporary \"development\" signature, but this only adds to the user confusion as installing this certificate on their machines will only present them with another security warning. Optionally, you can install a jet service pack and set each user's install to run in \"sandbox\" mode, but then you are limited in the code you can run on their machines which removes the entire purpose of running Access in the first place.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Overall the Rosetta Stone language program is very good.  Arguably it is the best that's out there.  You can read the other reviews and get a feel for the features of the program; You can also visit their website.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nYou will pay a lot of money for this program, this is what you get:  1) An install/application disc which is the base program.  This disc is the same disc that will come in all the Rosetta Stone programs.  They are interchangeable.  2) You will get one CD that holds all the data for Russian One and Two.  3)  You will get two workbooks, one for level I and the second for level II.  Basically these workborks are a verbatum index of what is presented on the software.  I would be surprised if you use them, in fact you can get better workbooks from your local bookstore for less than $15.  Summary:  You are getting one CD of data and two cheap workbooks for $300.  THAT IS IT!\n\nFinally, as the Fairfield lawyer explained to me, if you are not an authorized dealer, do not try to resell their software espicially on Ebay.  If you don't like the software after you purchase the software, give it away or throw it away but don't sell it on Ebay. To do so would violate Fairfield's copyright.

Quicken downloads your accounts much quicker then Money does. I have a big problem with Quicken. I cannot download a QIF file. Since my main credit card is in a QIF file i cannot track that. So, for me, that alone is a deal breaker and MS Money will work with that credit card company.

And really it works on paper.\n\nWith this update, you can also now rotate the old pages of the magazine like on a PDF software, which was not possible when the product was released.\n\nThanks NGS for these technical improvements, even if it took one year of complaint before they were achieved !\n\nNow everybody can buy the CNG safely for reading and printing.\n\nThis evening (13th of June 2011), I could at last buy and download the 2009 and 2010 complete updates, which were not previously available for customers outside USA and Canada. So thanks again NGS for solving this problem.\nI now have the complete 1888-2010 years installed on the hard drive of my computer.\n\nNevertheless, when I compare, the paper edition is more glamorous than the computer one, but it takes a lot of space to keep it in my small flat in Paris ( I own all the July 1946 until May 2011 paper issues of the NGM).", "label": 1}

{"text": "I really wanted to learn Spanish for more than just vacations, but more to communicate and better myself. Indeed, knowing Spanish is getting more and more important right now.\n\nI wanted to learn on my own and did a lot of research to find the best Spanish learning tool available, tried several demos of different products, asked to various teachers...I even had Spanish speaking people try out the demos with me so I can have a feedback of what would be most effective!\n\nAt first, I was interested in audio CDs (Pimsleur,...) so I could learn in my car, or at home, fast and on the go, but I realized after trying that it will help me with my vocabulary maybe but I will never be able to get an intermediate level with audio CDs. Then, I looked for software, as it probably has the most potential for self-learning. I visited several websites with reviews like about.com, toptenreviews.com. I tried and was mailed different demos and really fell that TeLL me More was the best product for me, it has so many activities, and the speech recognition was really what I was looking as being able to speak was important. I could not see myself reach a high level with Rosetta Stone, as it was very basic and repetitive and seems to only consist of pictures over and over again. Other software seemed really inferior.\nThis new Premium version is great as it has all the levels in the same package so I did not need to worry about buying several packages, or even a headset and microphone as it includes one. It also has an audio CD, which was a nice bonus. I already went through the Complete Beginner and was really amazed by the number of activities available: picture word association, crossword puzzles, videos, pronunciation,...Also, the speech activities really helped me with my pronunication, which was terrible at first! I really enjoyed the Grammar too as I could not find another software with grammar. I plan on buying another TeLL me More software to try to learn French next time.", "label": 1}

The program is intuitive and will guide you through all the steps for the correct legal form.\n\nThe program has drop down menus of different categories and you choose the appropriate form.\n\nClick once on the form and it will give you a description of what the form is for. You are able to view examples of the document as well. Double-click on the form and it will provide a more in-depth description of the form and what information is needed before you begin.\n\nThe program is very user-friendly and guides you through all of the necessary fill-in-the-blanks. On the left of your screen is a pane that explains each section you are filling in.\n\nWhen you are done, you can view, edit and print.\n\nThe program has a section that is in PDF format that offers helpful hints and guides to running and starting a business to legalities and contracts for the business.\n\nThere is even an online section that is offered by Nolo that gives more information such as ways to find a business lawyer and an online legal dictionary.\n\nThis program is perfect for the beginner or a seasoned entrepreneur.

{"text": "I own several different versions of Britannica software and although Wikipedia is more informative, I continue buying it to help with development costs. However, I do believe that certain aspects need to be improved to make this product better - or it will disappear despite of its long and proud history:\n\n1. Their pricing policy is very inflexible. I bought v2010 for about $40 and while I was still waiting for the item to arrive, they released the new v2011 and made me a \"special discount\" offer (one intended for loyal customers) for the unbelievably low price of... $40. This kind of attitude does not make me feel \"valued\". If you know that you will be releasing your new version soon, either offer it for free to people who bought it recently, or sell it at a seriously discounted price.\n\n2. Try looking for the same information in Britannica and in Wikipedia, and you will find out that the information in Britannica is - by comparison - quite limited, there aren't enough pictures, links, etc. Biography articles often do not include a picture of the person for example. Other articles include videos, but they are outdated and strange. I live in Varna, Bulgaria - a beautiful city on the Black Sea coast - and Britannica has always included video information on it which is probably 20 years old, taken from a strange location and containing factual and misleading information. One may argue that a single DVD disk cannot contain current video footage on all geographical locations but in the era of Google Earth what Britannica has to offer is sometimes beyond inefficient.\n\n3. It seems that Britannica editors take quite some time to include information on a renowned person in it. Type in \"Tarantino\" and you get an article on... \"tarantella\" - \"a couple folk dance of Italy\". I wonder what should one achieve to be finally included in Britannica's \"Ultimate Reference Suite\"? Google search has the answers that Britannica does not - and it is free.\n\n4. A postal card for registering the software - by mail! - is included with your purchase. Britannica views itself as an 18th c. product that just happens to be on a DVD.\n\n5. When you buy the DVD they cannot issue you an invoice. Here is what they wrote to me: \"We do not issue invoices as the order system that you have used is for consumer sales only. It is not for use by companies. There are a couple of problems here. The first is that the software that you have purchased is only sold with a single user license and so we do not allow the purchase of this by a company as a company is not an individual. The second problem is that we do not issue invoices for these orders. Only the receipt that you should have received already.\" OK, I used their site to buy their software, they allowed me to enter my company's name in the corresponding field, and then, all of a sudden, I cannot get an invoice. The argument about the licensing issue is just laughable - I own about 40 software titles and all have been bought with invoices, it is only Britannica sales that feel special in this respect. I said, I am buying Britannica out of the goodness of my heart, and all I ask for in return is that the invoice is issued in my company's name so as to claim back $4 in taxes - but, no, they will not do it. That is very regrettable. It is also bad customer service.\n\n6. Speaking of bad customer service, they never sign their emails to customers. I am signing my name, and the person (or people) I am communicating with are always faceless, have no names and remain hidden behind the neutral phrase \"Britannica Customer Service\". Have good business practices never reached Britannica?\n\n7. This is a major drawback: Britannica does not download any updates to your HDD. They are made available through a special tab, but they are separate from what you have initially bought and Britannica likes to keep it that way. This is very inconvenient. The updates cannot be searched through the normal encyclopaedia search, so they are not truly accessible, unless you would like to search two times for every item.\n\nI like running the software (although it takes a fairly long time to start), going through the different options, reading the articles. But I like all software and using dictionaries is what I do for living. If you are OK with the shortcomings listed above, I can recommend buying Britannica.", "label": 2}

With all the features it is quite a bulky Bible...\n\nI just purchased the Kindle E-book version and it is awesome.  I am primarily using it on a Kindle paperwhite and have also tried it on a 7\" tablet with the Android Kindle App.  Each verse that has a study note is identified by the verse number being an underlined link.  Study notes are easily accessed by selecting the link, then you get back to the verse through another link on the notes page.  Maps are clearly readable on the paperwhite and can be enlarged by pressing and holding on the map, then selecting the magnifying glass that pops up.  These look awesome on the 7\" tablet's color screen.  Love being able to adjust the font size too.\n\nNavigating between books is fairly easy on the Kindle Paperwhite and the tablet.

After reading what seemed like good reviews by well respected publications such as PC World & PC Magazine about this product and it's  anti-hacker technology I decided to give this much talked about firewall a  try for myself.  Well, too bad for me because at the time that I purchased  this product it was ONLY available at the company website and ONLY  available as a download.

{"text": "Even though I did not have any of the problems other reviewers have had installing this product, Easy CD Creator 5 fails to deliver in some important areas.  Some of my frustrations:\nCrossfading between tracks is a big deal to me.  The print manual and online documentation says you can overlap tracks with no fade out of the first track or fade in of the second track.  However, when actually opening the option box to set a crossfade the \"no fade\" option is not there.  You are forced to fade one track or the other or both.  When you choose to fade out the first track and fade in the second you can set the overlap for as much overlap as you want.  However, when only fading out the first track or fading in the second track you are limited to only 4 seconds of overlap.  When you factor in the few seconds of built-in silence at the end of most CD tracks, the crossfade effect is essentially lost.  Another feature that was very important to me was the ability to \"normalize\" tracks compiled from various CDs so the volume level is consistent.  Inexplicably this feature is offered in the more basic \"SoundStream\" part of the Easy CD Creator suite, but not in the \"advanced\" MusicCD Project part.  As a result you cannot normalize tracks and perform crossfading, or other advanced editing work, from the same application.  (At least not easily.  Maybe there's a workaround, but why should it be so difficult?)  If you manage to customize transitions between tracks to your liking, you cannot save your work and come back to it later without losing all of your transition settings.  I gave the product two stars because I did have good success burning music discs when keeping things very simple and not trying to get to fancy, so it's not completely useless.  However, the free software that came with the CD-RW drive worked just as well as this product when doing a simple burn.  I'm very disappointed that Roxio is advertising features for this product that either are not there or do not work properly.  Especially for the price they are charging.

{"text": "The product description is simply in error.\n\nI'm running a Sony Vaio with a P4HT 2.8 GHz (1.5GB RAM, 2 DVD+-RWs, 280GB over 2 hdds) and this is a chip with TWO processors on board one chip. XP Home has handled it as a dual-processor machine with no problems.\n\nNaturally, this makes for blazing speed, far faster than any other equivalent chip on the market.  TaskMgr displays activity graphs for both processors.  (It is also a RISC chip for those of you to whom this means something.  Something new for Intel, long wedded to the CISC architecture, but the PPC chip's smoking use of RISC gave it too much of speed advantage)\n\nI'm buying this full version because I'm tired of that horrid \"Reinstall Disk\" kit that came with the Sony Vaio.  It's never worked right and every time I've reinstalled with it, I have new problems.  And the reinstalls are becoming more frequent.  It also doesn't handle the SP2 upgrade well.  So, tomorrow, I will gladly reload again.  Besides, of the dozens of apps Sony included, I use none of them.\n\nThis should, finally, solve the \"Reinstall Kit\" blues.  Those of you old enough will remember when things were different.  First PC in 1986: came with a full set of IBM-DOS diskettes.  Second PC 1997: came with fully functional copy of 95B with \"USB support\" (problem being no computer had USB ports in those days!).\n\nThen Microsoft went to this stupid \"reinstall kit\" garbage.  Anyone considering buying a new computer, pony up the extra $179 or $269 for a full version of XP (Home or Pro depending upon need).  I have no need to be part of a LAN, so the extra C note for Pro would be vanity.\n\nAll in all, the best OS MSFT had built yet.  The first three years I ran it, I had a total of three crashes.  This last year's been a nightmare, esp with the SP2 upgrade.\n\nStart fresh tomorrow.\n\nOverall, I give a three star (really 3 1/2 stars but you can't do that) rating to the product.  In terms of ease of use, stability and robustness, MSFT has come a long way.  And since both are UNIX, Apple really no longer had any substantial advantages over XP.  It's really come down to a choice; almost a clan thing--the way people used to about Fords and GMs (notice how there was no AMC clan?) when I was a kid in the 70s.  If you're of a certain age and I say, \"I was raised GM\" you instantly know what I mean.  Despite using the Mac a lot over the years, I was firmly \"raised\" DOS/Windows.\n\nDespite that, the room for improvement is obvious.  If a firewall's included, why, for instance, isn't a virusscanner?  A spyware/adware scanner?  That would be a way to add real value to the OS product.\n\nProtected memory is much better, but still wildly uneven in its ability to save a hanging app from hanging the machine. Explorer.exe rarely recovers fully and almost always requires a system reboot if it cronks. System Restore is also hugely improved over the shaky start with ME.  If you can get to safe mode or your desktop, you can usually count on SysRestore to fix your problem.\n\nFinally a glaring lack is that of a data shredder and encryptor.  In this age of identity theft and constantly hacking (over 12,000 attempts last year alone on my little machine!  Hundreds of \"serious\" attacks included!).  A shredder is absolutely needed as is an encryption function.  Given the platform dominance, the encryption should be able to be integrated seamlessly into the shell.  Without a shredder, someone with almost no computer knowledge, can easily search the \"deleted\" files on you hard drive and recover credit card numbers, tax returns, banking passwords, etc.  Someone more technically sophisticated, could do this from across the planet.\n\nOh well, it'll never be perfect.  Just remember, every time your XP crashes or hangs, that's a dollar Redmond did NOT spend on Quality Control.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I got Easy CD Creator 5 (last November) to install on my new Win XP computer, because Easy CD Creator 4 won't work there.  Well, neither does Easy CD Creator 5!  I followed every step Roxio provided and downloaded their Win XP upgrade.  I've done this five times!  I just tried again today after having to completely reinstall Win XP and all my software, because the Easy CD Creator 5 install made my CD unuseable even by Windows XP standard CD writing program.  And Roxio's support has been absolutely lousy.  They gave me both an 866 and toll number to call.  But the 866 line just told me all circuits were busy and the toll number told me their support is only open 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.  I tried to install it again anyway and, yup!  My CD is unuseable for writing anymore and I can't even get back to the restore point I created!  I'm not sure what Roxio's install is doing, but no software should be so difficult and dangerous to install that a two page instruction sheet has to be followed to  delete files and directories (including InstallShield!) and edit the registry to delete keys.\nOh, I installed it on my Win98 PC to see if it worked there OK.  It seemed to, but I found out it wouldn't read any of the CDs I had created with V4 as DirectCD disks.  In fact, it made them unreadable even after I restored V4.  Roxio told me that is a known problem and they are working on it!  But they wouldn't tell me when it would be fixed or how I would know if it ever was!\nIf you want all the details, email me and I'll send you the complete list of emails I've received from them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've been designing with DW for a while now. The 2004 upgrade remains essentially the same, except for a few changes:\n[1] The default is now CSS. If you want a tables based layout, you can still work with it but a change needs to be made in the preferences.\n[2]  The previous Dreamweaver MX supported CSS-P to a degree but editing it wasn't always easy. MM were obviously aware of Dreamweaver's rendering problems and for the new version, have borrowed upon Opera's rendering engine to do some of the hard work and it's now several magnitudes better.\n[3] Secure FTP built in\n[4] Microsoft Word and Excel copy and paste. Earlier version would lose the formatting when text was pasted inside DW. In this sense, DW now equals Frontpage\n[5] On-the-fly cross-browser compatibility checking\n[6] Some simple image editing like cropping and tonal adjustments without leaving the program\nAll this is fine and dandy, some of these features are also a god-send, but the CSS handling is a bit quirky yet. Surely, there must be a simpler and more intuitive way to do all this? There's far too much jumping around the interface required. Instead of providing one really inspired WYSIWYG way to do things, it seems to offer a multiplicity of mediocre alternatives, almost as if the programmers couldn't make their minds up and say, 'Hell, we'll put it all in'. That is a recipe for camels, not thoroughbred racehorses.\nIf you know your way around Dreamweaver already, you might welcome the new CSS editing facilities but 50% of the full price for an upgrade seems grossly excessive. I'm a bit disappointed that after all this time, Macromedia have produced something that is okay, but not great.\nBesides, in the rush for an upgrade (now that GoLive is getting its own feet too) MM seems to have settled for some degree of bloat. My DW updated to 2004 MX is even more of a RAM hog than before.\nNet net: I'd wait for the next version upgrade, by when hopefully MM would have tied in all these loose ends.", "label": 2}

Also, the user interface is nice and intuitive.\nBut there are problems. First, telephone support is the worst in the industry. And I say this after having complained about many companies. I was on hold for two hours for a single phone call, and their telephone system hung me up both times without my reaching a support rep. I never got a chance to talk to a live person--so I demanded a refund, which I had to wait a long time to receive.\nApparently the product is not well tested on xp or win 2000.

{"text": "If you are after the NKJV version of the bible with study notes at a price that will not break the piggy bank, then this bible is a very good option.\n\nI have used the NIV life application bible(Hardcover) in the past and enjoyed it very much. I wanted to try the NKJV Life Application version and after some research about the options for kindle, I decided to try this one. This review will refer mostly to the transfer of the bible resources onto Kindle as opposed to a discussion of the quality of the study notes etc.\n\nUp Side\n\nThis bible has been very well formatted for kindle.\n\nStudy notes swap out to text and vice versa very well and things like searching for a verse is very quick if you know how to do it (Press Menu, go to Index, then type in verse you want using abbreviation. E.g. Mt 6 30 will take you to Matthew 6:30). This is the same as it would be for most other study bibles/commentaries I have tried like the ESV study bible or the Matthew Henry Commentary (Unabridged). It is so quick that I was able to use three different resources on my kindle to look at one passage of Scripture during my bible study without too much problem.\n\nThe harmony of the Gospels is also well thought out for Kindle. You do not view it in a table, but rather by events which you can scroll through with all relevant Scripture passages for each event listed under each heading.\n\nTo get to the Concordance, Personality Profiles, Maps, Charts, Study Notes or Cross References is not too crazy of a process. Press Menu, select Go To, select Table of Contents, scroll to the end of the contents and select your desired resource. This may seem a little involved but once you get used to it, it's actually quite quick. 5 seconds approximately.\n\nI have not viewed all the maps, but some of the maps I looked at in Genesis were clear and I could read the place names on the maps clearly. As with the study notes, you can move the cursor to the references for Scripture passages that refer to various places on the map. This is pretty useful and has worked seamlessly for me so far.\n\nWhen you are reading a passage in a particular book of the bible, you can use the left/right cursor button to look at the master index for the next book or the current book you are reading. This makes it a quick process to switch between chapters in a book. You don't have to be on the first page of a chapter to navigate to other chapters, you can be reading anywhere in a book to use this navigation tool. A definite plus!\n\nDown Side\nThe only thing I did not enjoy too much was the timeline. If you know the Life APplication Bible, there is a time line at the beginning listing major events in the bible and history. This was so small on the screen (Kindle Keyboard 6\") that I could not read the words.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Windows XP works quite well, it represents a considerable improvement in stability over Windows ME.  The new look is visually pleasing though a little childish looking.  However, it has two large drawbacks: the outrageous price and the restrictive license.\n...The price has been steadily rising for new versions of the windows operating system and this version continues the trend.  With profit margins of 95% or more (Ie they charge more than 20 times what it costs to make), you definitely should not buy this operating system at this price.\nThe second issue is the restrictive license that comes with the operating system.  Essentially Microsoft reserves the right to read your hard drives and change anything without warranty or limit, this has caused considerable damage to many peoples computers when the automatic update feature installed malfunctioning patches automatically disabling the computer.\nThe verdict: Don't buy it unless you really need it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "8.10 was a great stepping stone but there have been at least two updates since this version came out. I have used 9.04 and had many issues resolved. Now that 9.10 is out I think it may be the best OS I have used. And the best part is all Ubuntu OS are free online. There is no copy right violations or stealing in any way. There are numerous sites for support Linus/Ubuntu and if you can't find what you need just post a question and some geek will get back. I use the term \"Geek\" lovingly since these guys and gals really know their stuff, plus I am the proud father of a Geek, and are more than happy to help. Ubuntu itself has frequent updates and support. All the software that you may need or want is free and many of the products that other software vendors sell is free with Ubuntu. Few programmers ask for a donation but even those will run properly without shelling out money. I do believe in supporting those that work properly to encourage them to continue working on new projects.\nAnything that a MAC or Windows OS can do, Ubuntu can do also. The difference is price. Ubuntu is free! Plus if you're not afraid to get a little grease on your hands you can get under the hood and see what makes Linus tick. The problem is tearing yourself away from the free games suchas solitaire, suduka, free photo editing programs, cd/dvd programs (please note...I use the plural because there are so many), and Open Office for word processing, spread sheets and other productivity programs.\nNow the downside: If you can't borrow a copy from a friend, relative or library it may take a very long time to download. I say borrow because Ubuntu encourages everyone to give copies to friends. The biggest drawback in my opinion is that if are one that can not follow directions and read directions carefully then wait till your kids get home from school.\nIf you have an older machine this OS and any of the newer ones may not run correctly. My friend teaches grade school and has accumulated about two dozen donated computers, most using 98 or 98SE (Ver i386). All were DOA. After obtaining a copy of Edubuntu (6.06.1) she has resurrected these older machines and even has the USB ports working (which they did not work with MS older Operating Systems. Most of these older machines use the old floppy \"A\" drive and do not have CD readers/writers. For younger kids its great. You give them a computer that is inexpensive, you control what they have access to and you keep them offline so they aren't exposed to what kids should not be exposed to.\n\nIf you know how to use the old DOS or even Basic languages you can figure out most Linus base systems.

After you do that, there is a button to download the software.\n\nAt the start of the download you will have to enter your school information.  During the process of creating an account you have to enter an email address which it will then require you to verify via a link sent to that email.  I just used my school email address, but it did not seem like you had to use an email ending in .edu at that point, I just did to make it easier.

{"text": "I exercise racehorses and from time to time take a month or two off to recoop.  I bought this game because I missed the horses and wanted something to keep me occupied.\n\nConsidering the nature of most horse games in the past, this game has very good points and some not-so-good points.  I think the technical information about the horses has been an issue with most horse people writing a review.  The temperments are more of a \"pretend\" story than they are simulated.  If these horses were real, this is what they would be like.  But they are not real, they are digital recreations.\n\nThe chores are okay, except the order in which they are done boggles me.  You don't even groom your horse (let alone bathe) after you ride!  I was always taught to groom before and after you ride.  The mucking gets annoying because the door to the manure pile is really narrow and it's hard to position Annie with the wheelbarrow to get them back in the stable.\n\nI wish this game and the Let's Ride Championship Season could be combined.  In this other game, the tack was actually kept in a tack room, you could custom-mix your feed, you gave the horse water, you needed a halter to take the horse to the cross-ties, you got to brush off \"dirt\" from your horse, and you tacked up bit by bit.  However, the graphics of Championship Season were not the best, the jump course was lame, the dressage tests were laughable, and it didn't seem to matter whether you competed or not.  I think if you could somehow combine the good points between these two games, you would come up with a pretty cool horse game.\n\nBut overall, Legacy of Rosemond Hill is not terrible and I would recommend it to someone who likes horses and wants to enjoy a digital reality.  At least in this game you can't get thrown off or your horse run away with you!  That would be realistic!  One thing, I have not yet figured out how to get all 100 point thingies in the very last level before the championship.  Note to all the frustrated players out there: you cannot get first place in stadium jumping without getting the 100 points and all the check marks of stuff you need to do.  No matter how fast you jump the course, Melissa will always be faster if you do not.\n\nThe Competitions at Rosemond Hill I found very confusing and illogical.  The flags on the jumps are sometimes on the wrong side, it's difficult to navigate through the courses (the paths are not clearly marked) and there is nothing to gain even if you do.  You can't really design your own jump course, they give you a track and they let you pick out what jumps to put on it (I was hoping to design the landscape and the turns and jumps).\n\nSo, forgiving the technical fallicies, this game is pretty fun and may help if your having horse-withdrawal symptoms.", "label": 2}

{"text": "A long time unix fan, I found SuSE 10.1 to be a pleasant surprise. While the Novell Enterprise product, based on the SuSE 10.1 code base, is a bit more polished than SuSE 10.1, it's also more specialized, being divided into a desktop and a server edition. For my money, like SuSE 10.1 because it comes equipped with all the tools and features needed to serve either purpose quite nicely.\n\nLinux has long been a power in the server room, with unusual flexibility, long uptimes and good performance, but linux vendors such as Novell are finally beginning to bring the power of the open source community to the desktop, and it shows. The added polish and attention to detail are making it conceivable for non-experts to begin using a linux desktop for their everyday routine.\n\nAs has been pointed out, there are some problems with this release - the biggest problem is the update mechanism, which I would describe as broken. Novell is committed to getting it working well, but in the meantime, I find that smart is an excellent replacement for yast. Smart is based on the ideas of the apt package tool, and capably fills the job of installing software packages and keeping the system up to date.\n\nThe other problem I see is the consumption of system resources by the beagle search engine. Again, I am sure this will be sorted out over time, but for now, I find that it's better to remove or disable beagle. Doing so completely removes any pauses or freezes on the systems I've tested, and enables a silky smooth game of ut2004 or quake 3 arena over the internet.\n\nOne other issue is the app-armor service, which while a good idea, is perhaps a bit restrictive. While it can be adjusted, some may find it easier to simply turn the service off.\n\nWith those 3 items addressed, SuSE 10.1 is a very capable, pleasant and snappy OS, and would rate 5 stars. The fact that the couple of issues I mentioned must be dealt to get to that blissful state, are the reason I rate it only 4 stars.\n\nBottom line: For an experienced linux user, a great OS for desktop and/or server room. For less experienced users, I'd recommend something without the minor nits I mentioned, e.g. Linspire, Xandros, or the Novell SLED 10 product instead.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is my fifth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my third year using the state tax version. I'm sold on it. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.\nI'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. However, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. Still, you can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.\nI tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out.

I had been burning mostly audio CDs using the HP software that came bundled with my CDR drive with good success. I decided to buy a more full featured package to get more control over the burning process. Based on the strong reputation of Easy CD Creator's previous versions I purchased ECDC5 assuming it would be a great product. Not quite. First off the user interface is overly stylized to the point of being annoying. It attempts provide a useful front end to all the programs offered by the package but instead looks like a mess. Second there are inconsistancies between the programs, SoundStream uses a different method to preview audio tracks than Easy CD does which on my machine means one works and the other dosent. Third in an effort to be user friendly they have dumbed down the user interfaces for the programs significantly. Going into the options sections for Soundstream and Easy CD provides few options of value. Fourth, bugs. The discopy program would sit and try to access my empty CD drive for 20 seconds for some reason and then eject the tray regularily. Both Easy CD and SoundStream would fail to recognize a audio CD in my CD drive while other programs had no problem. Using disc at once and making a image file, the discopy program still made a audio CD copy with so many errors it was unbelievable. All and all, ECDC5 was disappointing enough that after one day I uninstalled it and returned to my retailer who was good enough to give me a refund for this turkey. On a happier note I have downloaded the full featured 30 day Nero demo ([...]) and have been using it with good results. My initial usage has shown Nero to be a small, robust, full featured program for burning audio and data CDs with a powerful user interface that accomodates both beginners and experts.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I thought I would upgrade my Office 2007 package to Office 365 Home since Office 2007 is at end of life. Big mistake.\n\nI downloaded Office 365 on a brand new computer from Dell. Went through all updates to Windows 10 to make sure I was at the latest and greatest release. Mapped network drives and verified I could access files on the NAS (Network Attached Server) I have on our home network. So far so good. This is when I installed Office 365; note that Office 2007 not yet installed on this machine. I have 3 other PCs, one of which is an old laptop (7 years) which this new pc is to replace. All of the others PCs are running Windows 10, Office 2007 and dta stored on the NAS working just fine.\n\nOffice 365 installs fine and I of course check for and install all Office updates. I am able to open files from the NAS but every time I do so I get the protected view warning that documents downloaded from the internet could be unsafe. Not wanting to have to click enable for that warning every time for the rest of my life for any file that I open from the NAS I went to make my NAS location a Trusted Location. But when I follow Microsoft's instructions on how to do that I get the \"cannot do this for security reasons error\". Sigh - Microsoft has now made it irritating and unnecessarily complex to use my home network. SO I look on the web and find this is not an uncommon problem but the homebrew solutions out there involve editing the registry or other equally arcane solutions involving trusting someone on the web's incantation to fix it - \"really it will, just trust me\".\n\nNext step - call Microsoft Tech support. I'll bet you can guess how that turned out. I quickly exhaust the minuscule competence of the first level support, but to be fair all I really expected was for them to be able to send me to someone who had competence beyond check the power cord and on button.  So I get a scheduled time for Tier 2 to call me back . Fair enough. I get a call from Tier 2 asking me what is the issue. So all the work I spent explaining the issue to the first help person was wasted. This would prove to be a recurring theme since I would have to start all over with each new person. So this expert asked to take remote control of my machine. OK. Then they turned off protected view entirely, which meant I would be eliminating security for the entire internet. Not what I needed. So took the time to step her through the process of Trusted Locations and explained I just wanted to trust my NAS, not the entire hacking community. She was able to see the error message, but had no idea how to troubleshoot this. Fair enough - I expected that she would pass me on to the next tier and to a technician  who specialized in the area. But  instead she asked to take a few minutes to confer with her team. OK - I appreciate someone who wants to figure things out and is willing to consult with teammates. A little while later she comes back and wants to try everything but this time as an administrator. Good idea but doesn't work. Then here is the stunner - she asked if I could call an IT person. I thought she meant a Microsoft help IT person at first, but no she meant did I have an IT person somewhere in the home. I then patiently explained that I was the person who set up my PCs and Home network and that It all worked just fine on the other machines. She basically said I am out of luck then.  What?!?!  SO I stated I would need to get a refund. That of course prompted her to say she would transfer me over to the commercial side, could I please hold while she transferred me. Now we're getting somewhere! Nope!  I talked with the commercial side operator, explain yet again the issue and she asks for my domain email account. I do not have one. She says they cannot help a home user. She gives me another phone number. I call it and give them my case number again and explain the issue again only to find out I am back at the basic help desk again. But the help desk person says the even though this is an issue found in Office, it is likely a Windows function causing the problem. He sends me on to the Windows tech support. After waiting on hold for 37 minutes and 17 seconds I finally arrive at a human being, She asks me to please tell her what the issue is. Since I have had plenty of practice by now I can recite it quickly and subconsciously. She states that she would have to escalate the problem so would I please hold, but then we are disconnected and I never receive a call back. I call back to tech support, they say it was unacceptable that I should have to wait so long. I agreed. But they would have to escalate the issue to a higher tier and would it be okay if they called back in 30 minutes to an hour. After verifying they had the correct phone number I thanked him for his time and hung up. And that's the last I heard from Microsoft. Several hours wasted...\n\nSo then in about 30 minutes I was able to install Office 2007 on the new machine, check and install all the latest updates,  map the network drives, and verify the proper functioning without even having to set trusted locations - and - bonus - was able to request a refund from Amazon, have it approved, and UPS scheduled to pick up this defective product and send it back.\n\nKudos to Amazon for being professional to work with and quick to respond. I am so relieved I bought through Amazon instead of Microsoft.\nMicrosoft - you have a long, long way to go.\n\nSo my advice is to avoid upgrading to Office 365 unless you have a compelling need and do not have a home network attached storage.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Windows XP Professional is perhaps the best version of Windows that Microsoft has released. It's rock-solid, well-supported, and easy to use. It's also ridiculously expensive, bloated, and the anti-piracy measures are nearly draconian (and woefully ineffective to boot).\n\nWhat follows is a pretty lengthy breakdown. If you just want the executive summary, read no further than the following bullet-point list:\n\n- If you don't have any special needs consider XP Home instead. If you truly need XP Professional, you'll know.\n\n- If you don't really need Windows (in other words, if you're not a gamer or need to run an application for work that's strictly Windows-only), consider switching to a Mac. Or even Linux if you're a power user.\n\n- Windows XP is a decent OS under the hood. But lingering security issues, price, and Microsoft's questionable behavior over the years should give you pause.\n\nNow for the extended, in-depth review...\n\nPros:\n\n- Built on the Windows 2000 codebase. It's not so prone to BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) and other random crashes as 95, 98, and Me. I still get crashes, but they're usually the fault of a particular app, and a single crash rarely brings down the entire system.\n\n- Excellent hardware support. It's plug-and-pray no longer; it recognizes and automatically configures a wide range of hardware.\n\n- Well-supported. Like it or not, Windows is the dominant OS. You won't find a greater selection of commercial software for any other operating system.\n\n- More secure than previous Windows versions. With the introduction of Service Pack 2, Microsoft is finally doing something about the rise of adware with improvements to Internet Explorer 6, a better built-in firewall, and a one-stop Security Center.\n\n- Easier networking. Service Pack 2's wireless networking tools are often better than the ones bundled with wireless networking hardware. It's also easier to share files over a LAN, especially in comparison to Windows 2000. But if you need Windows 2000's more fine-grained control, that's available to you as well.\n\nCons:\n\n- Expensive. Microsoft's monopoly position basically lets them charge whatever they want. Sometimes (and if you're a good bargain hunter) it's cheaper to buy a used computer with Windows XP preinstalled than to buy a boxed retail version. It's out of control. More on this later.\n\n- Bloated. And not just bloated, but hard to cut down. Applications like Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, Windows Media Player, Windows Messenger, and Movie Maker are bundled and do not have uninstallers. You'll need some technical expertise and quite a bit of free time to get rid of these apps.\n\n- Still very insecure. Check Secunia or a similar security site, and you'll see that Windows XP and Internet Explorer are riddled with security holes. And many of the critical ones remain unpatched! Save yourself a lot of grief and use an alternative browser like Mozilla Firefox or Opera (but not ones that embed the IE engine like Maxthon).\n\n- The new visual themes are an acquired taste. Some people like big and colorful. I'm not one of those people. Luckily, \"Windows Classic\" is still available. You'll get your traditional desktop and Start menu back, as well as a hefty performance increase.\n\n- Activation. It's not as bad as you might have been led to believe, but it's still annoying. The process takes seconds over the internet, and you don't have to provide any personal information. But if you're in the habit of upgrading and swapping out hardware often, you might find yourself on the phone with Microsoft trying to prove that you're not doing anything illegal. Meanwhile, Windows piracy still runs rampant, especially in third-world countries where a genuine copy of Windows costs a month's wages or more. Hell, it cost me a week's wages here in the U.S. of A. for my copies. (The job market's not exactly laden with golden opportunities for recent college grads. But I digress.) Seriously Microsoft, drop the price. What you lose in the margins up front will be more than made up for by the decreased loss due to piracy.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n- Unless you have ancient hardware (by that I mean computers built before 1997), get away from Windows 9x or Me as soon as you can. Leave that crash-prone monstrosity of an OS behind.\n\n- I'd say get away from Windows entirely if possible. This isn't a viable option for everyone. For gamers, there's no real good substitute for Windows short of a console. Sometimes you'll get Mac and Linux releases, but they're often released long after the Windows version and are not as well supported. Then there are those who need a Windows PC for work. Solutions like Virtual PC and VMware provide a Windows environment for Mac and Linux respectively, but they can be clunky, and you wind up having to get Windows anyway. And of course there are those that can't deal with the Mac way of doing things or can't be bothered with the endless tinkering that a Linux setup entails. But if you just need a computer that gets on the internet without fuss, and you're not beholden to Windows in any way, consider something like the newly-released Mac mini. Easy to use, easy on the eyes, easy on the wallet.\n\n- Power users may want to consider giving Linux a spin. It's still got a way to go before it's a solid desktop OS, but it's getting better every day.\n\n- If you're not a power user and/or don't need the advanced networking features, Remote Desktop, etc. (and really, really must have Windows), go with XP Home instead. All of the stability, most of the power, less of the fat. Cheaper too.\n\n- If you're already using Windows 2000, XP Professional probably isn't a very compelling upgrade. You've already got a very mature, stable, not-too-bloated, well-supported desktop OS on your hands. Maybe the new network features (the better wireless tools in particular) are worth the upgrade and migration cost. I leave it to you to weigh the risks and benefits in your particular situation.\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": 2}

Upon trying to do so, the upgrade created more problems trying to install.  It kept corrupting my registry, and wouldn't install without a hassle.  Like someone else said in a review, Windows ME is nothing but a cardboard box with a label, and a CD.  This operating system IS A VIRUS!  Stay away from it.  Windows 98 SE, or Windows 2000 would be your best bet, and if you don't mind living in the cave man days, and for as long as programs are compatible with it, you'd be better off staying with Windows 95 (as long as it is version B or C).  I hope this review will be somewhat helpful.  The ONLY thing I miss about ME is the movie maker, but I can live without that.  Even the system restore was junk, doesn't work at all.  If you need system restore, purchase Norton Systemworks 2002, which has GO BACK on it, it's the same function, and it WORKS!!!", "label": 0}

{"text": "This version is much better than the PC version of Office 97 I was avoiding when I still used my IBM.  Because of the Mac/Aqua interface, the menu and tool bars are much slimmer and don't feel claustrophobic the way the PC versions often do.  Office X also has an all-in-one formatting palette that can be collapsed or hidden, and editing and creating toolbars is easier than in the PC versions of Office.  Some of Office's other basic features are better integrated than on the PC (you only have to double-click on headers and footers to open them, it's easier to move text around, there are more text colors to choose from, etc.).\n\nStill, Office X has its share of problems:\n\n1.  File compatibility.  In an attempt to dissuade us from using rival word processors, Microsoft only allowed Word to recognize other types of Word documents in addition to the standard text file formats.  This means all of my old WordPerfect and WordPro files need to be saved as Word or as Rich Text Format files (which lose some special features) on my old PC in order to be compatible with Word X.  Also, you can't save Word files as recent Windows Word files, which means you have to save them as older Mac Word files and lose some features in order to read them in PC versions of Word.  It is never really clear how much is lost by saving it in a particular Word format (Word 2004 supposedly has a tool for this now).  PowerPoint has a similar problem--I had to try two different PowerPoint formats in order to figure out which one would be accessible on a 1997 PC version of PowerPoint.\n\n2.  Bugs.  Word doesn't crash every time I use it, but certain actions give me a system message saying \"Word has unexpectedly quit.\"  I have to save frequently because I never know when a particular action--editing a chart is one of Word's favorites, as well as just finishing saving a document--will tend to make it crash.  You ususally can retrieve the lost document, but it still shouldn't happen.\n\nEdit: I've applied a number of Office X updates from Microsoft's website, and that appears to have gotten rid of most of the random crashes.  If you still use Office X, DEFINITELY make sure you install the updates--they make a huge difference as far as stability is concerned.\n\n3.  Font corruption.  I've been able to use fonts without problems in Photoshop and Illustrator, but when I click on the same font in Word it sometimes uses the wrong font (often the next one up/down on the list, even if I type in the font's name).\n\n4.  Slow! If you have OS 10.3 and mainly do simple word processing, you'd probably be better off using TextEdit most of the time (it has a page layout view, the system-wide spell-checker, etc.).  Word takes longer to start up and sometimes lags a bit when you type, especially if you only have Apple's stock 256 MB RAM.\n\nIf you own a Mac and need to share complex documents with other computers, especially PCs, there aren't really any fully native, full-featured substitutes for Office on the Mac.  As things stand right now, I'm sticking with MS Office, but that might change if another major office suite is ever ported to OS X.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.\n\nThe lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.\n\nAs with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.", "label": 1}

{"text": "SmartDraw fills a niche, but doesn't do it well for several reasons.  First, the program is just plain glitchy, and this latest version is glitchier than earlier versions.  Creating an organization chart should be simple, right?  It draws the simplest charts easily, but when you start to add more positions or insert support functions, forget it.  The chart moves all over the place, and no matter how hard you try to move a position around, there are always problems.  I used to love, love, love the floor plan function.  In this latest version, though, you are forced to do many more clicks to do the same functions.  My worst complaint, however, is with the company's management decisions.  I have downloaded this program onto my Intel Mac (partitioned with Windows, ugh!) twice now, and the program keeps disappearing.  I contacted the company, and the response was very matter-of-fact like it happens all the time.  The customer support told me just to download the program again.  Sorry, if I pay for the program, I don't think I should have to download it repeatedly just because the company is so paranoid about pirated copies.\n\nIn my opinion, it is just a matter of time before another company comes along and fills the niche better.", "label": 0}

For example in Word 2000, you have the option of printing first all of the odd pages only, then turning over the stack and feeding it back through the printer and print just the even pages on the back side.  I was told by Microsoft that I could do this with Publisher 2002 but that is not correct.  Then I was told that if I down-grade to Publisher 2000 I would be able to duplex print and that is not correct either.  The second problem is the difficulty in pasting into Publisher my Word document.  Each page had to be reformatted.  It was much easier to copy and paste each page from Word 2000 into Publisher 2.0 than it was into 2002.

You can revisit a session if you get distracted and click something else.  The Bible reading plans are completely customizable to what you want to read, how  often each week you want to read, and even how many minutes each day you want to spend reading it.  When installing the program, you don't have to download all the information onto your computer - you can use just one CD and have all the information that glo provides streamed directly from the internet to your computer (thus greatly freeing up memory on your computer - there is 18GB of info on all the disks!).  According to glo, there's always more content being added to the already vast amount of information included.

However, I did find that Microsoft 2004 was easier to setup and easier to setup the online bank stuff.\nWhen you purchase Quicken, you are not locked into an upgrade cycle.  My old version of quicken still works.  Money displayed a cryptic dialog which led me to believe that Money 2004 would quit working in two years.  I'm not sure about that part (they might have been referring to the MSN money feature).\nI would recommend you try it out before you purchase it.  The trial version is available at the Microsoft website and it is the Deluxe version, without the extra movies and walkthroughs.\nI just found Money too pretty, and that navigating to do simple things like reconcile took some learning.\nMoney 2004 has a feature that will allow you to upload your financial data to the web and access from anywhere.  Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out the privacy policy whether or not Microsoft will resell your financial data.  They certainly don't take any responsibility for the safety of the data.\nIn the end, however, it will probably boil down to whatever checking software you are introduced to first.  If you learn Quicken, you will probably prefer it.  The same goes with Money.  Feature-wise, they are about the same.  Quicken has more reports.  Both will work fine for your needs.", "label": 2}

{"text": "WindowsXP was one of the most anticipated upgrades in computer history, but much like many other things Microsoft related, this product has proven to be more trouble than it is help.\nThere's alot of good to be said about XP Pro. Bootup times are much quicker than any other MS operating system, better user management than Windows 2000, and lots of compatability. My favorite feature has to be the automatic recognition of Plug-n-play devices, which has served as a life saver in quick situations. For those who like a PC with a nice interface, XP has unlimited skinning properties, which is good. But they take up extra RAM, which is bad. Crashes are also down as well, which is good.\nXP Pro has a ton of features that come automatically enabled. I can't list how many of these I've just turned off because they just plain didn't serve a purpose or were an annoyance. The IP addresser of the windows XP messenger has become a haven for spammers. The \"services\" that windows automatically enables do nothing more than take up RAM and slow you down. The System Restore will eat a big chunk of your PC if you don't know how to turn it down/off. The CD burning feature is tricky and pointless. I see no reason why you would use this over a commerical product such as Nero (or even a free CD burning program, such as Burn At Once).\nThis is all not mentioning the numerous security holes in the operating system. Microsoft tries to fix this my automatically running Windows update while you're online. If you have a fast PC and broadband, then you might not notice it going. But if you're on an older PC or have dial-up, then it will cut into your internet speeds and processor speeds.

{"text": "Seems you either love Quicken or hate it.  I'd like to give an unbiased review, if that is possible.\n\n  If you look at reviews in magazines, they basically recommend quicken or Microsoft money by a nose over the other.  I think you have to take this with a grain of salt. I mean, how much advertising money do these two giants pay those mags?\n\n  I've been using quicken over a decade.  It seems each new yearly product offers more bells and whistles, a few design changes, but not too much else as far as useable programming.  I liken it to car upgrades.  They basically change the shapes and lights, but the bottom line is you just want it to get you back and forth where you need to go.\n\n  The most noxious thing about quicken is the cost.  When you already have a functioning version that does what you want, there's no need to pay 60 bucks just to say you've got the latest version (unless you've got money to burn. If you did, you probably don't need this product!) These companies that give you 20-30% off aren't exactly doing you a favor when you don't have to buy the product at all.\n\n  Secondly, the lack of support of its previous product used by banks was the ultimate in customer disservice.  This essentially forced an upgrade upon its users (myslef included).  Customer loyalty be damned!\n\n  Third, it seems each new version has more glitches, at least according to numerous individual reviews.  That's a sign the company is putting more into getting you to buy the product than working on the product to make it better.  There is no excuse for this (Symantic, are you listening?)\n\n  Fourth, there are clearly a few minor things they could do to make the product better.  Do they get any customer feedback and try to add it to the next version????  ((Case in point:  whenever I download mutual fund data, certain funds get reclassified.  Can't they come up with a reliable way to lock features on certain accounts so they can't be changed when you download internet data?))\n\n  That said, I continue to use quicken, but to get around their mistreatment of their customers, I tend to buy only after the product has been out a while and I can get it at a discount of 60-80%.  For instance, I bought 2004 in 2005, and I bought 2006 a month ago. I read the bad reviews  and just wanted to see for myself what the problems were.  I always save a copy of the previous year's data, since you can't go back without deleting and starting from scratch with an older version.  I'm satisfied with the 2006 version, but it doesn't do anything more for me than 2004,2002, or 2001 for that matter.\n\n  Bottom line, read between the lines of the reviews.  A five star, I'd take with a grain of salt.  A one-star indicates a faulty disk or a customer dissatified customer, probably for one of the reasons I mentioned above.  This is still an above average product, but Intuit certainly doesn't command customer loyalty based on the way they operate.", "label": 2}

I have never had an installation or uninstallation issue with VirusScan, and McAfee has consolidated the number of settings (as well as how many levels you have to click through to get to them all) during the last couple of versions.\n\nPersonal Firewall Plus 6.0:\nIn May 2004, I finally moved out of the dark ages and moved from a dial-up connection to DSL. On the advice of a friend, I purchased a firewall program for the first time ever. Because I already used McAfee VirusScan (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment), I chose to buy Personal Firewall Plus version 5.0.\n\nUnlike many of the reviews I read, I did not have any system problems as a result of installing or uninstalling version 5.0. So far, version 6.0 has not given me any problems either. The interface is very easy for me to use, the settings give me just enough adjustibility to do what I need to do, and I have never had a problem with the program starting itself when I boot-up my computer.\n\nFor someone like me, who is completely port illiterate, McAfee Personal Firewall Plus has done exactly what it is suppose to do: block the bad stuff from reaching my computer.\n\nIf I was rating the virus scanner and firewall only, I would give them a 5-star rating since I have never had a problem with the programs themselves.\n\nAh, but this is McAfee we are talking about. And when you buy a McAfee product, you also end up buying the stupidity of McAfee. There are three reasons why this McAfee VirusScan/Firewall bundle only gets a 3-star rating from me:\n\nREASON 1: McAfee has a habit of messing up their programs through the update features, especially the Security Center pop-up advertisement, uh.... I mean feature, that automatically comes with all McAfee products. So far, none of their update bugs have affected me where Firewall Plus is concerned, but the same cannot be said about VirusScan.\n\nREASON 2: As reported by many a reviewer, McAfee's customer service department is a joke. Their live instant messaging service has yet to ever resolve a customer's problem (an overstatement, I'm sure...... but not by much). And their paid service isn't much better. I know many people who refuse to purchase anything McAfee because of past experiences with their customer service department. Can't say I really blame them.\n\nREASON 3: I cannot stand the blatant McAfee advertisement that is known as Security Center. The splash screen that appears everytime you start your computer (and for which McAfee refuses to allow us to turn off) is nothing more than a pop-up advertisement that you pay to have installed on your computer. This splash screen is oh-so-nice in telling you what McAfee products you have yet to install on your computer. It doesn't matter if you are using a competitor's product. Security Center doesn't bother to check to see. It just forever tells you that you don't have McAfee this or McAfee that.\n\nBottom line: If you are having problems with the previous versions, go ahead and buy these new versions. But I don't think the internal engine changes McAfee has made are worth the price (even a rebated price) to mess with upgrading now. Wait for the new versions to come out towards the end of 2005.", "label": 2}

Well, the new iPhoto does work great and is fast, however... the way it organizes the photos on your hard drive is a nightmare. No longer are the photos stored in yearly folders, with month and day sub-folders. Now it stores everything by roll number - which is created when you upload the photos. So if you upload two photos that's a roll if you upload 2-weeks of photos, that's a roll, etc. If you post a lot of photos to the internet, you'll know why this is a HUGE pain. Their solution: save copies of the photos you want to upload into a new folder on your computer. How does that SAVE time?? I'm pretty disappointed and HOPE this is an issue they revisit going forward.

{"text": "Just to let everybody know who reads this review I am not an office expert I have office because I need it a few times a year.\n\nSo what I'm going to base my review on Is the ease and convenience of office 365 compared to the way the box software works. it is so much more affordable if you have more than 1 computer or device.\n\n  So I'll start from the very beginning with my experience with office 365.\n\n  You get a rather small box in the mail and when you open it up there's a business sized card in the box. I suggest you immediately take a picture of the key with your cell phone that way if you lose the box or damage the key you still retain the product key.\n\n  You navigate to the website on the card\nPut your product key and verifies it immediately then you log into your Microsoft account if you have one if you don't at this time you can easily and quickly make one.\n  And then you can download office and you're up and ready to go it's literally that quick.\n\n  What's great about office 365 is you can use it on up to five computers which is really cool. and with being able to save your work on the cloud it's accessible to all of the computers that you have this office  on.\n\n  The downloading of office if I remember correctly was about a gig in size so if you're bandwidth limited this could take a little time.\n\n  Another neat thing is within that five computers they could be Mac or PC --I'm in a all mac household and everything worked without a hitch.\n\nAnd the best thing about it is the price I usually have to have a current version of office on my computer even though I don't use it every day and this seems like a fairly affordable way to do it especially with Amazon's discounted price.\n\n you can also install it on up to five smartphones as well --it actually works with the iPhone .I only played with it for a little bit on there, I don't see me using it very often but if you're in a pinch you can have it there.\n\nSo overall if you need office this is a good, affordable, easy way to get it on all of the computers in your household.\n\nhope this helps you  !!!", "label": 1}

Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).\n\nNote that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!\n\nThe developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a \"copy everything to disk\" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now.

For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to \"Norton Anti-virus 2005\", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just the same, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious bloat of it. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.\n\nSymantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.\n\nSo, should you upgrade?\n\nIf recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up.

I was not able to export data from my old cell phone, an LG 5200, however.  It is supposed to be supported, but I was not able to connect to it using their cable (I did not contact support and have no idea whether it was a faulty cable or problems witht the software -- personally, I suspect the cable).  Instead, I imported my data from Outlook.\n\nI discovered the hard way that line breaks in the data (the comments field) cause the software to fail the download without any meaningful error messages.  After much trial and error, I discovered the problem and had to clean my data externally as there was no convenient way to do so from within the software.  My next attempts failed after downloading only a few numbers as it kept reporting that the phone's memory was full.  I finally figured out (again, by trial and error) that despite indications to the contrary, the software was not clearing out memory before attempting the download (though none of the old numbers could be seen in the directory).  Once I cleared the directory manually from the phone, I was able to download the new directory fine.\n\nLike I said, the software is quirky, but it did work.  Frankly, I doubt that they get much assistance from the phone manufacturers; most of what they accomplish they probably do by reverse-engineering the phones, so something like the memory problem is probably understandable.  If your cell phone directory is large, reentering it by hand would be a real drag -- this is not that expensive and, at least in my case, it worked well enough to be worth the cost.", "label": 2}

In my case, I have worked for companies that are Windows based for 14 years. In this time I have always used some version of a Mac...mostly Powebooks. In the early years there was no option to use Windows on my Mac, so I often found myself using Windows on a desktop at my office. Thus, I have experienced the evolution of Windows over the years. The earlier versions always seemed to complicated and/or counterintuitive to my Mac senses, especially the installing of software and drivers. I also had way too many viruses and crashes (even with virus proetection and fairly good IT support) when using earlier Windows versions. Thus, I have been pleasantly surprised with Windows XP. I currently run it using Parallels on a MacBook. In four months of fairly regular use, Windows XP has not crashed on me. I should note that I mainly run business applications (i.e. Open Office, QuickBooks, Explorer) and for a time I ran Slingplayer (until released on Mac). These applications ran installed with ease and ran flawlessly. Perhaps the only thing keeping me from giving XP 4 stars is the price.

{"text": "I love the Nancy Drew games, they're great. All of them (sans Secrets Can Kill) have been a truly enjoyable experience for me. The Secret of Shadow Ranch is one of those enjoyable experiences. As stated in another review, though, it is not without fault(s).\n\n 1. The Game Screen - Call me old-fashioned, but I tend to prefer the old game screen. It could be because I prefer being able to access my items without having to open up a new mini-window to do so, but that's my take. The larger game window isn't anything amazing, but I like it well enough. I also think that having the journal and cell phone as menu icons instead of something on your computer and an item is great. So if keeping it that way is good, then I guess I can sacrifice the old item system. Perhaps they can put the item box where it used to be, but shrink it by two icons (so it's 2x1), and put the cell phone and journal on the bar, and have the same conversation system as in SSR. Just a thought (or two).\n\n 2. The Ranch Chores - ND has been making lots of progress with the feel of their games lately (actually since Secret of the Scarlet Hand), with their more organic attitude towards puzzles and activities. However, the ranch chores are annoying. Not only can you get kicked out of the ranch for doing them incorrectly (picking an unripe veggie or two?), but you do them three times during the three days over which the game transpires. And speaking of puzzles...\n\n 3. Puzzles - Now, with a lot of this game being based on a \"brain-vexing\" treasure hunt, this may be too far. It seems as though HI threw some puzzles in just to extend the game. Like the ranch chores, the puzzles can become annoying at times (such as a puzzle where you must navigate four magnetic beads through a maze that is partially hidden by wood). The hints throughout the game for puzzles and other such things are almost giveaways at times. I also tend to feel that Nancy shouldn't have to rely on the internet and phone friends for so much of the game, but I suppose it's less annoying that flipping through a \"book\" to find the info.\n\n All in all, it was great. But these flaws are upsetting after the wonder that was DODI, which is HI's crowning achievement to date.

{"text": "I use Quicken for EVERYTHING. I haven't opened or used my checkbook since I purchased it 3 years ago and started using Billpay. I track all my investments, debt, credit cards, everything! I couldn't live without this program.\nHowever, I purchased 2002 as an upgrade from 2001 and haven't even opened the box yet. After reading some of the reviews I'm thinking of returning it. Nothing has convinced me that this version is worth the money. I like some of the new features but I think I can live without them for the amount of money they want for it.\nI'm looking for a version that fixes and improves some things I've experience. For instance, the program is a memory hog and if you have a lot of data (like 3 years worth with me), it's worse. It'll crash my system if I have too much open. I believe this problem is related to the complaint of other users saying it's slow. The program just eats up memory. I think the area of memory management the program uses needs improvement.\nAlso, Quicken needs to be friendlier to broadband. Why do I need to click a bunch of buttons every time I want to get new transactions or get updated investment info? This should be cleaned up and be a little more streamlined and automatic (in fact, this feature is getting a lot of attention the new version of Money 2002 which it has). That also includes tying better into getting my credit card transactions. I don't know if 2002 does that but it should be more automatic.\n\nIf you're new to Quicken this product is worth every penny. If you're upgrading, it may not be worth it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "It will take many weeks and even months to explore all the options and possibilities in Glo, but my initial response is this: Impressive! I've spent two weeks exploring the content every day, and I've barely scratched the surface. The Amazon product description and other reviewers have detailed Glo's content, so instead of repeating the description, I'll share my observations so far.\n\nOverall evaluation--Despite some typos & grammatical errors, this is an impressive body of information. Not suited to objective research (see below) and useful only as a supplemental resource in academic settings, but excellent for personal use and/or evangelism support. Homeschool families in particular will love it.\n\nBIBLE--Included are the traditional KJV and the popular NIV 1984, NIV 2010, ESV, MSG, versions accessible to laypersons and acceptable to conservative Bible readers. It's easy to toggle between versions for comparison. Study guide links to relevant excerpts from the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible. \"YouVersion\" allows readers to add their own commentary to the study notes for each chapter, providing a sense of community and sharing.\n\nTIMELINE--Significant dates from creation (which is identified as happening in 3950 B.C., with Adam and Eve placed at 2500 B.C.) to the death of John on Patmos in approximately 100 A.D.\n\nATLAS--Maps arranged chronologically; just click on the period. Captions tie key events to places, with some editorial comments. Sources would also have been welcome; for example, the map offers two possible locations for the Garden of Eden according to \"two main theories\" but does not identify or credit those theories.\n\nTOPICAL--Index by \"cluster\" branching out from four main terms: God, The Bible, Faith, and Relationships. Each of these categories has a cluster of possible topics; for example, \"Faith\" leads to the headings Man, Sin, Spiritual Beings, The Church, End Times, Creation, Kingdom of God, Eternity, Evil, and Spiritual Warfare. Under \"Relationships\" --> \"With Myself\" --> \"Addictions\" --> \"Internet\" two of the three articles deal with sexual issues (pornography, cyberaffairs); the third linked article (on internet gambling) is available only to Christianity Today subscribers. No mention is made of other internet addictions such as online gaming, shopping, social media, etc.\nSo far I've found only links to conservative websites such as Focus on the Family and Lifeway. (Christianity Today is included but Christian Century is not). While the Glo content is presented as objective reference material, the selection of articles will be satisfactory to Christians who are pro-life or creationist or believe that homosexuality is a sin.\n\nMEDIA--Virtual tours are particularly fascinating to explore--click for increasingly detailed insets nested one inside another. Choices are somewhat arbitrary; detail of the Mount of Olives identifies northeastern view, slopes, summit, Gethsemane, and Church of All Nations, but not the magnificent Church of Mary Magdalene clearly shown directly behind Gethsemane.\n\nMY GLO--Lots of neat personalization options, such as a tool allowing reader to create drag-and-drop presentations. I particularly like the Bible Reading Plan, which let me set a goal and tailor a personal plan to reach it.\n\nNOTE-- This review is the Mac version, which requires OS 10.5.8 or higher. I have OS 10.6.7 with nearly 400 GB available, which should have been plenty. Even with high-speed cable, installation took forever, and the installer crashed twice in process. After each crash I had to start over from scratch, which was irritating.", "label": 1}
{"text": "All I wanted was a burner to occasionally backup my hard drive and various data -- I didn't care about burning music or photos.  The computer store salesman was enthusiastic about Nero5 Burning ROM and, since I had never burned anything except matches, I took his advice.\nBad advice.  Bad purchase. Non-existent support.\nFirst of all, the boxed software comes with a blue, 4.5-inch diameter, plastic disk-like device.  I have no idea what the disk is used for and I can find no mention of the device in the software's on-line manual. So far it's just an ugly paperweight.\nSecondly, when I ran a speed test, I was told the highest speed at which I could burn was 4x on my new Sony (CRX185E1)32x/10x/40x burner. So, assuming the problem was the CD, I purchased 10 new CD-R/RW disks that write from 1x to 24x.  No difference.\nThirdly, Nero informed me I would need 59, 650mb disks to backup the 2-gigs of my 40-gig hard drive that are in use.  The remaining 38-gigs are free, but apparently one must backup even the unused space.  I think.\nAnyway, I have now sent four emails to Ahead tech support asking about the above three problems. After the second email I received a curt and short reply in which the company disavowed any responsibility for the slow write speed, saying the problem rests in the brands of CD-R/RW disks (Sony and Memorex) that I am using and that Nero is perfect. I've received no other replies and I am still without explanation as to the purpose of that strange, blue plastic device.\nMy advice:  Unless you are a computer whiz, an expert burner and you are absolutely, positively certain you will never ever need any support of any kind whatsoever from the Ahead folks, forget Nero.

{"text": "As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is a dialect issue here that can be very problematic since the lessons are taught with the northern dialect and most of the Vietnamese people in the US are from the southern part of that country.\n\nAfter completing a couple of lessons, I felt ready to test my new language skills out on my native Vietnamese friend....  to my surprise I discovered that he had NO idea what I was trying to say! He asked me to try the sentence again speaking more slowly, which I did, but still he was only able to pick up 1 word. So I put in the CD and played the sentence I was trying to communicate to my friend and he could not understand the instructor on the CD either!  The difference in the dialect appears to be even greater than someone from the US trying to understand someone speaking English with a deep Scottish or Irish brogue.\n\nThe teaching style of using just pictures and spoken word to teach the language is pretty good, but there are shortcomings with this. At times it is very difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence being taught just by looking at a picture (this is particularly annoying in lesson 6!).  As was also pointed out in an earlier review... you will need a translation dictionary.\n\nOverall, I like the program and in spite of the dialect issue, I plan to continue using it to become conversational in the language.", "label": 2}

{"text": "QuickBooks is the de facto accounting standard for small businesses, and justifiably so. It's relatively easy to learn and get up and running at a basic level, and if necessary, will provide sufficient data for an accountant to clean up and provide you with proper financial statements. Over the years, a group of bookkeepers well-versed in using the program has developed (mostly women, perhaps because they are over-represented in college accounting classes and often prefer flexible hours); they add value at reasonable rates, and are recommended for medium size businesses.\n\nStill, as with any computer program, the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle applies, and there is a tendency for business people who turn their bookkeeping over to these consultants to ignore accounting controls, especially segregation of duties. Such companies often suffer embezzlements, so it's a good idea to have a CPA oversee the bookkeeper's work and establish controls. Forewarned is forearmed.\n\nI buy a new version of QuickBooks every few years. What I dislike most about it are installation problems, resulting from its security features. Also, the program is backward compatible but not forward compatible, i.e., the 2005 version will read files created by earlier versions, but not files created by QuickBooks 2006 and later. So, if you're a consultant who relies upon files created by others, you have to stay up-to-date.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, Intuit relies upon tech support located in India. I found the young man I dealt with to be quite competent (more so than the typical American tech support person), but had difficulty understanding him because of his heavy accent and his speaking too fast.\n\nIntuit's greed is worth a mention. Once you're on their mailing list, they bombard you with advertising. More significantly, several years ago I noticed that after I installed it, the automatic update feature was quite active, with most of the communication going from my computer to Intuit. I suspect that they were sucking up company information for marketing purposes. This is a serious problem for CPAs (who have a legal duty to preserve the confidentiality of client information), as well as any company that wants to preserve the confidentiality of its own data. So, turn off the automatic update feature and run a spyware checker. And, never, never, never subscribe to the online version.", "label": 2}

It has some great insights on how to add depth and emotional complexity into your stories however...\n\nThe program is poorly constructed and does not do a good job of explaining HOW to use the program and WHAT some of the concepts actually mean.\n\n1)  Poor program constuction and unclear interface - Something as simple as the font on the screen cannot be adjusted.  There were no visual illustrations directing me where to go.  I started with the \"Start Here\" button and proceeded to answer its various questions but after hours and hours of work, I got lost in the forest.  There are no navigation buttons or models to tell you what the end result should look like.  If the final product is a printed treatment, can't I just use the Dramatica inspired questions and write this up on a MS Word document?\n\n2)  Poor instruction manual - As part of its \"attempt\" to explain to me what its vague story concepts are, a comic book and a matrix was added to the package.  What the creators of this program have to understand is that there definitions are not universally accepted terms -- most of them are not even industry used terms.  Unless a user spends hours and hours trying to decipher what its terminology means, there is no way anyone can hope to understand what they are trying to say.\n\nThe end result is a frustrating and outdated mess.  There are apparently 4 versions of this program (I got version 4) but the look and feel of this program seems like it was from 1990.\n\nI am severely disappointed in this program.

{"text": "Like many (most?) Intuit products, Quicken is written in the \"be reasonable - do it our way\" philosophy. The learning curve is steeper than it should be for such a simple product. And if your bank (like mine, Bank of America-WA) isn't listed but provides Quicken .QIF files for download, you can't download them via Web Connect (which Quicken designed for exactly this purpose). Or how about if you want to track PayPal transactions? You have to set PayPal up as a \"Cash\" account, with no provision for .QIF file downloads (which PayPal supports) via Web Connect. Dumb.\nNow, in both of these cases you can download the files separately and import them into Quicken (which is what I did), but the whole idea of Quicken is to automate that process.\nBank reconciliation is not well-designed for the case where you forgot to enter a transaction. The program appears to force you to cancel the reconciliation process, enter the transaction, and start over. There's a way around this (to add a transaction without exiting the reconciliation process), but it's non-intuitive (no pun intended).\nQuicken is designed around the idea that you will PRINT your checks on your computer.  If you hand-write a check, there's no way to directly create a check-register entry with a check number;  you have to create a check TO BE PRINTED, and then, instead of printing the check, you go back and EDIT the check register entry to include the check number.  Not very user friendly if you don't want to \"do it Intuit's way\" (print checks on your computer).\nI bought Quicken because it's essentially free with the rebate that comes with TurboTax.

Poor little program; I should have listened...Unfortunatley I downloaded the patches and the program started working again, like an old man who just wants to die, but is resuscitated back to life by cruel doctors.\nOk, so now the program is working and seemingly protecting my computer with its firewalls and email scanners.  The problem is that these guys are a little too sensitive.  When I try to reply to an email, Hawk (the little email scanner that comes with it) tells me that I might be sending a virus because the email is similar to another one I've sent.  No, really? Maybe because the subject lines are similar or because it has my signature file in it?  Who knows how it decides this.  I have the option of sending it anyway, but then it's not clear if outlook sends it, because the message stays open and doesn't appear in my outbox for a while. Sometimes it does, but, again, who knows what's going on there. So, disable Hawk, right? I can't; for some reason the settings don't take.  Maybe a system restart? Nope. There's Hawk again, protecting me from replying to emails.\nThe \"firewall\" slowed down my machine and would send me to error web pages after my browser timed out.  It's a great firewall; it protects me from everything on the internet!\nI finally uninstalled this piece of [software].  I figure any productivity I lose dealing with viruses can't be any worse than dealing with this piece of [software].  Frequent data backups and the occasional system reinstall would be preferable.\nFinally about the interface.  Why does every company think they should be original and mess with the look and feel of their programs?  Learning how to use a new application should not force the user to learn a whole new user interface.  Where is the file menu so I can shut down the program? Where is the tools menu so I can disable the system tray icon or not have it run automatically when I boot? These things are now called \"tasks.\"  My design issues aside, I could live with the funky new XP'd interface if the \"tasks\" I performed would actually stick (see above regarding disabling Hawk)\nStay away from this piece of [software].  I'm very disappointed in Network Associates.  It looks like they're taking a lesson from the Microsoft book and releasing buggy software and hoping to catch the bugs later.  One problem, MS is a monopoly and NA is not.  Maybe I'll actually try Norton now after years of avoiding them like the plague.  It can't possibly be worse than this.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I went ahead and got this game with anticipation. I was a little disappointed with the first Monopoly Casino game, but what the heck, right? I was hoping that this game would include some of the newer WMS Monopoly games out in casinos (the first one included Once Around, Chairman of the Board and Reel Estate). I was disappointed again. Although the reel slots are much better than the first Casino, they didn't include any real video multiline games (like Movers and Shakers or the new Money Grab), and they still did not include the 3 reel Advance to Boardwalk machine. I'm still waiting. The graphics are an improvement, and the addition of Sic Bo is really a nice touch. I did enjoy the Direct Hit slot, and if it were a real casino slot, I would play it. One other missing link: in the casino versions, the bonus trigger symbol or multiplier animates or has a sound when it hits an active payline. That is missing from both PC versions. Overall, I would say this game is better than the first, but c'mon guys. Let's put out casino games with REAL casino machines. It makes it so much better. Here's an idea: Let us download some updates that would include these.  Let me know what you think...until then, see ya in Vegas!", "label": 2}
{"text": "I've had this software for about a year. I took some time of from using this software to learn some of the kanji (that is the one thing this software does not cover, although it does give an overview of kanji in one chapter) and also due to a death in the family. I just recently started back with my Japanese studies and started this software over. The software reads more like a book (a good book) and even covering the chapters I had already done before was entertaining. When I first started learning last year I struggled with the kana and was using boring hiragana and katakana workbooks. After switching to Human Japanese I breezed through learning the syllabaries and before I knew it, I was reading Japanese without the aid of romaji. The software slowly introduces hiragana, then katakana, then weens you off of the romaji. I hardly noticed this process happening, so it was the perfect pace for me!\n\nEnglish grammar was never a strong-point of mine. But this software does a great job of explaining the grammar and how it relates to English grammar and breaks it down so that it is easy to understand. Using this software, I've had several \"eureka moments\" where a concept made perfect sense after not being able to understand it using other methods of study.\n\nTo sum up, I would highly recommend this software to be part of any beginners arsenal of study materials!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Microsoft Office is pretty much the standard software used by most businesses and individuals.  This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.

{"text": "With some repeating of the previous reviews, comparing with MS\nStreets & Trips 2003,\nPros:\n1. A relatively complete database of points of interest. I can\n  find Walmart, Safeway, Food4less, etc. The advanced find tool\n  is powerful. I can find a name or an address in a city or\n  a part of the map, etc.\n\n2. Voice instructions and voice commands for GPS. If you drive\n  alone with a GPS connecting to a laptop, you will see that\n  this function is very important.\n\n3. There are many advanced features if you dig in. For example you\n  can specify the road preference to a very detailed level; you\n  can create simple road or modify road properties; you can find\n  radio station coverage and traffic condition phone number\n  information which could be useful if you are stuck in a jam or\n  snow storm.\n\nCons:\n1. It's very slow sometimes! My laptop is an IBM Thinkpad, 1.6G Mobile\n  Pentium 4 with 512M memory, 40G hard disk. I think this computing\n  power is pretty good for a laptop. I do not have problem\n  with panning/zooming the map or calculating the route. However\n  switching between tabs can be slow sometimes. Moreover, at first\n  seems the voice functions are, although not perfect, working OK.\n  But the only time I seriously used the voice instructions for my travel, it\n  lagged so much that it spit out one word or two at a time and by\n  the time it reminded me to go on a high way, I was already preparing\n  to come off it. I re-installed the text to speech engine as indicated\n  on the support webpage and the voice instructions became normal\n  again. But how can I depend on such a product to find my directions if\n  it can just go \"dead\" in the middle of the way!\n\n2. It does not work on Windows with languages other than English as the\n  default setting! This will slash a great number of users, I believe,\n  because a lot of people here are not native English speaker. The default\n  language for my Windows 2000 is Chinese. The Find tab just didn't work.\n  I have a PC whose default setting is French because I was learning French\n  on it. I tried that PC and the Find tab didn't work either. I have to\n  convert my laptop back to \"pure English\". I've never heard of softwares like\n  this. Maybe they are still using controls or database engines from the last\n  century. Plain lazy.\n\n3. The map is far from good looking. Two main problems are: at a higher level\n  most road names are gone, sometimes you can not even see the name for a major\n  high way - very inconvenient; the point of interest icon is only a small pity\n  gray dot until you zoom in almost to the last level. In this regard, Micosoft\n  Streets & Trips is much much better.\n\n4. It is hard to use! You really need to go through the user's guide to be confident\n  using it. Sometimes you have to use tricks. For example when I created a route\n  from Davis, CA to a place in Sacramento, the route is supposed to simply follow\n  Business 80 mostly, which has a 90 degree turn from east to north at the center\n  of Sacramento. However, at the turn the software told me to come off 80, take\n  34th street, then turn on to Stockton, and go on to 80 again! I almost pulled my\n  hair off. Now I found the trick: you can specify your road preference as: prefer\n  limited-access roads; avoid local roads; avoid major connections. Then the software\n  will \"smartly\" follow 80. Don't say there's too much artificial intelligence\n  required - Microsoft software did the route effortlessly without me telling it to\n  keep on the same high way.\n\n5. The text to speech and speech recognition engines are old and probably outdated technology\n  from Microsoft around 1998.  The synthetic voice is not very pleasant to listen to.\n  In a noisy car you really need a good headset as well as speaking loud to make your voice\n  recognized.\n\n6. Seems the map data is mostly accurate but not as accurate as Microsoft Streets & Trips.\n  Mostly my GPS icon is on the road fine but some roads it is really off. Never happened\n  with Microsoft software yet.\n\nConclusion: If you are shopping for a nice mapping software and you are not a GPS\nmaniac, just wait for a deal and buy Microsoft Streets & Trips 2004 (the two major\nimprovements for 2004 over 2003 is: 2004 displays one way; 2004 updates GPS data\nevery second. Although maybe a Microsoft trick not to provide them in 2003, these\nare very important features). With a simple serial GPS (~$100) you are in pretty\ngood shape and will not feel terrified while lost.\nHowever if you want to find every Walmart or Fry's in a new place and want to hear\nmachine voice reminding you the turns, get Street Atlas 2004 TOO. Only getting\nStreet Atlas will drive you nuts. Buy both MS stuff and this can give you a robust\nbackup when Street Atlas refuses to work.\nAnd finally, once you hit the road, rely mostly on the road signs and your own brain.\nDon't get yourself killed just because your computer has made a mistake.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I came into Human Japanese with some experience with other software learning products as well as books.  I must say this is GREAT learning software.  Many competitive software products either spend too much time on memorizing phrases or random vocabulary, focus too much on pedantic grammar rules, or make little or no attempt to present the written word in Japanese.  Human Japanese is, in my opinion, the BEST in integrating the spoken with the written word.  You will learn plenty of grammar but it is presented in a user-friendly way. You will get lots of vocabulary, and you will be recognizing sentences in kana before you know it.  But importantly, once you have worked your way through the lessons you will find that your confidence is way up.  There is quite simply an excellent balance between phrases, grammar, vocabulary, and the written word.  And you cannot ignore the price.  Software that is ten times the price is not necessarily better.  If you sincerely want to learn Japanese and put the time in to the lessons, you will make rapid progress and will really surprise yourself.  I am totally self-taught and I must say that the Human Japanese lessons are the closest I have ever had to a personal tutor walking me through the lessons at my own speed and with a real interest in my learning.

Specifically, I wanted to be able to change a page and have the program automatically update links in every other page.  I also wanted to be able to change hosts without updating every link piece by piece.  The problem is, the way I understand it, that it only does this if you are using a web site host that uses FrontPage \"extensions\".  They are not as common as Microsoft would like you to think they are and often cost more.  Another case of Microsoft trying to dominate (and control) yet another aspect of the web.  Even for basic web design, the WYSIWYG feature is very nice and the program is easy to use, but you pay for it. Also, I expected to be able to anchor a picture anywhere on a page but I still don't think that's possible. They could easily add some more capability (easy link updates) for the low end user who doesn't use their \"extensions\" and doesn't mind spending the extra money for the program.", "label": 2}

I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.\n\nAs a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.\n\nCheck out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.\n\nThis program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:\n\nAudible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.\n\nA few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.\n\nI wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.\n\nAnd, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.\n\nIn my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!\n\nThis program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.\n\nUPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.", "label": 1}

Similarly, if you are buying for Macs and don't already have Office 2011 it may be worth the purchase, but otherwise wait until next year.\n\nThe registration process is clear and easy to complete, registration of further computers is also simple, and adding the subscription to your skype account is as simple as putting in your password.

{"text": "As a tool to teach my children to learn to read, I found this game to not be very effective. It was fun for them to play.\n\nAt the time I was teaching my children to read what existed were the earliest Blue's Clues videos, abc's and 123's. They were basic but effective. I do not believe their format for newer versions of Windows has been updated. Also the Blues Clues videos on shapes and colors were valuable. The others were moderately effective for me. There are likely to be better tools now which I am unaware of.\n\nOne other set of tools I found engaging and effective were the Leap Frog videos: Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Code Word Caper(?) and Math Circus. These three LF videos were excellent on inculcating the basics. I hope that they went further with Math. The Math Circus video caught my children's attention and the information stuck. I found other tools for shapes which taught them about parallelograms, trapezoids - shapes that are beyond the minimal 4 that are usually considered sufficient for little children.\n\nWe forget that exposing them to all these sophisticated images and concepts in a simplified and engaging manner when they are very young, is incredibly effective. They are sponges for everything when they are in those early years. My first son learned the Hebrew alef-beth with flash cards at 16 months. He began to read at 2y and 4m.

{"text": "I began editing HTML in 1997 with Dreamweaver 2.  Shortly after that I swithced to Front Page, which was far more appropriate for the kind of web design I was interested in--the text content is far more important than the graphics and doohickeys.  On the recommendation of various web developer friends of mine, I decided to buy and try Dreamweaver MX last June 2003.\nI am first and foremost a teacher.  Web development is a useful tool for me, but not my main interest. I keep three very large Front Page based web sites (all three are in the 100-300 page size range, and very much text based).  FP really made this easy for me.  Dreamweaver MX is targeted at those who develop sophisticated sites with active content--databases, forms, cgi scripts, media (Flash/Shockwave).  It you are that type of developer, then it is clear that Dreamweaver is an excellent choice.  FP is just not up to handling that sort of complexity and flexibility.  But, if you maintain large html based sites that require rapid expansion and reorganization features with a minimum of training, FP is lightyears ahead--easy to learn, extremely intuitive, transparent and very fast.  I can see that if I had started with DW-MX and built it from there that things would have been easier.  A big part of the problem is that Macromedia has not created effective support for making the switch, and their product is definitely not as self-explanatory as FP.\nStill, after a few hours I did figure out on my own most everything else that I needed to make use of the initially overwhelming displayed features.  If you have some experience with HTML, it isn't that difficult to figure out.  But it's definitely not a good choice for a beginner without some classroom training.  It is an impressive package.\nBut, here are the real downsides:  If you depend on FP's shared borders and navigation bars and themes, and your site is bigger than ten or twenty pages, then migrating your web site will be an unbelievable nightmare. Expect to have your shared borders altered and no longer controllable.  Your site will be locked the way it was when you converted it, and new pages will not integrate into the FP navigation structure.  You'll have to rebuild your whole site structure from scratch.\nFurther, as near as I can tell after spending about 12 actual hours probing the manual, help and just plain pushing buttons, I cannot find any feature that is equivalent to the combination of FP's theme, shared border and navigation bar feature. I find this to be highly undesirable. Therefore, Front Page is the superior choice for the beginner, and for the more advanced developer who wants a really streamlined and quick way to create and maintain a large but basic site without having to learn what cgi, asp, php, cold fusion, ODBC, test servers, etc. are all about.\n Oh, and if you have Windows XP Home Edition, don't even bother, because Dreamweaver MX can't work properly without the server features included in the Professional Edition.", "label": 2}

I love how the author program goes over the distinct differences of english and japanese, and then slowly works you into the \"nuts and bolts\" of japanese. I thought i would never learn a language because the concept of learning another languages grammar, spelling, punctuations,etc was just crazy. This program slowly introduces to the concepts of the language and then gives you a chance to read japanese characters. The japanese characters are click-able so you can listen to them. The author also demonstrates on how foreigners make a mistake on pronouncing words and he shows you how himself (He has an awesome voice). Then after a long exercise there is a break in between the program which talks about the culture etc with some nice pictures. I wish i knew about this program sooner! I started using this today and i can read about 20 japanese characters. This program is so simply yet complex! I love it so much and i recommend it to anyone who is afraid of learning a language, interested in learning it, or is interested in it! This is 100000x better than Rosetta stone! I swear to god! I feel 100% confident that i will learn japanese with this program. I would like to thank everyone who created this masterpiece of a product!!!! You surely deserve more!!!

{"text": "UPDATE:...  The issue with the zip and state not matching was resolved by completing blanking my W-2 out that was imported from TurboTax and entering all the information again.  I was on the phone with Tech Support (a supervisor-which I demanded after being told I needed to see a tax advisor because I live in a different state than my employer). Two emails to tech support produced [nothing] and took 2 days for each reply.  Then, I spent 1 hour (on my dime) with Tech Support and figured out the problem myself while on the phone. I haven't tried to print yet, I hope I have no problems.  After my complete experience, I would probably take my rating to 2.5 stars.  I've had 2 people now tell me that TurboTax gave them no problems.  I think next year, I'm switching back.  It's not worth the ... price difference... especially since I spent more than that on long-distance with tech support.  INITIAL REVIEW:  After using TurboTax for many years, then reading the reviews about the spyware software, I chose to go with TaxCut this year. I am here to say there's not much difference in the two products. Program downloaded fine. I was able to download last year's TurboTax information just fine. Interview is much like TurboTax. My taxes are fairly simple (1040 with itemized deductions), I was done in about 40 minutes. Now comes the most frustrating issue (Please help if you'd had this issue yourself). My paycheck (thus W-2) comes from my parent company, which is located in a different state than where I live. The program automatically inserts the W-2 state into my (background info) state field. Therefore, when I tried to E-file, the program found errors (state and zip don't match) and pointed this out to me (and will not let me E-file until remedied). So I changed the state I live in to match the zip code of where I live ... and guess what... the program automatically updated the W-2 state -- which then caused the same error there. Each change automatically updated the other area and so far there has been no solution. (I even tried the Override feature.) I will send another review if (when) this issue is resolved. But so far, I've spent 40 minutes doing my taxes and another hour trying to fix this stupid programming loop to be able to E-file. Surely I'm not the only taxpayer whose employer is located in another state! If this were not an issue, I'd give 5 stars -- and I was a loyal TurboTax user.", "label": 2}

I didn't want to sign up for a Passport, and I didn't want all my browser defaults erased.\nBut alas... that is but the beginning of my frustration.\nThe register only shows about 4 transactions at a time unless you use the \"one line at a time\" option, and then you can't see all the details. There's a window to the left that will not go way, and in 600 x 800 resolution, it just takes up too much room.\nI may be in the minority here, but my financial institutions do not support a connection through anybody's program, and I would just like a decent tool to track stuff offline without living in this ultra-slow... waiting for the internet to respond... mixed environment that combines local processing with internet \"support.\"\nHere's a real \"head's up.\" If you don't have a really fast processor with a lot of free disk space and a pretty fast internet connection, SKIP THIS ONE.

{"text": "In many ways, \"Hidden Evil\" hits all the right notes in a genre that has had precious little serious attention paid to it.  In its Star  Trek adventure debut, Activision comes close to reviving a disappointing  genre.  The storyline is strong--stronger perhaps than the movie on which  it's based.  The voice characterization is, no pun intended, engaging.  And  the puzzles, while perhaps easy for hard core adventure gamers, are hard  enough to amuse those of us with busy lives.\nWhere the game fails,  really, is in its graphical quality.  The graphics are hardly better than  designers obviously believed they were doing better work than that early  entrant into the genre, because they keep forcing 'artful' camera angles on  the player, whether she wants them or not.  These constantly-switching  camera angles don't quite make the game unplayable, but they are annoying  enough to waste your time.  Often, you'll lose track of where you are in a  particular room because the cuts from the various camera angles are so  severe, your location is in no way obvious.  In a few rooms the problem is  so acute that you have to move on faith.\nDon't worry, though.  The  gamemakers have made it largely impossible for your accidental movements to  get you into trouble.  In one especially laughable scene, it's *impossible*  for you to fall off a rail-less bridge, but entirely easy for you to get  gobbled up by an unseen monster.  This, of course, is a significant problem  in a game which otherwise strives for plausibility.\nWIth these  somewhat glaring design faults hanging over the game, the inevitable  Insurrection.  It does wonderfully amplify that plot.  You should also buy  it if you need to keep abreast of the development of the Star Trek genre.  This is an important stepping stone in that process.  And if you're a young  adventure gamer, still uncertain of whether you like adventure games, this  one will help hone your adventure-playing skills while keeping you in a  familiar environment.\nBut if what you really want is to be immersed in  the Star Trek universe, be surrounded by known characters, and solve  puzzles while galavanting around the galaxy, buy the much superior  \"Starfleet Academy\" on DVD.  It's often miscast as an action  game, but in truth it's a grander adventure than this.", "label": 2}

I have even reformatted my hard drive and reinstalled all original software to my computer to get it cleaned of junk file that might interfer with this software.  Originally the software would not open.  After several rounds with technical support, I reformatted and reconfigured the operating system to match this software specs.  Now I cannot record a music CD with out buffering errors that their support say are rare with this software.  The errors are being blamed on my hardware.

{"text": "I have been using Studio 8 SE that came free with my video card for a couple of months and have been amazed at what this product can do and how easy it is to learn. It is also very stable - never crashed.  The only bad things are that it is very slow at rendering (usually take a full day to burn 80 minutes) and sometimes the video gets out of sync with audio, but exiting the program and getting back in usually cures that.\n\nSince several features that I want to use are disabled in the SE verion I decided to upgrade.  I can't buy v8 anymore so I thought I would go all the way to v9 Plus.  The first thing that scared me was that I had my CC number all ready and tried to purchase the upgrade online at Pinnacle's website, which said I should receive free shipping, but kept adding shipping charges onto my order.  I could find no phone number to call to try to resolve the error so I emailed them very clearly about what the problem was.

{"text": "I am only reviewing the OS X version. TurboTax Deluxe is a nice tax package. Tax laws can be confusing and some folks (myself included) can use all the help they can get. With TurboTax, you can either choose to fill in the forms you want, singly, or allow the program to guide you every step of the way. Easy-Step is a good choice, because it can sometimes find deductions you did not realize you could take.\nYou also get a lot of reading material in the way of electronic \"books\", including many IRS publications.\nThe Deluxe package includes a download of the state tax package for any one state, free. If you prefer you can order a disk for a fee. Additional states are charged at full price. ...\nHopefully, the later you purchase this package, the more updated the CD will be. I purchased this early. When I did a check for updates, practically the whole package had been updated - a very time-consuming download, although, all downloads and updates went smoothly.\nFor tax filing, you can choose to either print the forms to mail or you can file electronically. (Even if you use e-file, you can still print a copy of the forms for your records.) The IRS e-filing is simple. State e-filing varies from state to state. New York has finally eliminated the necessity to mail in a signature form, but you must apply for a pin at their website before you can be totally paper-free.\nThere is a good deal of in-program help available and several movies, recorded by tax \"experts\". These can provide useful tips, but overall, are pretty boring.\nTurboTax was not designed for multi-user use in OS X. If you want to use more than one userid, each will have to be an administrator.\nIf you used TurboTax in previous years, you can import data from your prior years' forms. If you use Quicken, you can import data from there, as well.\nI found the program works as designed. I did find some of the multiple-choice \"buttons\" to be quirky. One is highlighted (default choice.) You are supposed to click your choice. If you want something other than the default, TurboTax will not always accept your choice, but will take the default instead. To get around this problem, the tab key can be used to highlight the different choices before you click. If you do find the program took the wrong choice, the \"back\" button becomes VERY useful.\nOverall, TurboTax Deluxe is a much better choice than trying to figure out your taxes yourself. It can find deductions you may have missed, alert you to questionable items that may trigger an audit and help you choose the best option when you need to make filing choices (standard vs. itemized deductions, short vs. long form, for example.)", "label": 2}

{"text": "I spent about a month online reading reviews, talking to friends and browsing websites researching routing software. Originally I was going to start out with an AAA map guides that I saw in Staples until I read the fine print which stated it would not work on the Treo 650 with Bluetooth. After research Delorme and a few others I decided on Mapopolis. Mapopolis gives you a 9 day trial period. The maps where dead on every time I used them and the POI's (Points of Interest) where up to date and extremely easy to use. The Mapopolis POI's just give you a dot on the moving maps while Tomtom uses a 24X24 BMP file so you can get a companies logo such as Dunkin Donuts or McDonalds. Mapopolis initially gave me trouble as they suggested loading as much as you can into the main memory. I drive all over Massachusetts on a daily basis so I needed a lot of maps. Mapopolis maps are set up on a county basis and you download them for each county. This insures you will also be using the latest most up to date POI's and streets. One of the reasons I had planned to go with Mapopolis over Tomtom was the price was cheaper and Tomtom limits you to two installs and then you need to buy everything over again to re-activate it. The initial activation is not too difficult, at least in my case it wasn't. Once you install the maps on your device you are asked to go on the Internet. The site listed never seemed to work so I merely went to [...] and entered the number from my CD, then the number from my copy of Tomtom on my Treo and it gave me a third number which I entered on the device to activate it. This took all of about five minutes. Once I had Tomtom running it took seconds to configure for my Holux GPS and I loved the product instantly! The maps and displays give exactly what you need to know and are very readable even on a small screen. The prompts are easy to hear even in a noisy car. One of my most loved features is the near instant auto re-routes on even across state trips. I have my maps and most of the program loaded on the SD card and was concerned with speed. Mapopolis seemed to take a good while to calculate routes especially once I moved them to my SD card. Mapopolis was very stable and quick and if I had to complain about anything it would be the maps are slightly dated and the POI's only seem to cover about 15-20% of the places Mapopolis came with. The one saving grace here is that they allow you to add in categories of POI's and it is fairly easy to add a `single' POI at a time from Tomtom's interface. Unfortunately if you wanted to add all the Hess gas stations or all the Staples in your state you are going to be clicking and typing a lot on your Palm. Another fault with the POI's is Mapopolis allowed you to bring up information on POI simply by tapping the POI on the screen, when you tap Tomtom's screen you get to the configuration menu's. After having this almost two years I have yet to see a single update from Tomtom. It is plagued with problems about \"not enough dbcache\" to run once in a while and requires removing the battery after running cleanup software. Tomtom acknowledged this in a few emails but never addressed it. Also, the maps have not had a single update either. On the Massachusetts Turnpike it trys to use several maintenance area's as entrance ways which are blocked to the public.\n\nAs an update a few years later, TomTom has yet to provide a single software update and an update for the Maps would cost more than what I spent on it.

Existing backyard features include a fence, tree, raised concrete porch attached to the back of my house.\n\nCreating a serviceable exterior facade of my house was reasonably straightforward, after I got the foundation offset right. The caveat - when editing default dimensions in your plans, be sure to delete the (d) symbol. Merely changing the number will not affect the dimensioning, and it will revert to the default value. This is not documented in the included booklet, but I found it on the support website.\n\nThe 3D views work well, although (perplexingly) this product is not hardware accelerated and supports real-time 3D only in a low quality mode. Still, the software developer in me chalks this up to ease of implementation and widest hardware compatability, so this is excuseable.\n\nBasic modification of the backyard was fine (placing the tree and fence), but at this point I ran into problems:\n\nThe raised planter beds - retaining walls are supported in the context of the contoured landscape mode, however my yard is flat, and the software does not consider low raised walls around planting beds as \"retaining\" walls. The hack is to use the generalized \"landscape feature\", which is drawing tool that allows you to create simple extruded shapes. However, these are not \"walls\" from the software's perspective.\n\nThe raised fish pond - same issue as the planter beds.\n\nFlagstone path - the 2D overhead view of the path worked well, but to my surprise there are no tools for estimating the amount of materials needed. Have 16\" flagstones and a curving path? Want to know how many stones you need? Me too. This ties into a general gripe I have with the software - lack of standard CAD features. The ability to measure areas, volumes, and so on is one of the main reasons CAD is even useful, and these features (by their phone support tech's admission) are completely absent in any meaningful sense. Other standard CAD features such as hierarchical groups of objects are also missing, as are copy/pasting of anything other than individual objects.\n\nPaver patio - curiously, outdoor hard surfaces are implemented as \"floors\" with hidden walls, as documented in the (well produced) help videos. For a landscape program this feels like a strange hack, and falls prey to the CAD limitations above when attempting a materials estimate.\n\nTo summarize: I quickly hit a point where the lack of what I consider standard CAD features made the software irrelevant to my project. If you just want to get an idea of the general look of several design alternatives it may work quite well for you, but for serious materials estimates it falls short. Chief Architect's 30-day satisfaction guarantee is quite generous and their support reps are friendly, so I don't feel like the experience was a waste. However, I will probably not purchase landscaping software in the future without first verifying its ability to do \"proper\" area and volume calculations.", "label": 2}

{"text": "First off, let me say that the content on this DVD-ROM is everything I'd hoped it would be.  Anyone familiar w/ Deadman's hardcopy text (which I also own) will know that the text is solid.  There are a wide variety of quizzes which are useful and well organized.  The videos for point location are great for to refresh your memory on the location of an obscure point you haven't used in several years.  If this was the whole story I would give this product 5/5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, this otherwise useful tool is shackled by unreasonable DRM.  For those unfamiliar with the term, DRM is technology used to limit the ways in which one can use software that has already been purchased.  In this case, the software requires that the DVD must ALWAYS be present in my computer in order to run the software.  This is incredibly inconvenient.  The main reason I bought this software was for its portability.  This is hampered if I must carry a fragile DVD with me to use it.  If I leave it in my DVD drive, then it makes extra noise when booting up and drains extra power from my laptop.  Also, it means my DVD drive is occupied and not available for other disks.  I would prefer to be able to keep the DVD safely in my office or at home, but this is not possible.  Hopefully nothing will happen to the disk.\n\nMy recommendation is to make do with the hardcopy text if you have it already.  The added benefits from the DVD don't compensate for the inconvenience of the DRM.  Also, if you need to use it in a quite place (such as a library or classroom) make sure your DVD drive is quiet, as mine (superdrive in a macbook pro) makes too much noise for these applications.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I was confused by the reviews here, which seem to be all over the map.  In the end, I decided to take a chance and purchase SmartDraw 2012 Standard, which I purchased by phone from the manufacturer.  Their website offered only a downloadable version, and I wanted a \"hardcopy\" on CD.  The person I spoke with at SmartDraw was very helpful in answering questions, and said they can ship a packaged version for an additional $19.95, which I was fine with.  No sooner did I hang up, than I found an email with a link for downloading SmartDraw immediately, which I wasn't expecting, but really appreciated being able to use the software right away, without having to wait for the CD. There was also a second email with links to a series of tutorials - I appreciated this too.\n\nI have started using SmartDraw to create some basic flowcharts and value stream mapping.  So far, the software is quite intuitive and fairly easy to use right off the bat.  In places where I got stuck, the help system has been informative and easy to use.  One thing I'm liking a lot is that while the program takes care of the automatic formatting of flow charts and diagrams, it seems you are not limited to just the symbols and elements within a particular template.  There are some basic drawing tools you can use to create \"custom\" elements on your chart.\n\nThe overall design of the program is pleasing.  It's simple, clean and functional, and easy to navigate.  I wish Microsoft would take a lesson, as the user interface is much simpler than, say, Word or Excel.  There are tons of different types of charts to choose from, many more than you will ever use (anatomical diagrams, anyone?).  For each type of chart there is a library of appropriate symbols and elements, as well as many ready made charts that can be used straight away if they fit your needs.  The automatic formatting, and the ability to customize the fonts, colors, effects, etc., make it quick and easy to produce charts to your liking.\n\nThese are my initial impressions after doing a few charts.  If I run into any significant problems I'll update this review.  By the way, I did not encounter any of the licensing issues or other complaints that some reviewers have.  It's possible that these issues pertained to earlier versions?  So far it's all been straight forward, with nice service and what seems like a good product that will meet my needs.  Maybe the company took note and improved its policies.  The company's website has a complete listing, with examples and tutorials, of all the different types of charts, so you should be able to get a pretty good idea if this product will meet your requirements.  For me, it was being able to see everything included in the product that made me decide to go ahead and purchase it.\n\nUPDATE 3/20/2012.  I've had the opportunity to make some more charts, and I'm really liking the software.  Once I got accustomed to the method for adding, inserting, and positioning elements, I now find it very easy and fast to create charts on the fly.  In fact, it's so easy that I can really use the product as a thinking tool - that is, to work out my ideas in chart form as they develop.  The charts are also attractive; you can change fonts, font sizes, fill colors and shading as easily as you would do these things in a word processor.  The automatic formatting keeps everything looking clean and sharp.  There seems to be a lot of flexibility and few restrictions.  It's working great for me so far.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Rosemond Hill was my first 'Let's Ride' game, and has always been one of my favorites even after it's been replaced with bigger and better games from the same series. It's hardly without it's flaws of course, but really I kind of wish the newer Let's Ride games would take a page from it and implement a few of it's ideas.\n\nFavorite Parts:\n\n-Walking/riding around the farm.\nIt's really a novelty for me to be honest, however this is the one feature I really miss.. I liked being able to walk my horse to the pasture, I liked riding my horse up to the NPC's to talk to them, I just like how real that aspect of the game felt. (Though I don't like how slow your character moves, but that's easily fixed if you're on a horse.)\n\n-Being able to CHOOSE which horse you get after beating a competition. This is the one feature I miss the most.. You have no idea how much it annoyed me when I played newer LR games and finding that I had little to no say in what horses I received. Maybe Rosemond Hill spoiled me.. But it was really exciting being presented with a list of 5+ horses, or less depending upon how you placed, after beating a competition and being able to choose the one you want.\n\n-All the farm chores.\nNow don't get me wrong. I hated doing the same chores over and over again just as much as the next person, especially cleaning out the stalls, and it also didn't help that your character was slower than molasses when doing them.. Still, it felt a lot more authentic than some of the newer games where everything is assembled for you in one convenient screen.\n\n-The graphics.\nNow, in this day and age most people will think these graphics are terrible.. And frankly they are. However, for the time period it was made in the graphics are actually pretty impressive. Especially the horse models. Which can look a little off in some positions, but are still more anatomically correct than the models used in some other games. (Though the LR games made in the past three years tend to have better ones.)\n\nLeast Favorite Parts:\n-The glitches..\nThe game's ultimate short coming is that it's so badly glitched that it can at times be unplayable. You REALLY have to be careful about what you do and how you use your tools, as almost anything that can go wrong probably will. (The stable is the main offender, the rest of the game is pretty non-glitched all things considered.) Here are some things to look out for....\n\n1. Be careful when moving the wheelbarrow out of it's designated spot. I was retrieving it yesterday after replaying the game and I somehow got stuck in between the wall that connects that area with an adjoining stall.. (You can get yourself out of this mess by hitting 'esc', then save your game, and reload it. If you do there is a chance you will be placed outside the wall. In which case you should immediately drop the wheelbarrow and move away. Once clear try getting it again, only this time BACK UP only when getting it out.)\n\n2. Another wheelbarrow issue.. Be prepared to get stuck between the door to the waste area and the stable when you are coming in from the outside carrying the wheelbarrow. For some reason the door won't immediately let you come in from the outside if you have that tool in your hands. Just keep on walking into the open door way, try to be center, and when the door swings back it should knock you inside. If not, keep on trying until it does.\n\n3. DO NOT RIDE JOHN'S HORSE.\nOne of my first mistakes playing this game was trying to tack up John's horse in it's stall to ride it.. I don't know if it's my game that's the problem or what, but doing so in my case is a recipe for disaster. The character keeps on trying to get up into the saddle, in the stall no less, and causes all kinds of collision errors..\nNote: I haven't tried tacking it up in the pasture as far as I recall so it might be a way around the glitch.\nNote2: Melissa's horse Comet does not have the same issues and can be ridden though.\nThere are a several smaller glitches, but otherwise the game is fine. (Just beware of riding near trees, you never know if you'll be stopped suddenly because the game thought you collided with it.)\n\n-The saving system.\nYou know how most LR games allow you to save if you click on a diary of some kind? Yeah, not this one. You have to click 'ESC' and THEN 'Save Game' in order to record your progress. The issue is that you just never know when hitting 'ESC' will allow you to save the game or not. In the case of the latter you have to start back from a previous save to continue. The whole thing seems to work if your character is on her own, but the times when I was unable to save after hitting 'ESC' were the times I was riding a horse.. So be careful of that.\n\n-The unfinished look to some aspects.\nNot really a big deal, but what's up with the big house you can't get into or that one shed with two doors that refuse to open? Not to mention that one large raised area to the side of the stable.. Was there supposed to be an arena there? These are just little nitpicks though. xD\n\nAll in all, it's a good game. There are better LR titles out currently, but this one still holds a lot of charm in it's own right.\n\nAlso.. This game DOES work on XP systems. I replayed my own copy just yesterday and it was working perfectly on my XP run system. I don't know why it is working for some people and not others, then again many older games can have this very same problem.", "label": 2}

This video is in my opinion, for advanced beginners on up.  I say this because the material is covered more deeply than what a beginner in the field of digital photography might be comfortable with.  Also, it is assumed that the student has some knowledge of digital photographic concepts (white balance, exposure, RAW format, etc.).  These topics are discussed without much intro-type explanation for beginners.  For me this is a good thing, as I had a reasonably good background going in.\n\nThe only thing that I wasn't thrilled about, although it is no reason to drop a star, is the pace of the training.  I actually like a faster pace.  If something is too fast, I just play it over.

The only way I could speed things up was to skip ahead in small increments and then go back if I went too far.\n\nHere's the bottom line.  You can have no experience with Lightroom, but if you are a beginner with digital photography, bone up before hitting this video.  You'll get much more out of it.

Received the product in less than a week after placing the order and it works just fine!\n\nBackground: I had a Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium trial version installed on my computers, and towards the end of the trial period I needed to decide whether or not to buy it from Microsoft or somewhere else. To purchase the annual subscription from Microsoft, it costs $99.99 for one year or $9.99 per month.  Instead, found the key card on Amazon for $69.99 (for the mailing option, mind you the instant download option is still $99.99).  If you can wait for 6-7 days, just order the PC/Mac Key card.\n\nSince I was purchasing the license from Amazon, to avoid getting billed by Microsoft in the meantime, I deactivated my license from my account on the Microsoft website. After the key card was delivered, all I had to do was login to my Microsoft account and update the subscription key. It accepted it without any issues whatsoever. Also, when I tried to open up MS Word, it asked me for the subscription key and to activate the license which I did. This process works for renewal as well.\nNote: If the office software keeps asking you to update the key even after activating the license, just reboot your computer. That solved the problem for me. The entire process took just 10 mins. So go for it!", "label": 1}

{"text": "A couple of people have made critiques about the \"book\".  What book?  There is no book!  You get a leaflet on installation and oh yes,  there is this thing that gives you sample chapters from three actual books  on Visual Basic 6.0.  They were Microsoft Press products, of course.  The  entire program is via a CD.\nIt was slow going for me at first, I had to  constantly adjust the various windows from both the tutorial and from the  actual Visual Basic 6.0 compiler to view everything I needed.  I was using  1152 by 864 resolution.  Fortunately after a while, I learned how to size  and place things so that I would need little readjustment later.  You will  spend the first 10% to 20% of the course becomming familiar with the Visual  Basic programming environment before delving into actual code.  It took a  bit of  getting used to.  I had been previously using C++ and QBASIC  compilers for short math/physics related programs (I am getting a  mechanical engineering degree).  At first you will spend most of your time  learning what icon does what and what window is for what.\nThe tutorial  became easier after I knew what icon to click or what window to open.  There are \"videos\" of programming that you can just watch but  should either mimic step by step or follow making your own variations in  code.\nThere are tweleve quizzes with about seven questions each.  If you  had done some programming before, you can usually guess most of the answers  after only skimming the text.  I wish the program gave me more objectives,  however (writing my own versions of what I was SUPPOSED to write wasn't  enough).  I completed the course still a bit weary about starting a  project.  I'll have to go back over some parts of the course before  starting something even remotely complicated.\nKeep in mind that this  course really only covers the fundamentals.  It ends with the basics of  object-oriented programming.  If you want to learn enough Visual Basic to  be capable of professional work, you'll probably need to buy an  intermediate or advanced level book on VB 6.0.", "label": 2}

Most of it is really impractical, unlike the Pimsleur CDs which I really like. For example, Rosetta will teach you early on \"The boy is running. The horse is eating a carrot\" while Pimsleur prefers things like \"I want to drink a beer. How much is it?\" for early lessons.  As you can see, the practicality of the latter far exceeds that of the former. Proably because Pimsleur focuses on statements involving \"I\" and \"You\" instead of the 3rd person.

{"text": "I have read the other reviews of this product, and wouldn't dispute any of those users experiences with it. There are however many things that become evident once the shine wears off and you try to go beyond the simple spinning cubes you can get running in ten minutes or so.\nI have been using DarkBasic now for several months, and while I was initially as enthusiastic as most of the other reviewers, I have run into enough problems that only become apparent when you try to go beyond the basics that I feel compelled to submit a more balanced review.\nFor example.. while one review mentions the built in help system that has a brief description of each command, what they failed to mention was that this brief description is the only description of the commands available at all even in the printed manual. The printed docs and the online docs are one and the same, and they are not only brief, but provide circular definitions in many cases, and they are definitely not comprehensive descriptions of what each command does.\nThe reviewer also mentioned the extensive examples, but failed to point out that the examples are lumped into several huge programs that do nothing meaningful except to demonstrate one particular way to use each command and do nothing to help you figure out how to use each command in all possible ways. Again.. there is no comprehensive reference to all of the commands the language provides.\nThe online help forums are indeed helpful, but more to the point you will almost certainly have to go there to find out how to use the language. Sufficient information and examples are not provided in the box to use this language on your own, even if you are a professional developer.\nFamiliarity with Direct X will only help out so far. While DarkBasic Pro is really a thin wrapper for accessing the underlying functionality of Direct X, most of the familiar Direct X terminology has been hidden and replaced with new terminology that is never explained leaving you guessing and experimenting just to find out how a command is supposed to work.\nUpdates for the program are also few and far between. There are many bugs in the various commands that make entire sets of functionality impractical to use, and many of the DarkBasic forum members have games they would like to ship, but cannot do so until and unless updates are provided to make functionality that is advertised as being in the product already work.\nWord is that there may be an update sometime around the fall, but if you are used to using other development tools and getting frequent patches, give some thought to how this kind of infrequent update policy will impact your schedule. You should also check out their online forums and make sure that the features you think will make your development cycle go smoothly work as advertised. Some of the documented commands have actually been removed from the language, although they are still listed as valid commands and provide no indication that they have been disabled when you try to use them (other than simply not working).\nMy feelings about this product are not entirely negative. It is a very useful tool for rapid prototyping of 3D experiences, and it's a great way to explore Direct X concepts. As the teacher who wrote an earlier review said, it allows you to focus on the game aspects without worrying about the low level details, and it is also very cost effective.\nThere is also an SDK that allows you to expand the language by writing a DLL in C++, and there are many such free and inexpensive third party DLL's to expand the language beyond the basics.\nBut it falls short as a professional development tool primarily in the areas of documentation and simply working completely as advertised. You would probably find that you can get your idea implemented halfway five times faster than in some other game engine, but you might also find that after getting halfway there, something doesn't work and you need to spend a lot of time trying to come up with a workaround or having to redesign things using different commands.\nIn short.. if you just want to experiment with and learn about 3D, this product is perfectly suitable. If you want to use it to develop a professional game, or you want something that just works out of the box and doesn't require a lot of guesswork and experimentation, you may end up dissapointed.", "label": 2}

While most reviews have been very helpful in pointing out bugs (roofs, cabinets, etc.) they are lacking in some very important information to me.  I think that if you review a product like this you should at least include the exact version number to reflect whether you've upgraded the software with the manufacturer's patches.  I don't have any way of knowing if you are complaining about a problem that has been fixed in the current patches available.\nAlso, just an interesting note:  Again, I'm not an architect but Lotzatoyz made a big deal about square footage calculation errors.  If you take a 20x20 room and simply multiply them you get 400 which he expected.  However, I'm curious to know if he is not viewing the \"floor space\" or \"interior dimensions\" of a room that is 20x20 on its exterior.  A single 20x20 room (assuming that it was framed with 2x4's (which are only actually 1.5 inches)) means that the actual \"floorspace\" would require you to subtract 3 inches from the width and 3 inches from the depth of the room (1.5 x 2walls = 3 inches per dimension).  That would give you a 19.75 foot width and depth as the true inner dimensions of the room.  Any room with these dimensions would have an internal square footage of 390 square feet.  That is amazingly close to the calculation that he quotes from the software.  Now, perhaps the software is truly reporting this 392 as perimeter square footage.  In that case, I'd like to hear the manufacturer's explanation for this.  It's strange to me that no other review mentions such an important (if true) error.\nAlso, this small \"floorspace\" glitch is really exagerated when used in rooms that have cabinets like kitchens and baths because the usable floorspace does not include any square footage under such cabinets.\nI checked the manufacturer's website and the FAQ's page about this product and they give specific instruction on how to \"disable\" the live-view rendering when you are not using it so you are not continuously rendering a view that you don't need to.\nI'm not trying to come off as a big Punch proponent.  I've never used any Punch software product and I certainly don't work for them.  I'm just researching the software out there for my own potential purchase and found Lotzatoyz comments to be more likely fuled by emotion rather than fact.  (Probably).

An (Indian) technician, very friendly, set up a program to access my computer. After he had worked for some time trying to install Office 365 he informed me that I had some malware (Zeus) on my computer which was the reason that Office 365 could not be installed. He told me that someone else in his company could fix the problem, he would transfer me. The next technician (American?) said he could fix it but this would cost money which I had expected. He offered me a yearly service contract for $150.00 plus $20.00 tax. He tried to talk me into a multi year contract which I refused. When I attempted to pay with my credit card the charge was refused by the bank. The same result with my second credit card. The technician told me I should call my bank \"but not tell them it was for a computer company\". The charge finally was accepted and he started  working on my computer which I could follow, though not understand, on my monitor. After about three hours of activity the first  technician called and told me that everything worked now and Office 365 was installed. So far so good.\nNext day I got the invoice from SINGH TECH for $170.00. A few hours later I received an e-mail with a fraud alert from my second credit card that they had denied a suspicious charge of $170.00\nI have not received from SINGH TECH any information what was done to remove the virus nor do I know what the service contract entails.

{"text": "My company's Microsoft rep recently gave me a T-shirt that reads \"Office XP - upgrade today!\". I write this review to reclaim my soul. Office XP is NOT a necessary upgrade, nor is it necessarily the best option for a new system.\nA point-by-point comparison of the latest and the last version of the suite is not necessary, as they are virtually identical. Aside from minor enhancements, the only noticeable new feature is a MS Works-like \"task pane\" which takes up valuable screen real estate (thankfully, it is easily disabled). Perhaps the most talked about aspects of the new Office are the Activation Wizard (which restricts multiple installations) and the fact that \"Clippy\" doesn't appear as often. I am rather annoyed that I will probably have to call Redmond after upgrading my new PC, but given rampant software piracy, I understand the motivation (let he who has no \"offsite backups\" cast the first stone). And let's face facts: if you can't figure out how to turn off the talking paper clip, you probably need the talking paper clip!\nBottom line: the money you save buying Office 2000 will more than make up for any \"features\" in XP you miss.

{"text": "Hey, Virtual PC isn't going to allow you to find a cure for the common cold, or cancer, or provide world peace. It is a tool, and I believe people may have set their expectations too high for anything but a real PC to satisfy. Time for a little trip back to reality, k?\n\nFirst stop at Reality Junction is ... system requirements. Here is the reality of the situation - what ever you have, it isn't enough. Ever. There is no such thing as too much RAM or too fast of a processor for VPC. OK, I take that back - as I write this there is an issue where you CAN have too much RAM for VPC. It seems if you have more than 2 GB of RAM, VPC won't run on an Power Mac G5. You have to have less than 2 GB of RAM for VPC to play nicey-nice with your Power Mac G5. If the past is any experience, expect a patch for this from Microsoft in February. Of 2008.\n\nIf you need real horsepower and speed - go buy a real PC.\n\nNext stop in Reality Junction is ease of use. Gotta calls 'em likes I sees 'em and Microsoft has continued the Connectix traditional easy install. Just follow the directions and you will be fine. Any Mac owner should be able to install and configure their Virtual Machine (read: PC) quickly and with a minimum of fuss. Working with Windows XP is another story entirely. What? Was this a result of an internal contest at Microsoft to foist upon the American consumer the most user-abusive software imaginable? If you want ease of use, what are you even thinking of buying VPC 7? You have a Mac, so build a bridge and get over it!\n\nLast stop in Reality Junction is value. This is where anyone honest has to call the baby ugly. Well, anyone that has been using VPC since version 1.0, like I have. There just isn't any there, well... THERE. Within spitting distance of the price of this software are a plethora of cheap, basic PC's. Why go with a pale imitation when you can be used and abused by the real thing? Go whole hog and dive into the world of hackers, spyware and virii that will lock your computer up tighter than Fort Knox.\n\nSeriously, there is not that big of a price spread between Virtual PC and a real PC. To me, it would be worth the extra speed to just have the real thing, warts and all. VPC at $100 makes a lot more sense than $200+. I think this is what Microsoft had in mind all along, but that is for another time, another review. The reality is VPC is never going to be \"like\" a real PC, but always will be a pale imitation of a PC. Hey, what do you think \"Virtual\" means, anyway? Ok, granted that Win98 on VPC 7 on a G5 just screams, but I could throw away less than the cost of VPC on used iron and do the same thing. So, where is the value?\n\nBottom line - for everything but e-mail and web surfing you are better off buying a cheap, throw-away PC rather than VPC. And if that is all you are going to do anyway, why aren't you just using your Mac for that? VPC is for desperate Mac people that don't want to deal with the icky downside of a real PC, plain and simple. Everyone else would be better served biting the bullet and getting a $300 PC to kick around.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Well, it's finally here....after all the hype, all the M$ brainwashing, Windows XP is here for the taking.  I've been playing with this \"greatest thing since sliced bread\" that came on my new laptop that I bought three or four weeks ago.  My desktop is still running Win98.  I've read most of the other reviews that have been posted and as usual, some liked it, some hated it.  Personally, I'll take a middle-of-the-road stand on this one.  Hence the three-star rating I gave it.\nOK, I'll admit that it's real artsy-fartsy.  Nice and pretty with lots of bells and whistles.  You know what they say about bells and whistles...they're the last refuge for the insecure and talentless.  Anyway, there's a few things about this that really irritate me.  First is this activation thing.  I have a problem with M$ telling me what I can and can't do with something that I've paid for. (this is assuming that I buy it for my desktop)  I tend to change internal hardware often enough that I see this activation issue as a royal pain in the butt!  Microsoft is concerned about privacy, but what about the privacy of my computer?  What concern is it of Microsoft's how often I change my hardware that they feel their software should monitor that?  Second, I'd rather use Easy CD creator 5 platinum for burning CD's since the way XP does it seems a bit archaic to me.  Third, Microsoft's \"coincidental\" exclusion of support for a few pieces of hardware such as Logitech Mouseware since M$ makes their own mouse.  Easy CD Creater isn't supported because CD burning capabilities come with XP.  Some DVD player software isn't supported for the same reasons.\nAs for the stability issue, granted, it's probably more stable.  It should be...M$ has had long enough to get it right and keep the backwards compatability out of it.  But in all honesty, and I swear this on my mother's grave, I never really had any major issues with Win98 crashing on me.  Sure, once in a while it would bite the bullet and crap out, but not often enough to be an issue, mostly just a slight inconvenience.  Most of what I do on my desktop is graphics and believe it or not, I've had both Photoshop 6 and PhotoImpact 6 open with rather large images open at the same time along with  a web page, Word 2000 and e-mail and have not had my machine crash.  I'll go for days and weeks with no glitches on Win 98 whatsoever.  I'm not a computer expert, but I've been around the block enough times to know that it isn't always the OS or the programs that are open that makes the OS crash.  Sometimes the person at the keyboard lends a hand as well.\nSpeaking of graphics and pictures, there's photo software in XP that acts as a browser, editor, organizer,blah, blah,blah.  For that stuff, I'll stick with ACDSee 4.0.  It's far more functional.\nForgetting that XP is in my laptop, I believe I'll hold off on updating my desktop for a while.  As with anything Microsoft, I'd bet a paycheck that in three to six months there will be an \"XP Second Edition\" (or some similar name) that will come out with all the patches and bug fixes that will come along and possibly the inclusion of additional drivers.  That will give me time to road test this OS on my laptop.  At least at this point I've sort of got the \"best of both worlds\" for now.\nThere's no doubt in my mind that eventually we'll all end up XP'd as more and more programs come out for it and the older OS's begin to fade away.  Win 95 is officially dead already.  How much longer for 98 and ME?  Time will tell.\nDon't get me wrong here, I'm not bad-mouthing XP at all.  There's some nice, useful stuff in here.  But it's only useful if you have a use for it.  As I said, my biggest gripe is the apparent continuation of M$ to basically say \"play my way or I'll take my ball and go home\".  So, think carefully and do your homework before you run out and drop a hundred or two on this.  Make sure you have enough system and that it's not too old as well as making sure you can get drivers for anything that XP doesn't support.  My desktop isn't quite a year old and XP says there's compatability issues.  And make sure you need the extras that come with XP.  There's not a lot of sense in buying what you never use or something that a separate program you already have does for you and may even do better. (CD burning for example)  It might be best to watch, listen, and learn over the next few months and see what happens with the release of an updated XP.", "label": 2}
{"text": "All of the other people that have reviewed this game are correct.  Some of the points are pretty picky, especially when this game has far greater flaws than annoying voices.\nIt is true that this game does allow the computer players to make deals and build on properties out of turn.  Even more frustrating is when the computer interrupts you during a deal your trying to make with another player, to do a deal of it's own, and thereby cancelling your deal.\nHowever, the most upsetting thing about the game that no one has mentioned is that the game simply cheats (it is very clear and obvious).  I have played several games (winning only once) and every game has gone the same way.  As you aquire properties, the roll of the dice time and time again will hardly ever roll in your favor.  I have owned entire sides of the board or corners of the board, and for about 6 times around the board the other players will not land on your properties, but you will land on all of theirs.  In one instance I had another player go to jail 5 times in a row around the board avoiding my properties.\nAnyone who plays this game will take notice of my point.  The roll of the dice seems to be calculated by the game according to the situation.  This is wrong.  The dice should roll by chance, and that has nothing to do with a \"difficulty\" setting.  Although that is also true.  There is no difference in the difficulty settings.\nAlso, this game is a drop from Monopoly 2.  This version does not offer a board editor as Monopoly 2 did, and there are a few picky graphic flaws in this newer version.\nOverall, the graphics are good and the gameplay is ok.  Fix the cheating, the playing out of turn frustrations and it would be a lot better.", "label": 2}
{"text": "The beige G3 desktops are supposed to be supported by OS X 10.1, but this is not really the case for some users. Specifically, there are issues with SCSI and with the onboard video.\nThe onboard beige G3 SCSI system has a fairly shoestring termination system which worked under classic, but which fails miserably under OS X in some cases. OS X 10.1 wouldn't boot until I replaced my Apple 12X SCSI CD-ROM with an IDE CD-ROM at Apple's suggestion. Then, it wouldn't finish an install without crashing until I replaced my Apple 2GB SCSI hard drive with a Maxtor IDE hard drive, again at Apple's suggestion. My SCSI Zip is hit-and-miss and sometimes works, but often requires a reboot; my Microtek SCSI scanner isn't supported at all.\nOnce everything is installed, Beige G3 users will find that OS X is SLOW to resize, draw, and scroll windows and that many games don't work. This is because the OS X 10.1 drivers for the onboard ATI video in Beige G3 systems do not use any of the acceleration features of the video chip. Thus, all operations involving graphics, games, etc. are truly time-consuming and annoying -- just resizing a window takes 10 seconds or so and the movement is not smooth, but is jumpy and difficult to manage.\nApple say they have no plans to develop proper drivers for the video chips on Beige G3 systems, nor to fix the onboard SCSI support for Beige G3 systems. Fairly frustrating for those who bought G3 systems with the expectation that they would be usable for some time to come.\nConclusion: If you own a Beige G3 and have upgraded your system with a PCI SCSI card, a PCI video card and a PCI USB card (to which your Zip and scanner are attached), then go for 10.1! If on the other hand you have a Beige G3 and are trying to use built-in SCSI, built-in video and no USB, you will probably be somewhat disappointed by the performance of 10.1 and the lack of support for external devices.", "label": 2}

But only if you PRINT them. I was dissapointed that you can't load the maps into the Garmin Vista, only waypoints. So now all I can do is mark the trail the map so clearly shows on the computer, as waypoints against a blank field on the GPS. The only thing it didn't show, was the dirt road that led to the lake, which was an official Dept. of Natural Resources boat launch. Go to Maptech.com, and check out your favorite area for yourself.\n  If you want to load maps, then go hiking, MapSourse is best. If you want to plan a hike on the computer first, Maptech is best.

{"text": "Pros\n- Introduces Hiragana and Katakana characters by teaching stroke order and pronunciation. The characters are introduced little by little with the help of a quiz, making them much easier to memorize as opposed to learning them all at once.\n- Helpful cultural notes are dispersed throughout the software\n- Concepts are introduced in an easy to understand, conversational way\n- Audio recordings for all Japanese words and phrases\n\nCons\n- Too much vocabulary is introduced at one time\n- The vocabulary and concept quizzes are awful. There is no way to choose how many or which words are used in the quiz, it just quizzes you on everything in the chapter at random and indefinitely, making the quiz practically useless for chapters that have a lot of vocabulary, like chapter 28, which has 39 pages.\n- There are no exercises whatsoever, only readings that do not require any user input. Because of this, in my opinion, coupled with the horrible quizzes, retention is rendered almost impossible.\n- Some concepts are introduced seemingly at random. For example, the particle \"ni\" is introduced in chapter 20, but the particle \"de\" isn't introduced until chapter 35... The problem with this is that both particles are very similar in meaning and it would make a lot more sense to explain both of them at the same time. The result for me was that, for a long time, I incorrectly used \"ni\" in places where \"de\" belonged.\n- Verb conjugation isn't explained at all. This to me is the worst part of the software. When the author introduces verbs, he introduces them in their \"-masu\" and \"-te\" forms instead of their dictionary forms. This makes it impossible to know what is actually happening to the verb. For example, when he introduces the verb \"iku\" (to go), he introduces it as \"ikimasu\" and \"itte\", providing no explanation for how \"ikimasu\" conjugates to \"itte\". In fact, the only way to know how this happens is to know that the dictionary form of \"ikimasu\" and \"itte\" is \"iku\", but he doesn't even mention it! There is also no mention of the difference between \"u\" verbs, \"ru\" verbs, and irregular verbs, leaving the user with the impression that the \"-masu\" and \"-te\" forms must simply be committed to memory.\n- There are several typos throughout the software, including a typo in one of the Japanese examples.\n\nOther thoughts:\nI bought this software as a result of not being able to take the first two intro Japanese classes at my college. I figured that if I used this software, I could opt into the third course and continue from there. My reason for choosing Human Japanese was that I thought it would be much less overwhelming compared to using a textbook. Fortunately, it was. However, if I could go back in time I would definitely choose to use the Genki textbook instead. I was able to opt into the third class, but after going through the first Genki textbook and doing all the exercises, I can say confidently that the Genki textbook isn't that difficult to navigate and far more rewarding and informative.", "label": 2}

I've got both and found this product cheap, in every sense of that word. Rosetta stone was definitely the better product of the two, and was more what I'd call \"immersion.\"\n\nInstant Immersion is not immersion, it's mostly memorization (more so than Rosetta Stone). This is not a product you could really learn the language from. I'd say it's best use is for a student in a low level Spanish class to get a little more practice.\n\nAlso some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp. for instance \"azul\" becomes \"athththul\" or \"azcar\" becomes \"ah-ffffu-cah\".\n\noverall: this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other Spanish class. you almost certainly will not learn Spanish from it, at least alone. then again it would be hard to learn it solely from Rosetta stone, so at least this is cheaper.", "label": 0}

The story was the spookiest and most supernatural of all the rest, and that was an excellent move by Her Interactive. I played on \"Senior Detective\" level, which is the step up from Junior.

{"text": "This is my 26th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.\n\nFirst, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.\n1) The game itself\n2) My personal detective work.\n\n* PART 1 *\n\nPLOT: Nancy is promoted to makeshift curator after her internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. gets disrupted by a sudden theft of the Pacal jade carving!  What is with those cinnabar handprints and why is she in another mystery!?? Can't a girl catch a break?\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 83\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nJoanna Riggs: The original curator of the museum that is hanging on to her job after indiscriminate past dealings with finding rare artifacts.  She is hard-nosed with things running correctly and I found her type pretty typical in this career position.  I don't feel she is as moral as she wants to seem, but since she isn't bothering me, I overlook that for the most part.  I never considered her a culprit.\n\nHenrik van der Hune: A epigrapher that took a tumble on the indoor temple steps. I had to help restore his memory and always felt he was both a straight-laced boring personality to an outright professional in his career.  I never thought he could be the culprit.\n\nTaylor Sinclair: An art dealer in close connection with Johanna. This is the epitome of the sleazy criminal look with the thin mustache, shallow chin, and greasy hair. I didn't know if HER was putting up a facade with an obvious guilty caricature so I was 50/50 in my decision.\n\nAlejandro del Rio:  The U.S. ambassador to the mexican  consulate; he seems firm on righting wrongs that have taken precious artifacts out of the hands of his home country. He was my top option as the culprit because he seemed too handsome and proper somehow for the anger that could be felt beneath his demeanor.\n\nBESS/GEORGE/HARDY BOYS PHONE CONTACTS:  The girls were entertaining as always, but there was only so much they could actually help me with; same for the boys but on an even lesser level.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 82\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\n\nThe music was pretty uptempo and brought one into the mysteries of the Mayan culture.  Graphics were pristine for that early game design period.  Out in the museum garden, those bird noises were pretty unique. Was that a crested Guan?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 84\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The three levels of the Mayan temple reserved for fill-in answer quizzes, basket hoop throwing, and the BUL game, kept my interest for the time being, but they were't challenges that you would describe as overly fascinating. The audio translation match was intriguing because it also helped you learn about the Mayans throughout the entirety of the museum which gave this particular adventure more of a \"learning series\" edge.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 85\n\nGENERAL IOTAS: I wouldn't call that corpse in the monolith a mummy [aren't those properly prepared?].  Why was a missing part of the escape challenge in the Whisperer's mouth? Doesn't make sense.  Also, why was the culprit using that scarlet hand imprint? I never got any explanation of why that was significant.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: I read too much into how tricky HER might be in this adventure, but it turned out \"not that much\". Why were all three of the innocent characters awaiting me as I exited the monolith? That was a weird situation in which I would want some answers on how this came to be.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: Even = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days [12 hours] and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 62\n\nMy Strong Points: My memory was pretty impressive by memorizing the facts of Mayan culture meant for the quizzes and my adeptness at puzzling the pottery and key parts together was there.\n\nMy Weak Points: To save on time, I used a walkthrough only to bridge me from one part of the plot to another without delay. Um, I used this a LOT.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 62/ 2 = 73 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I was pretty bored I must admit, but not because the game was poorly designed. I think that anything that has a setting being museum-focused is bound to make me stare out the window wanting for better days.  This comes in at average overall entertainment with very interesting highlights towards the end.\n\nThus far, on my list of the 26 completed ND games, SCARLET ranks.... # 16 !!!!!\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 90\n2) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87\n3) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 86\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5\n5) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 83.5\n6) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 82.5\n7) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 82\n8) SECRET OF OLD CLOCK  * 81.5\n9) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 80\n11) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 79.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 78\n13) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 77.5\n14) LEGEND OF CRYSTAL SKULL  * 77\n15) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 75.5\n16) SECRET OF SCARLET HAND  * 73\n17) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 72.5\n18) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72\n19) THE SILENT SPY  * 71.5\n20) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 71\n21) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 70.5\n22) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 70\n23) LABYRINTH OF LIES  * 69.5\n24) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 69\n25) RANSOM SEVEN SHIPS  * 68.5\n26) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 66.5", "label": 2}

{"text": "Learn By Video Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3\n\nI have Lightroom 2.7 so I was intrigued for two reasons: 1) what is new in Lightroom 3 that I should upgrade and 2) could I still learn something about the version that I have with this video. I am happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe lessons are good; I actually look forward to learning more about Lightroom. The lessons are always focused on the computer screen - not wasted on watching the instructor speak. First I went through some of the lessons to get an overview of the features - some I found were explained in a way that made me realize that I should have been using them. But I will really use this as a reference when I want to work on my photos with the Watch and Work.\n\nWatch and Work is a really cool feature. If you click Watch and Work (in the lower right corner) the application shrinks down and is placed in the upper left corner sort of out of the way. I say sort of because it is always on top and on my screen I am not able to get Lightroom completely visible. I can't find a minimize button so I have to go back to standard mode and then minimize it. But it does work and is a quick way to get the video up while I am working. (It's probably time I get another monitor...) The DVD does come with samples but I have no problem following along using my own photos.\n\nWhile the lessons themselves are great I did find a few quirks.\n\nWhen you first put in the disc Windows 7 pops up suggesting to run Start.exe. Choosing that starts the video with an intro from the two authors but there is no mention how to use the program. Fortunately there is a Table of Content in the upper left corner which is how I actually go through this. It isn't terribly difficult to use the video but it would make for a smoother and less timely start if they went over the use of it. The booklet does explain a little but not completely which goes for the help screen as well.\n\nThere is no install for the DVD. DVDs are either watched once or used for installation. Since I will use this as a reference and it will be used over and over they should have included an install so that you will always have access to the video. You can copy the entire DVD to your hard drive and setup a shortcut but for a lot of users that isn't always easy to do.\n\nRight away I found an annoying orange menu that pops up even if I slightly bump the mouse. All it has are options for Full Screen or an info sidebar. These options are also available in the lower right corner. At first I wasn't sure if it was part their screen shots or the application on my computer. I have not yet found any info that explains this or how to turn it off and I have no use for this menu - strictly annoying.\n\nAnother annoyance is when you close the application it goes through the list, or credits, of who put it together. Why? My experience as a developer is that no one cares who created it; if it's good people will use it. But we get to see them every single time.\nTip: although it is an added step after you click the close button, click again and you won't have to wait through the credits.\n\nThe package comes with a booklet but it doesn't offer much. Half of it explains photography and how to take certain shots. If you are using Lightroom chances are you probably have several photography books already. Another section briefly goes through each of the new features in 3. And there is a section that shows the specific settings for certain screens and another section on the shortcuts. The booklet is not an alternative to learning the application but may be a handy reference for some.\n\nThe begin where you left off doesn't work for me in fact it suggested something I used yesterday.\n\nBut I really do look forward to learning Lightroom with this video. It is far better than the free ones I have found online. And it even helps me with 2.7. Once installed on my hard drive it works great as a quick reference. I am still debating on upgrading Lightroom at least right away. But this video made several features really clear that I otherwise might not have used. And while it does have a hefty price tag my benefits are worth the expense.", "label": 1}

This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.\n\nRoxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to \"encourage\" (read \"browbeat\") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.\n\nIt is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting \"Illegal Request\" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that \"EASY\" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.\n\nI now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do \"drag and drop\" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.\n\nIt shouldn't be called \"EASY CD Creator\". Perhaps \"IRRITATING\" CD Creator would be more appropriate.\n\nIn Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few \"BLACK HOLES\"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Well, maybe this works for you if you have DSL or a T1 or something, but I have dial-up and this program is driving me crazy.  It keeps dialing up every couple of hours.  The only way I have found to stop this is to turn off the computer.  I have spent hours emailing tech support and trying every solution, to no avail.  I turned off all the automatic updates, changed my DUN settings, even uninstalled and reinstalled DUN, which let me tell you was a pain and a half because I had to re-enter all my settings.  Half the time tech support doesn't read my email carefully, which was nothing new after dealing with Symantec.  But at least Norton products and even Microsoft can figure out when I'm online and when I'm not, and not dial the phone without my knowing it, tying up my phone lines for hours for no good reason.  And unlike a previous reviewer, my Norton Antivirus and Internet Security both updated themselves as far as program updates, not to mention viruses.  I just got tired of Norton jacking up its subscription prices, not to mention the big foot print others mentioned.  I'd love to stick with ZoneAlarm if I could get it to behave.  The reason it does this dialing is that instead of NIS which downloads URL and virus updates, ZoneAlarm actively checks URLs against a database on its server while you are online.  Apparently they haven't figured out a way to make ZA check and see if you are online before it starts connecting.  Also, since I have automatic virus updates turned off, when I want to update them, I have to enter my security password.  This is fine for me, but another reason I got this was to prevent other users from surfing inappropriate websites.  So that means only I can update virus definitions.  If you're a parent and you want this for your kids' computer, that means you have to get on and update it yourself.  Does this sound convenient?  I'm ready to kick the whole thing out and go back to sloppy bloated Norton.  At least it did what it was supposed to do, and when.", "label": 2}

I had been using PowerPoint but had gotten extremely frustrated with its lack of versatility.  When I looked into my options I first tried some open source products that were free.  On the surface they appeared to be very applicable, but as I used them I quickly ran into bugs and realized that I needed something tried and true that had people that stood behind it so I could call when or if I had an issue.  So I downloaded the free trial of SmartDraw.  I tried it out for about a half an hour and liked it so much I bought it.  This was exactly the product I had been looking for.\n\nImmediately I found the interface intuitive to use.  It felt like a weight had been lifted from my back.

{"text": "Pros: contains every page of every issue since the birth of this great magazine until 2009. Not just the texts, but photos, and even advertisements (granted that earlier issues from 1880's were free of photos).  It will take you a long time to read them all.  All for a reasonable price of ~$70\n\nCons:\n\n1. The curse of software is that as soon as it comes out, it is obsolete.  And in the case of the CNG, regular updates only improves the software, but not the data because it ends in 2008.  It remains unknown if they will release incremental additional discs that start in 2009.  More often than not, companies release only the complete version that always starts from the beginning, frustrating early collectors.  But we won't know the answer until at lease a decade later, and by then, DVDs are probably no more useful than 8-tracks.\n\n2. NGM is known for its awesome photos.  However, in the digital version, all pages are scanned with sub-par qualities.  When viewed at 100%, there are annoying artifacts around texts and the photos are posterized.  Also the resolution is too low, especially on these map inserts, small fonts are almost unintelligible.\n\n3. Every page is a picture, making it impossible to copy and paste, and thus you will have to live with the compression artifacts, and are unable to do things like copying and pasting to a word processor to view it with real fonts.\n\n4. The software framework is not every intuitive. It has a lot of features, but no documentation on how to use them. So all I do is browse by year/browse issues and read each issue from the first page to the last, just like I do a real magazine.\n\n5. The software is poorly built. The software frequently screws up.  When you switch from one issue to another, it frequently fails to load the new one and shows a blank screen.  You will have to restart the software.\n\nSo it could've been done better, and I would be more than happy to pay double the price if they doubled the resolution and the number of discs.

{"text": "I used a previous version of GoBack on a Windows 98 machine, and it worked as promised, saving my kiester on a few occasions. So when I saw GoBack 3 claimed compatability with XP, I bought it, thinking it would give me better security.\nThink again! It seemed to install OK, so I went online to register. Roxio's website said I should download their free update, which I dutifully did, and installed. Then, when I re-booted, the computer stalled on the first black screen with a disk read error message. After trying every trick I know, I realized that my only hope of saving my precious data was to put a new hard drive in the computer, install XP on it, and then try to recover my data. $... later, I found to my dismay that even though both of my old drives showed up in BIOS, Windows couldn't see either one! A very knowledgable computer tech at a local store rolled his eyes when I described the problem, and said that they don't even try to recover data from drives messed up by GoBack. His only suggestion was to try Partition Magic ($...) to recover the data. Long story short, it worked, but I had to harvest all the data, and re-format my old drives to remove the last vestages of GoBack, and then re-build my software environment from scratch.\nThis software has cost me over $... and many hours of my time.\nDON'T USE IT WITH WINDOWS XP!", "label": 0}
{"text": "Had a chance to try this out, here are a few impressions:\n\nEasy to use, well-designed, and useful.\n\nBUT... at a fairly basic \"this is Lightroom\" level.  So, if you're new to Lightroom, and a visual learner (as opposed to wanting to read everything in a book), this is an awesome resource.  It's kind of like having an experienced photographer friend sit down with you and a copy of LR3 for 10 hours and go over every feature, in a reasonable degree of depth, one feature at a time.  But you get to pause, rewind, and rewatch it whenever you want, add bookmarks to favorite parts you want to review later, etc.\n\nYou can also learn LR3 on your own; that's what I did.  I'd been using the program for over a year before getting this, so I didn't think I had much to learn.  While I wasn't sure how useful this would be, I was pleasantly surprised.  I use primarily the Library and Develop modules (all the time), and was hoping to learn more about the other three (Print, Web, and Slideshow).  I certainly did, and am comfortable with those now.  But I also learned some pretty useful things about the ones I use constantly (I haven't really used collections before, for instance, and that's going to be a huge time-saver).\n\nThe two photographers that guide you through lightroom introduce you to all of its features, but don't necessarily give too much creative input... they teach you what you CAN do, not what TO do.  For most people, this is fine.  But they're not there to refine and hone your creativity.  Just get you familiar with the program, which they do very well.\n\nWhat I'm a little disappointed by is that I didn't get&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Learn-Adobe-Photoshop-CS5-by-Video-Core-Training-in-Visual-Communication-Learn-by-Video/dp/0321719808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Learn Adobe Photoshop CS5 by Video: Core Training in Visual Communication (Learn by Video)</a>&nbsp;instead.  I don't know Photoshop nearly as well as I know Lightroom.  And while Lightroom isn't too hard to figure out without a guide, Photoshop is pretty much impossible.  And that particular video item, while the same price as this, has over twice as much video (21 hours instead of 10).  If you're trying to learn both programs, I'd probably recommend getting that instead, and figuring out LR3 on your own.\n\nOh, and it comes with a book.  The book is a little odd, as it doesn't really go along with the product.  Instead, it has three main sections:  The first, is basically a \"welcome to photography, here's what you need to know to capture nice images\" with basic photographic advice.  Part 2 is \"what's new in LR3\" (compared to previous versions; only newly added stuff is mentioned).  The third part is Lightroom preferences... basically, descriptions of everything that you can tweak \"under the hood\".  I read them, and they're all okay... but they're not what you're buying this product for.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I've been using Final Draft since version 6, and I will say I am happy with the changes they made to 7.\n\nThe controls are very intuitive. I actually spend more of my time going from rough draft to first draft paring down the dialogue because it really is so simple to enter. The auto-complete function coupled with the ability to quickly enter two person dialogue (simply hitting tab will set up a new character's dialogue line,) really does save an incredible amount of time.\n\nThe notecard function helps me a great deal during the beginning stages of writing a script. Script ideas can quickly and easily be jotted down and saved. It saves me a lot of desk space which was before saved for countless Post-Its.\n\nThe script reading function is a neat little added function. It isn't a substitute for having live actors read through it, but being able to hear the words out loud does come in handy.\n\nEarlier versions of FD7 were a bit buggy, but the latest version build does seem to run a lot smoother.\n\nThere's an option for stageplays but, to be honest, I'd stick with a regular word processor. It takes WAY too much time to correct the default formating to make it worth your while.\n\nI am still quite frustrated with the activation/deactivation convention Final Draft has decided to use.\n\nWhen you purchase a software license, you are allowed to activate Final Draft on 2 computers. I only used one and was going on my merry way when the hard drive crashed. I, mistakenly it turns out, went ahead and just used the second activation.\n\nThe hard drive is older, so it does give me problems sometimes. When the PC crashed again, I had to call customer support and have them release the customer number so I could reactivate my license.\n\nI needed to do it again just recently, and was lectured on the phone by person at tech support about how he could only give me one more \"freebie,\" and that next time he would have to charge me $99. I'm sorry, but buying version 6 and then upgrading to version 7 cost me over $300. Being able to login to an account and freeing up activations needs to be implemented.\n\nAll in all, this is a very good program for what it's built to do: write screenplays.

{"text": "I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person).  Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\n\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n\nI think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the \"list price\" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.\n\nBy the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the \"free updates\" are only good through the end of December.", "label": 0}

{"text": "It has been 10 years since the new versions of office documents (docx, pptx etc) were introduced.  For better or worse, Ribbon interface is here to stay.  Is there something new that Microsoft can bring to the table?\n\nI write as a sole proprietor who has been using Office 365 Enterprise for half a year.  I installed Office 2013 RTM (i.e. final version) about a month earlier than the official release in late January 2013.  My review will answer 1) why and who should upgrade to Office 2013 and 2) which version (Home & Business, Pro, Office 365 Home Premium, Small Business or Enterprise) to choose.\n\nFor Q1 (who should and why upgrade), my short answer is: upgrade if you are: a) using a touch computer; b) you own several computers and use all of them to edit the same documents; c) you are running on a slow computer and wants some extra speed.  Otherwise there is no need to upgrade from 2007/2010.  2003 users will have to decide whether they want to make the switch to Ribbon.\n\n1A - Using a touch computer\nI own a Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, a Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Office 2013 automatically recognizes the touchscreen and increases the spacing between icons for me.  Frankly the increased spacing is not much use on my 11.6 inch display as mis-clicks are still frequent.  I still resort to the built-in pen for clicking the small icons (Save, undo etc).\n\nMore importantly, the new version supports gestures such as pinch to zoom and flicking the screen to scroll.  This, together with Windows 8 Pro, make touch experience almost bearable on a PC.\n\nOf course, to truly take advantage of Office 2013's touch function, you also need Windows 8.  The on-screen keyboard in Windows 8 is simply better than the one in Windows 7.  The most important improvement is the maximize icon next to the X button of the keyboard.  Press it, and the keyboard becomes \"one with the taskbar\".  The app will not occupy the space beneath the keyboard and make itself inaccessible (because the keyboard floats above it).\n\nWord now supports a Reader mode, which is HUGELY useful and makes me want to convert all my ePub to word documents.  The idea is simple: Word reflows the text to single column/double columns while maintaining certain formatting like italic, fonts, highlighting etc and discarding others (tabs, line spacing for example).  This is similar to what we experience from other eReaders (Amazon Kindle, ePub readers etc).  The great thing about reading document in Word 2013 is that you can save your annotation directly on the file - there is no need to worry about syncing annotation.  Contrast this to reading ePub - each software saves its own annotation file that cannot be easily read by another software.\n\n1B - Multiple computers, one document\nHaving multiple computers is both a blessing and a curse.  Nothing beats turning off your office computer and take an early leave, knowing that whatever you failed to complete can be finished at home.  However it is a nightmare to learn that the document (or the newest version of it) is not available when you arrive at home.\n\nThere are many ways to transfer files from office to home, from the tedious (USB, manual or software assisted) to the care-free (dropbox automatic sync).  Your organization may or may not allow USB drives (for good reasons).  Dropbox requires administrative privilege which 99% of the working force do not have.  With Office 2013 you have a third option - save to your own Skydrive.  If you purchase the non-subscription version, you get 7GB space of Skydrive, Office 365 Home Premium gives you 27GB.  For the business version, storage depends on the base subscription and add-on plans.  Skydrive is like a USB stick that connects to your computer through the Internet.  You can create folders, save files, read files, delete files just as you would on a USB stick.  The difference is that it is always available as long as you have connection to the Internet.\n\nTo save to Skydrive, you must first have a Microsoft Live account.  If you have a Hotmail/outlook.com email account, you already have one.  You can also register a Live Account with any email you own (gmail Yahoo university mail).  You then login to this Live account from within Office, you only need to do it once for each computer, and you can do it in Excel/Word/etc.  After you have logged in, you can Save the document to Skydrive by pressing the icon linking to your skydrive, and you will be prompted with your Skydrive's folder structure - just as what you would see if you were to save on C drive.  To open a file, choose Open, then press the icon to your skydrive, and viola - your file is there.  A little icon called Office Upload Assistant on bottom right area next to the clock (the notification area) tells you whether all documents have been uploaded.\n\nI also like the fact that opening Word 2013 shows you a Welcome screen with built-in templates AND YOUR OWN TEMPLATES (provided they are saved in Skydrive/locally).  No longer do you need to go through layers of folders before finding the template for Invoice etc.  You can also \"pin\" your favorite templates so that they are one-click away from being created.  You can of course still create new documents from templates the way you would in 2007/2010.\n\n1C - Performance\nPerformance is BIG thing nowadays.  Finally Microsoft saw the need to reduce the footprints of its software and make them more suitable for the \"average\" machines.  It used to be the case that business machines are evaluated by how many Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can be opened simultaneously while running on Windows Vista!\n\nHaving used the RAM-eating Office 2007 and the atrociously slow Office 2010, Office 2013 breathes new life to my 4 years old Dell Latitude E4200 (running on an ultra-low voltage dual-core Penryn processor).  I used to uncheck Outlook when I re-installed Office 2007/2010 because they start up painfully slowly.  The speed of Outlook 2013 is almost tolerable (about 7 seconds).  Outlook 2013 also does not cause my notebook to stutter.\n\nThe re-sizing on Word has also been improved.  It no longer draws accurate snapshots of the document as you zoom.  Instead it \"blurs\" the document as you zoom, and after you have settled on the zoom level, it draws a final, accurate snapshot.  It may not seem much, but coming from a computer-engineering background, I suspect this reduces CPU workload (and thus energy use) significantly.\n\nSaving, opening, and switching between Ribbon tabs now feel instant even on my crappy 4 years-old laptop.  On my new Samsung tablet (sporting the newest Intel processor), starting Word is instant and outlook takes a mere 2 seconds to show.  The whole experience is very much like using an iPad, where every app loads instantaneously.\n\nNew features\nI can only comment on Word, Onenote and Outlook 2013, which I use daily.  I will let my more knowledgeable fellow reviewers comment on the rest.\n\nWord 2013\nNew features include the reader mode, touch-icons, touch gestures (mentioned above).\n\nTrack Changes is now infinitely more useful as it shows comments like a conversation.  The new Office Store allows you to install third-party apps (such as Merriam-Webster Dictionaries) to increase functionality.  You no longer need to \"hunt\" for plug-ins as you would for all previous versions.\n\nYou may or may not need the add pictures from an online location function.  The ability to embed YouTube video is also of dubious use - I prefer saving the youtube video offline, convert it and send it as an attachment to the word document.  This way my client won't ring me at 2am complaining they cannot view the clip (whether it is due to their connection to YouTube or some technical problem I do not care to solve), but this is just me.\n\nThe much-touted PDF manipulation is trash.  It seems that whatever PDF file I open using Word 2013, formatting is heavily messed up.  Apparently Microsoft tries to convert PDF to DOCX first before you can do any meaningful operation.  You are better off with a software that treats PDF as a PDF, such as the cheap but excellent PDF-XCHANGE software suites.\n\nOneNote 2013\nI could not be bothered to compare the feature sets between OneNote MX (free with Windows 8) and OneNote 2013.  It suffices to note that MX has fewer features but a more touch-centric control.\nOneNote still does not get the degree of formatting control like Word.  You cannot make multi-layered lists or format text (and change formatting) using an umbrella category (like the Body, Heading 1, Heading 2).  Still, I enjoy jotting notes with OneNote much more than with Word.  Lists just indent to the proper place EVERY SINGLE TIME and there is no need to deal with page breaks.\n\nI cannot think of any new features that are worth mentioning.  Onenote 2010 already had some sort of integration with the predecessor to Skydrive (called Live Drive).  The auto-correct still does not correct Recognise to Recognize etc (as Word 2013) does.  You can still add Online picture as you do in Word 2013.  There is also a new helper software that sits on the Taskbar and help you get screen capture quicker.  I always turn off the helper software because it adds unnecessary complexity to my taskbar.\n\nOutlook 2013\nMicrosoft has not gone enough to change Outlook 2013.  Just as 2007/2010, it is extremely difficult to change account settings such as whether to download headers only or full text (with or without attachments).  The data file (OST or PST) still reside in the elusive place of C:\\User\\(user name)\\AppData instead of your own \"My Document\" folder.  Sure you will forget to back that up as you re-install windows?  You also cannot see all emails using an \"Unified Inbox\" as you would with a 2-year old android phone/iPhone without using a script (search unified inbox vba if you really want to know)\n\nOutlook has always struggled to find a proper interface.  I still recall using Outlook 2000 and being greeted with a Today's screen which shows some of my unread emails and upcoming appointments in extremely small fonts.  Outlook 2013 is better, when you start it shows you the Inbox, and you can quickly switch to appointments/contacts from the bottom left huge icons.\n\nOne new feature is integration with Facebook/other social networks.  The idea is to merge your contacts with Facebook's contacts.  I only connected about 20% of my friends because Outlook doesn't know Charles Jeremy Moore in outlook is really Charles Moore on Facebook.  You can of course manually link them as you could in the People app in Windows 8, but I cannot be bothered.\n\nAssuming you have linked facebook contacts with Outlook, you can see a snapshot of your friend's profile while reading his email.  Useful?  I doubt it.  It is not often the case that your business associates will write something you absolutely must know business-wise (gossiping is another matter).  If there is some blogs/feeds you must read, the recommended course is to setup an RSS feed and read it regularly.  Stumbling upon someone's relationship status only distracts you from the current work.\n\nIt may or may not be a new feature, but pinning Outlook 2013 to your taskbar allows you to create tasks/appointments quickly.  Right-click the icon (not left click) and you will be greeted with a short-cut for New Appointment/Email/Contact/Task/Meeting.  What is best is that using any of the above will not launch Outlook 2013, not the whole program at least.  It is extremely handy for adding new appointments etc when you are talking on phone.  The ability to quickly add appointment from Outlook 2013 is one of the reasons I ditched Google in favour of my Office 365 Exchange account for storing calendars and contacts.  (note: Outlook 2013 cannot sync with Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync as of now, Outlook blames Google for not having the newest Exchange version).\nWARNING: do not use the New Email function from the right click menu.  After you have typed your email, it is stored at the Outbox but NOT send out.  You have to launch Outlook to send it.  I cannot understand what Microsoft is thinking...\n\n2 - Comparison\nI have been using Office 365 to host my business email address and website for half a year, so I am familiar with the subscription model.\n\nFeature-wise Office Pro and Office 365 is the same (but note the difference in Skydrive storage).  Simple math tells us that the price for Office Pro equates 4 years of Office 365.  The catch for purchasing Office Pro is that you are limited to 1 PC while Office 365 covers 5.  If you own more than 1 device, Office 365 is a no-brainer, or so it seems.\n\nThe reason why I gave Office Pro 5 stars while Office 365 Home Premium 3 stars is solely based on Price alone.  If you are a sole proprietor/small business, you are better-off with the Office 365 business plans (as I am subscribing).  If you are a Home User, as the name Home Premium suggest, I make the following assumptions: 1) your company pays for the office licence in your work computer(s) and 2) you do not have more than 1 home computer that needs Office.  Under this assumption the 5 PC advantage practically falls away.  The remaining question is whether you will upgrade in 4 years and whether the extra storage matters.\n\n4 years is a bit longer than 1 product cycle (see 2003 - 2007-2010-2013).  If you will buy/subscribe Office 2016/2017 (if there is one) when it is released, then subscribing to Home Premium will present better value.  If you will skip one product cycle (i.e. skipping 2016/2017 and purchase 2020/2021), then Office Pro is better value.  I think most home users can afford to lag behind more than 1 product cycle.  New products are not always better, often the new features are useless to a home user and the new interface just spells frustration.\n\nI think Office 365 HP is only appeal to users who match every criterion below:\n1) You need Outlook/Access/Publisher\n2) You have more than 1 computer\n3) You plan to receive the next Office as it becomes available\n4) You are not benefitted by Office 365 business versions\n\nRegarding 1) above, most home users need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only, and their needs are well served by the cheaper Home versions.  Please note that if you do not use Outlook now, you probably won't need it in the future.  It is an overkill for checking gmail etc.  Access and Publisher require you to sit down and learn, possibly taking 1 month each before you fully appreciate their use and advantage over Excel/Word.  There is no point in going for Office Pro or Office HP just to get all software and be \"future-proof\" if Office Home Student/Home Business is good enough.\n\nIf you are willing to pay so much for the extra software (Outlook/Publisher/Access), but doesn't receive a free licence from your company, chances are that you work at a SMB.  SMBs stand to benefit A LOT from Office 365 business (see below), and even though you may not implement all the features, Office 365 business is still worth considering.\n\nOffice 365 Home Premium is expensive compared with Office 365 Enterprise.  At $20/Month Office 365 Enterprise gives you all Office software, your own exchange email account, Sharepoint and Lync (basic) servers.  The website shows Office Professional Plus 2010, but you can download Office 2013 RTM from TechNet and use your Office 365 login name to get the software running.  That was how I got Office 2013 a month earlier than the general public.\n\nI wish only to add that regardless of whether you use Office 365 HP or Office 365 Ent, Office Web App is trash.  The idea of being able to edit document from a web-browser (running on an iPad maybe) is attractive, but unrealistic.  The reasons are: 1) Web App only supports DocX etc formats, but not the old formats; 2) more importantly, formatting is often MESSED UP when you use Web App.\n\nMore coming: the benefit of having your own exchange account and more importantly sharepoint server (in the coming week) and why it is much better value to sole proprietor/small business.", "label": 2}

{"text": "A few years ago, when designing 2 rooms at my office, I became fluent in most of the off-the-shelf, under $100 design programs.  I recall switching between 2 applications that each had great features, and would have made a perfect product if merged.  One was 3D Home Architect 3, the other (which I can't recall the name) had some similarities to Home Designer 6.  Having just tried 3D Home Architect 5 & Home Designer 6, I still have the same feeling: each has very strong & very weak points.\nHaving now sampled both applications, I can't seem to figure how so many people posted hate for 3DHA.  I think it's a tie between the two.\nMy big criticism w/ HD6 is that you cannot manually change wall dimensions.  It was incredibly tedious to recreate rooms based on the dimensions I had.  Apparently, the pro version ($500) allows this function, but I wasn't going to pay that for my little project.  When you click a wall you've created in 3DHA, it displays measurements to every other nearby wall.  You then can click any of those measurements to resize it manually.  This is the absolute most logical way to get exact measurements.\nIn HD6, the library of items is pretty skimpy compared to 3DHA.  3DHA easily allows custom items to show in the 'library' so it's easy to reuse them.\nAs for the 3D rendering, 3DHA really sucks.  It is incredibly difficult to get the camera view into custom positions.  This is where HD6 is best.  You can arrange multiple cameras in your layout, each corresponding to another rendered window.  You can also double-click the camera in the layout & it brings up other view settings such as height & field of vision angle.\nAs for working w/ your layout, 3DHA allows you to drag a selection tool over multiple items, creating a multiple selection.  You can then move all of those items at once, or select their properties.  For changing the color of multiple items, this is great.  HD6 does not allow you to select multiple items & then change characteristics of them.  Imagine having a room you want to change the color of all of the cabinets.  According to my findings, in HD6 you'd have to change each cabinet one by one.  In 3DHA you would just hold the shift key & select all of the cabinets, then make your changes.\nMaybe I'm asking for too much from <$100 programs, but it sure seems both programs make it much harder to do things then they have to.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I have been a loyal Quicken upgrader for years, and I find myself frustrated with every upgrade.  First of all, they don't give you much of a deal on upgrades for being a loyal customer.  Check out MS Money 2002 Deluxe.  (...)\nMissing features:  Does not handle exchange-traded options at all.  Only handles employee stock options in a rudimentary way.  Help files are terribly incomplete with some \"features\" not documented at all.  Unlike almost every other Windows program, in Quicken you can only look at one window at a time, so it is very difficult to compare one register to another.  Unfortunately, the program consumes memory as though every window in the Quick Tabs section is open, but the program doesn't update them until you click on them.  The program is slow, slow, slow even on a fast machine, and it gets worse as the data files get larger.  The reports and graphs section is so inflexible as to be almost comical.  There is no \"Undo\" command, and once you've entered something, it is automatically saved and becomes a permanent part of your file.  In other words, you can't even \"quit without saving\" as an \"Undo\" command.  Feel free to put in all of the feature requests you want to at the Quicken tech support web site, but they will ignore them all.\nBugs:  This company has no concept of testing before shipping a product.  The program can corrupt your data in such a way that the Validate and Super Validate functions can't catch it - much less correct it.  When you finally do discover it, you can't restore just a piece from back up - it's all or nothing.  I back up after every session, but even so, in my case, this meant a choice between re-entering weeks of data or just living with the missing (corrupted) data.  Tech support, if you can call it that, is of very little use, and they are expensive.  The program arbitrarily fails to download your data over the Internet for days at a time, but tech support has no clue how to fix it.  The program quietly does automatic program updates which change the way certain parts work, so now my scroll button only works in about half of the windows where it used to work, and the Enter key now functions ever so slightly differently when entering data.  Sometimes the program just crashes right in the middle of an operation.  Did it complete what I was doing?  Did it go back to the last fully completed operation?  Did it corrupt some portion of my data file that I won't notice for weeks?  There is no way to know.  Feel free to put in all of the bug fix requests you want to at the Quicken tech support web site, but they will ignore them all - upgrade after upgrade.\nThis program is probably fine if you just use it to track your checkbook and follow some simple investments.", "label": 0}

For example, it seems to require a password for everyone to logon to. There may have been a way to access sites w/out having to type each one in, but I couldn't figure it out. Under WinME, it caused a consistent page fault in Netscape 6.2 in some DLL that I'd never even heard of. The problem magically went away when I uninstalled Net Nanny.\nHave switched to Cybersitter and recommend it over Net Nanny. CyberSitter is unobtrusive; the only person asked for a password is the administrator when they double-click the program in the quick start tray. Screen layouts are intuitive, something lacking in so many products, and the product is stable with lots of configuration options. For example, you can eliminate porn but still get into hunting or other politically incorrect sites. Unfortunately Cybersitter has stupid problems of its own: 1) it \"catches\" way too many legitimate sites. In fact, I've had to put just about every site I use regularly in its 'acceptable sites' list.  2) You have no control over what phrases it is monitoring, and it monitors legitimate words and phrases. This is VERY annoying. 3) Its method of parsing causes a lot of DLL crashes in Netscape and IE.  4) Cybersitter also tends to time out on newsreaders because it is getting stuck when filtering porn spams.  You cannot filter only certain newsgroups; it's all or nothing.\nDespite these maddening problems, Cybersitter is the best of a bad lot.

{"text": "Despite mixed reviews, I bought FP2002 mainly because HoTMeTaL had just become unavailable. I'm a heavy and long-term user of Office products, and am entirely comfortable with them. Purpose of this purchase was to draft look/feel and content of a new web site, which I would hand over to a professional designer for tweaking.\nTook a very reasonable couple of weeks' effort making what I wanted. Two major issues were unexpected non-ease of importing formatted material from Office, and weird instability in text/graphics positioning: stuff jumps all over the place w/o warning. (I'm running WinXP Home, in case it matters.)\nThen passed the saved files to a pro running DreamWeaver on Mac. He is completely unable to open many, and others all seem to have a bunch of Java in the HTML code. (Yes, I did turn off all those unneeded options first.) It doesn't seem to be possible to save as simple HTML files with common code.\nIt's going to cost me a great deal of time and money to repeat the whole exercise from scratch. Wish MS hadn't dropped their 30-day free trial, but I can see why.\nRight for some, no doubt. But if you want compatible code, portable files, or any real idea of what's going on in there (a familiar story with MS?), run away fast.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Instant Immersion Spanish is a good place to start learning Spanish.  The cost alone makes it a nearly risk free purchase.  Will it make you fluent?  No it won't, but I'm seeing it for a 'low' price with free shipping.  What have you got to lose?  I can't comment on how it compares to Rosetta  Stone,  but just their Level 1 alone is 5 x the $'s.\nThe program CD's focus on teaching words and basic phrases, these are OK, but really don't get too in depth with what you need to know to really learn Spanish.  The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk.  This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish.  There isn't any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price.\nThe \"Who is Oscar Lake\" CD game is really lame.  They could have just omitted it.  As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part.  The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90's.  I really didn't get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere.  There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years.  I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.

My machine is a Santa Rosa Intel 15\" Macbook Pro running OSX 10.5 Leopard with 2 GB of memory.\n\nFirst off I'd like to point out that this is pretty much the same exact copy of Topic Entertainment's American Sign Language Deluxe as the other listings on Amazon. All of the copies are both Windows and Mac format, all on the same discs.\n\nAfter copying the application to my local drive and running it, I would get a series of repeating errors, that would eventually lead to the application crashing. I sent in an email to Topic Entertainment's support group. Their response was that their title was only written with the intent of it only running on the system requirements printed on the box which is OSX 10.1 on a G4, and there were no plans to release an update for Leopard. They offered to return my copy for a refund if I wished.\n\nNot wanting to take no as an answer, I fired up Windows XP SP2 through VMware Fusion and attempted to install the software. Worked like a charm, videos are just as crisp as I'd expect them running natively on the Mac and disc swapping works correctly. There was an error during the installation about my copy of Quicktime being newer then the version required and asked me to first uninstall it before restarting the ASL Deluxe installation, I clicked ok and the installation continued on as normal.\n\nI should also note that I've gone through and created ISO disc images of all eight discs through Windows and am storing them locally on my drive so I don't have to lug around all of the discs at once. This works fine, VMware Fusion mounts ISO images without a problem.\n\nThe software its self is a little clunky. The first disc offers some written words about ASL. What you're buying is on the rest of the discs, a vast video library of others showing you words or phrases. I haven't played with it much past that, there are some games I haven't touched.\n\nI'll update this review when I've had more of a chance to play with the software, but for now I wanted to throw up the issues I had installing under 10.5.", "label": 2}

This was very frustrating to find that all the hard sleuthing work would turn up nothing. I dislike having to go to walkthroughs for solutions, but even worse is reading the solution and finding that the writer doesn't know why that's the solution either, it's just simply the way the game works.

{"text": "If you are thinking about purchasing Office 365 so that you can turn your iPad into a serviceable work station, think again. The apps for iPad simply DO NOT WORK.\n\nAbout one month after purchasing a year's subscription to Office 365, the \"share\" feature stopped working. This means I can't email or provide links to any of the documents I create on my iPad-- which pretty much makes the whole app worthless. Normally, I would have simply contacted a tech support representative and had the problem resolved that next day. That's what I've done with Apple and Amazon. Even smaller online companies I've done business with have a quick and easy chat service that allows them to solve problems quickly. A company's accessibility says as much about its confidence in its product as the performance of the product, itself: if they've got nothing to hide and are truly committed to offering their customers the best possible experience, there's no reason for them NOT to be accessible.\n\nSo you can imagine my dismay when I discovered that microsoft tech support is totally and completely inaccessible. After searching the app's \"help\" feature with absolutely no success, after languishing on hold to chat with an online representative that wound up being outsourced and clueless, after digging through the FAQs, forums, and articles to no avail, I came to the sorry conclusion that I could not contact microsoft because it did not want to be found. This is a perfect example of a company that knew it was hawking garbage and, after having flung its refuse in my face, slipped gleefully into the shroud of the inter-web-- never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nIn short: Office 365 for iPad is a scam.\n\nI tried to delete and reload the apps with no success. I tried to work directly in word online with no success. I tried saving the documents to the onedrive and directly to the iPad with no success. Copy and pasting what I've written into the body of an email undoes all of the formatting, and is therefore not a viable option. And before microsoft sends one of its cronies to comment on my review: YES. I have absolutely provided the company with a direct comment/feedback on this situation. I provided it nearly two months ago and have seen absolutely no change since.\n\nSo, in utter desperation, I've been downloading all of the updates for the office apps as soon as they become available, hoping that one of them would finally solve the \"share\" problem for iPad. But instead of improving the apps, the update has only made them worse. Today's update completely got rid of the \"word count\" feature-- a very basic feature that I rely on to do my job-- and replaced it with some tool that allows me to see the document as a full page instead of the traditional view (... wth?). Now when I search \"word count,\" the help feature swears it doesn't exist, never existed. And I don't have an extra hour to spend trying to communicate with an outsource technician. So today is exactly the day that I decided to stop being nice and write this review.\n\nWhat we have in microsoft is a company so bloated and monopolized that it no longer cares about the woefully shoddy quality of its products, a company that has sold out to join the scam artist conglomerate of comcast and at&t. It's as if microsoft has a whole separate \"Ways to Piss Off Our Customers Thinktank\" department. I swear it does, because there's no possible way it could be more annoying, inefficient, and downright incompetent.\n\nI know there was a lot of ranting in this review, but the takeaway should be this: if you're wanting to work on your iPad, look elsewhere. The Office 365 apps for iPad are buggy and disappointing, and I have zero confidence in microsoft to fix them anytime this decade.", "label": 0}

This version of Office is installed on my laptop running Windows 8 and installation was simple and pain free. Now using the Office suite is somewhat different. There is a slight learning curve for the new menu's and features, but don't worry it isn't anything too mind-boggling. I really only use MS Word, and occasionally PowerPoint, so I cannot comment on the other programs. I don't think I will be buying another subscription Office suite after this expires. I will only buy software to own and install at my discretion. MS Office is the gold standard of office suites, and it really does work great. I am taking 1 star off because of the subscription model.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Adobe Premiere Elements 11 is difficult for a first-time user. Reading through the manual did not give me the push I needed to start editing my own footage. But Chad Perkins, the voice on this Learn by Video CD, gave me the knowledge and the motivation I needed to start experimenting with some of my own footage on the Timeline. His examples and explanations clarified what for me were difficult problems.\n\nExperienced film editors will probably not need this video; people new to film editing and the Adobe program will greatly benefit from it though. The actual creation of short, coherent movies from multiple clips in the video is a teaching technique that registers: I picked up some difficult concepts quickly because of this.\n\nChad Perkins the host is intelligent and personable. His knowledge and subtle sense of humor made the many hours of teaching fly by fast. However, one viewing will not be enough.

{"text": "Ok, folks.\n\nThere's something truly wrong with the GoBack scene. Among the planted fake reviews, are some truly pleased people. On my old Win2000 machine, I was one. It ate YukkyWare by rolling back to before it existed. Done right, that's an amazing thing.\n\nI investigate some software options for my company. LUCKILY I bought GoBack with my OWN credit card, and decided to install it on a test basis in privacy. Norton doesn't install. \"Needs this much contiguous space.\" Ok, I ran Start/Programs/Acessories/System Tools/Defragmenter TWICE.\n\nGoBack decides this is enough, and installs.\n\nBOOM! I too, met the dreaded BlackScreen. 6 Month old XP machine with basically nothing wrong. Unbelievable. The Downloaded version doesn't have a manual readily available (!) , so I had to get lucky to first disable,  followed by Last Good Configuration, and then uninstall GoBack, with two reboots. Scary. I chose not to recommend this to my boss. :/\n\nI called Symantec (after wasting an hour with their information screen and technique of hiding support numbers.) Rep tells me \"maybe your hard drive has problems.\" (You mean BEFORE, or AFTER installing GoBack?) Enough of Symantec Tech.\n\nSo I turn off System restore, turn off 3/4 of the preloads, disable Norton Internet and Norton AntiVirus, and try again. Same BlackScreen. Disable GoBack, Last Good Configuration, Uninstall GoBack. Tried to look at the invoice I saved. The webpage contains Java elements. Internet explorer crashed so hard \"End Now\" ... didn't end it. Rebooted Windows.\n\nRight. I damn nearly annihilated my work computer. (I'd love to explain that one!)\n\nSo I get this brilliant idea. \"Look! Since I nearly ruined my work computer, maybe it will work at home!!!!\" Drumroll....\n\n... Which it does. << Smacks Forehead >>\n\nThis is too much. So I went reseaching. See the amazon reviews. Someone BlackScreened on Win XP1, so it's not the infamous Destruction Pack 2. Someone reported a problem at the Bios level. (GoBack conflicts with OEM Bios installs?? GREAT.)\n\nSomeone else mentioned Dell. The comp I nearly blew up was a dell. It works on an E-Machine.\n\nNetwork Connections? RAID drives? Wireless networks? Dell Proprietary software at the setup level? I don't have a $100,000 budget to do the research report with. Symantec seemed unimpressed when Windows wouldn't boot. (Isn't that what usually gets a supervisor involved?)\n\nResult is, when this thing works, it's really incredible.\n\n\"Said Medicine makes you impervious to Earthquakes, Floods, and Fires. Side effects include Coma.\"\n\nIf you're brave and you get lucky, fine. If not, there's something in Windows XP and/or Version 4.0 that annihilates 60% of computers. So what's the average temperature between the interior of the Sun and Absolute Zero? 3 Stars.\n\n--TaoPhoenix", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used.  I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\n\nThis 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\n\nOther than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\n\nFor most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\n\nAnother thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\n\nMost likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.", "label": 2}

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen.

{"text": "I've taken classes, read books and did the dummies books but can't seem to learn Dreamweaver well enough to design a web site the way I want. I had really hoped that this dvd video that is \"Adobe Approved\" would have helped, but it fell short. First off I do want to give kudos for the way the software interface is designed. They made it very easy to navigate and find specific contents and general ease. Candyce Mairs, the teacher, gives excellent explanations and speaks clearly and at a good pace. The pace isn't too fast or too slow and I never had to rewind to listen to instructions over and over.\n\nThe course begins with the absolute basics so this is where it really breaks everything down about Dreamweaver. Being I knew most of the basics, after an hour, skipped some of it because I already knew it. The first problem I have with this training video is that you are taught to design websites from 1990. The look of them is so out dated and old its a waste of time learning it this way because anyone wanting to design a web site would not want one that looks so out dated and blah. When the videos finally get around to showing the \"CSS\" style designing, they show an example of a web site that is current in design and style. Exactly what I was wanting to learn but they don't use it for the training...WHAT? are they joking? They go back to the 1990 styled site that they show you in the beginning of these videos and TRY to update and revamp it into CSS. I wanted to focus on the CSS portion because for my needs, this is the missing info that has held me back on finally learning and make a modern web site using Dreamweaver.\n\nThe sample that they should have used to teach the CSS had many bells and whistles like when you scroll thru the site the background didn't move. The background was a great illustration photo! Then there were great drop down sub nav links that all had different colors, maps, columns, video etc. Again, all the modern bells and whistles. Yes, they do teach many of these features but in the OLD 1990 style, not in the CSS which is a complete different way of putting things into the program. I really wish they used the sample which they showed about how great CSS is. TOTAL BUMMER!!!!\n\nI have plenty of experience with web design, i'm no expert but have worked with many programs over the years as well as designed many custom sites that look modern. But unfortunately, I still am on the search to find the info I need to use Dreamweaver the way I want.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The \"Learn by Video\" program for Flash CS5 would make a nice alternative to an introductory book - especially for visual learners.  I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.\n\nThere are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\n\nThe focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\n\nOverall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on \"Best Practices\" serves as a useful complement to the \"how to\" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.", "label": 1}

In all honesty I could care less to learn how to write in the language as I am in learning how to speak it. I was taught how to speak in English by first learning the alphabet and knowing how each letter sounds, not by a picture of a car and writing \"car\" above it then saying the word. I had to sound out every letter in the word before I was allowed to say the word. Rosetta Stone never teaches you the alphabet, nor how to \"sound it out\", for the life of me I can't seem to say a single word in Spanish because I have now idea how to sound it out. I see a word written in the Spanish and I know what it means but I couldn't say it. Rosetta Stone says that it does not use \"word recognition\" as a means of learning, but to me it sounds a lot like it. Of course that's just my style of learning, if you learn better using \"word recognition\" then this is an excellent package, but if you learn by \"phonics\" as I do then try something else.", "label": 2}

{"text": "OK, let me first admit my ignorance when it comes to such material. I don't know a hyperlink from a hyperkid and will probably never learn. I bought this product because of its glowing recommendations and more specifically for its claim that this product is for beginners as well. Well, forget that. This is undoubtedly a godsend for the design software literate, but as a beginner, I struggled. I felt like the poor slobs on Saturday Night Live when the computer geek is trying to explain to them what's wrong with their computers and they just don't get it. For instance, in one section they tell you to choose a \"theme\" from the pulldown list. I didn't like any of the template backgrounds, but they were not very clear as to how you can incorporate your own. Do they allow your own design? I'm sure they do, but as a beginner, it wasn't made clear at what point in the process you could do so. I saved and exited numerous times out of frustration, promising to come back again after reading more of the manual. Here's a sample of the directions on page 23 of the manual. Hold on you beginners our there . . . \"If you want to use the auto linking feature, enter @*(the word you want to replace)in the Replace text box and the URL in the With text box. Example: \"@Namo*\" => \"[...]\" (if you enter \"@Namo\" appears with the hyperlinks whose URL is \"[...]\".)\"  Did you get that?  Again, I don't doubt the wonderment of this product, I really don't. I respect the expert reviews out there that shower this product with accolades, but if this is for beginners then I am even more \"lame\" than my teenage daughter thinks I am. I will probably go to a web site designer and pay $100 to $200 to get me up and running.

{"text": "This product packages scans of the smaller scale, 1:500,000 and 1:100,000 USGS maps for all 48 contiguous states and 1:250,000 for Alaska and Hawaii on 17 CDs.  It takes its user interface from the hiker oriented National Geographic state series. While probably fine for planning hiking trips on the state series 1:24,000 scale maps, the program offers little in the way of tools that would be useful to a back-roads explorer.\nThe main value it does offer is in providing reasonably detailed topographic maps for the entire 50 states at a very fair price. Though that has its quirks, the program makes it fairly easy to navigate the maps. One quirk is that to get to Alaska and Hawaii, you press the \"Information and Help\" toolbar button, select \"Start with a new map\", press \"GO\", then click on the state you want, you will then be prompted to load the CD.\nThe 17 CDs are only a minor inconvenience in most cases.  Each CD contains 2 or more states, so the state you want you only really have to deal with one CD once you've installed the software.  More conveniently, you can copy some or all of them to your hard drive assuming you have about 8G free. The program allows you to configure both where you install it and where it should look for maps.\nBeyond the basic maps, the purpose I wanted it for was route planning when \"exploring back roads\" and here is falls down.  Yes you can do it but you have to do it free hand and the input method makes this tedious at best.  Once you have done all that work, the end result is not particularly useful.  The basic problem is that the routing tool is not in anyway linked the road overlay.  Consequently you cannot get a list of route instructions from it.  Another problem is that while it shows lots of roads, the road data is very basic.  Very disappointing overall.\nSo if you like maps and are looking for a relatively inexpensive way to obtain and store the 1:100,000 USGS topo maps for the entire 50 states this is probably a very good value.  It's fun to poke around the maps just to see what's there.\nIf you are a hiker then you should go straight the NG State series and buy the state you need. The scale of the maps here are too small to be much use for hikers except for very general planning.\nFor backroad exploring, I think you are better off with an already printed map book like DeLorme or Benchmark assuming it is available for your state.  It you want backroad route planning software, this is not it.", "label": 2}

You load the disc and install it from there. When that's done, you activate it with the included serial number and then it scans your device and downloads any needed updates. Just to mention it, I already had a different brand of driver updater installed and scanned my systems with that one before installing Driver Max. My old program didn't find anything that needed updating. Then I installed Driver Max and found 7 updates needed on 1 laptop, 3 on another and 1 on another. {I have 3 laptops and, it installed on all 3 with the included serial number. Seems to be a whole house use serial number}. Like I said, it's really impressive and it's the best I've ever used. The interface is really clean.

For users who might have stuck with version 2000, 2001 or 2002 of Works Suite, this will suite you more. The collection of software included is amazing for the value at which it is being offered. From power and easy to use Word Processing solutions such as Microsoft Word and quality photo-editing with Picture It! this is recommend set of programs for the home user and some businesses who need only the essentials. The package includes Works 7.0 which was also in Works Suite 2003, with basic spreadsheet and database applications. You also get great money management solution, Money 2004 makes it sinch to keep your budget on track and in tact. With its online itegration you can pay bills online or get further information to better manage your financial data. These applications I still consider not be strong enough as Microsoft Excel and Access. The database in Works approach to creating quiries is limited and unreliable. The Spreasheet does not offer the powerful calculation tools as Excel and integration between both applications is very limited. But if you need only essential tools for managing the essential aspects of your life whether at home or school Works Suite 2004 is truly a bargain.\nRemember if you are a user of Works Suite 2003, this update might be unnecessary to you because the majority of the products in version 2003 are included in version 2004.

{"text": "If you've seen neat Flash presentations and wondered how you can create them yourself, this book will get you started in the right direction.  It contains a DVD and a hundred page book supplement.  The DVD provides well-done video tutorials that you can follow along in watch-and-work mode using the starter work files included in the DVD, and the book provides useful reference materials (e.g., colored screenshots of user interfaces and how to use the various tool components, keyboard short cuts for specific tasks, etc.)\n\nThe video lessons cover all the important basics: how to create work projects and organize your files; how to use various tools and features; what are objects, shapes, symbols, movie clips, timelines, layers, frames, stage, etc; how to work with text and graphics; how to create animations such as objects moving in a choreographed fashion (motion tweens), or shapes morphing into other shapes (shape tweens); how to include ActionScript code snippets for more dynamic (but still simple) handling of events; how to build not just good-looking designs and presentations but also simple applications that react to text inputs, button presses, and mouse clicks; and how to test and deploy your work. By the time you're done with the lessons, you'll have an appreciation of how powerful Flash CS5 is and how learning even just the few techniques introduced in this video guide already empowers you to do interesting stuff!\n\nThe user interface for the video tutorials is easy to use, and although the book supplement comes with instructions on how to use that interface and navigate through the tutorials, most people should be able to figure out how to use the interface without having read those instructions first.\n\nThe video lessons are organized into eight chapters, most of which end with test questions that give you additional opportunities to revisit what you have just learned.  For the most part, the test questions quiz your knowledge of what was covered not just in the video lessons but also related materials in the book supplement; given that the video lessons and the chapters in the book supplement do not track each other perfectly (for example, the video lessons introduce motion tweens before shape tweens, but the supplement reverses this order), if you focus on the video lessons only, you might occasionally be surprised at getting quizzed on something that appeared unfamiliar by virtue of the fact that you might have missed reading some relevant materials presented (probably out of order) in the supplement.\n\nFinally, I thought that while some of the materials in the video lessons are somewhat repetitious, the instructors have nevertheless done a good job showcasing some of the most useful features of Flash. Many students will appreciate how when covering features newly available only in the latest CS5 version of Flash, the instructors clearly demonstrate how these new features improve upon the replaced \"classic\" features by illustrating how both sets of features work.", "label": 1}

Moments after installing it, I was told I needed an upgrade. After spending an unecessary amount of time getting the upgrade via online download, the problems continued. Without getting into detail, the long and short of it was that the product was not functioning as described: Images were being resized without my consent, and printed images were consistently poor in quality even when the source files were 600dpi.\n\nAfter multiple attempts to contact tech support via the website, an employee finally answered me in one of the online forums. Unfortunately, not only was the help ineffective, but his responses were few and far between. Eventually, anything I posted was ignored. In addition, users with similar issues were also ignored.\n\nI then tried contacting the company via email, and the responses were even slower. I decided to try the website once more, only to find that my IP had been banned from posting. I was furious, and decided to call the company ASAP.\n\nAfter getting the runaround, I was told QUOTE: \"my comments were not constructive to the tech support forum,\" and that, technically I was \"not a click n design customer.\" According to the person on the phone, I had purchased their software as part of a \"CD STOMPER\" package that was put together by Avery. When I told them that I was using an upgrade that Click N' Design had been given to me DIRECTLY BY STOMP via registered online download, the person on the phone claimed that I was \"really not supposed to have that version,\" and that I was \"given that version out of the goodness of their hearts\" (no lie). They then indicated that access to the tech support area of their site was banned, and that I wasn't a customer. I told them that if I was ignored, I'd be forced to contact the local office of the Better Business Bureau, and I hung up.\n\nShortly thereafter, I forwarded my concerns to the Avery corporation, as well as any corporate contacts for the Stomp, Inc. company who put out Click 'n' Design. Avery in particular was shocked and dismayed at the behavior of Stomp, Inc. After months of back and forth, the company finally decided to issue me a refund for the initial package purchase I made.\n\nIn closing, I must say that anyone and everyone should avoid this product and company. Their product was faulty, their tech support was rude and innefective, and their customer relations department was insulting and uneducated.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did, folks.", "label": 0}

{"text": "After reading all of the issues with NIS 2004, I decided to look around.  After a little searching, this program caught my eye and I decided to try it.\nMy uninstall of NIS 2003 went flawless in WinXP and the install of this trial program was smooth.  Upon the called for re-boot, I noticed something right away...My system loaded MUCH faster.  I'm talking a significant boost here folks.  A quick peek at my memory tracker, and sure enough, tons o' memory left after Pc-Cillin has fully loaded.\nSo I took my new program through all of the paces, (Shields-Up! DSL report security testing, Symantec security testing) and it passed most of the tests without much of a problem.\nHmm...I thought, this is a slick little program with not much of a memory footprint.  Could I have found the ultimate security tool?  Unfortunately, no.  But it is good enough to try it for a year (the trial version does not let you update anything, hence, you are using 4 month old virus definitions, firewall rules, etc).\nCompared straight up with Norton, here are my thoughts:\nVirus protection:  Have yet to really have any issues with Norton or Pc-cillin.  Pc-cillin scanned my entire system 10 minutes faster than Norton.\nFirewall:  Both appeared to stop the necessary attacks at all of the major website testing pages.\nCustomization:\nThis is where Pc-cillin REALLY suffers.  With NIS, you can customize how every website you visit is handled:  custom cookie handling, active-x, referrer page handling, etc.  Not with Pc-cillin.  Pc-cillin also does not offer built in ad blocking or pop-up stopping.  That is kind of annoying too.  NIS did.\nFor the parents out there, this is CRITICAL.  NIS updated restricted web-sites automatically into the program.  Pc-cillin REQUIRES the user to manually input each website you don't want shown.  Are you kidding me?!  For me, that is a real disappointment.  New pages are added every day and there is simply no way for any parent to stay on top of it.  A simple mistype from your child can result in some embarrassing, if not disgusting results.  With NIS, you were pretty well covered in the parental control arena.\nSo, overall I would call it a wash.  Pc-cillin has less memory usage, but the overall suite of products is lacking compared to NIS.  Which is probably why the load time is faster with Pc-cillin.  NIS took too much memory but it came with everything you needed.\nI will try this for a year since the Symantec people wanted $30 for another year and their support has really fallen off.", "label": 2}

The pictures are colorful and memorable and will help you learn many words quickly.\n\n2.  There is an interesting effective feature which allows you to listen to a word or phrase in Spanish, record your voice, and playback.  Then a scale tells you how close your voice came to that of a native speaker.  But I would not spend extensive time repeating the same word or phrase because it is very difficult to meet their standard for \"native speaker.\"\n\nThese are the negatives:\n\n1.  There is a great emphasis on sentences that are not practical for an adult tourist, business person, or employee wanting to speak Spanish with native speakers.  In addition, most of the sentences have verbs in the present progressive tense; there is not enough practice in all the Spanish verb tenses. There are many sentences in Spanish about boys under the table, girls walking, women waving, and men falling.\n\n2.  Because I work at a computer all day at work, I am not motiviated to sit at a computer for long during my spare time.\n\nBecause I am eager to learn useful Spanish quickly, Pimsleur is more effective for me.

{"text": "This program has some very bad data for my hometown and neighborhood. I'd be very afraid to use this program to get me someplace I didn't know, which, of course, is one of the reasons for using it.\nFor my hometown, it had the following problems:\n1. missing streets\n2. distorted and misplaced streets\n3. dirt roads and service roads marked as regular roads\n4. data on stores and restaurants was sometimes off by up to a mile\nAll of the above problems were found on roads that are at least five years old.\nA simple test of planning a route from my house to work took me down a dirt road! This is one of the very few dirt roads in town. While trying to get it to go on paved roads, it came up with some very bizarre routes. It didn't seem to know that this one major road crosses a freeway. It kept coming up with routes that would have you get on the freeway, get off at the next exit, and then double back on a surface street. Arghhh!!!! All of the major on-line mapping sites did a perfect job on this test.\nI didn't find this program to have any significant advantages over on-line mapping sites, other than speed. I didn't find the drag-n-drop feature to be very useful. All it seems to do is add stops along the route. I did like the ability to draw a square on the map and tell it to avoid routing that area. This might be useful when trying to get around some of the crazy routes it comes up with. It has seemingly no integration with Office, which would have been a significant advantage over on-line sites.\n...", "label": 0}
{"text": "I upgraded from money 2001 so I was expecting a major improvement. I was particularly interested in the automatic updates where you don't have to go to your banks website and enter your password to get your transaction data downloaded, but the data is downlaoded automatically.\n\nThat feature seems promising but as of now it DOES NOT WORK with citibank's website. There is some technical issue that  has not yet been resolved and the tech help have no knowledge of when this will to be resolved (The software is out a few weeks already).\n\nThis is surprising to me as citibank is the larget bank in the US and I wonder how many other banks a incompatible with the software?\n\nI remain unsure how to set up the automatic updates on existing accounts (accounts transferred from previous versions of money). but it is easy to set up the updates if you are setting up the acccount for the first time. There is no writtin documentation with the software and the help is too breif not providing enough detail for not-standard situations.\n\nOn the plus side the phone tech help is great, the email tech help is also pretty good. In addition there are some valuable bonuses such as money magazine and credit report monitoring  (included for free). I called the phone tech twice and the wait time is < 1 minute (for now anyway- as the software just came out).\n\nThe interface - appearance is less cluttered and neater than the 2001 version and alot of effort went in to that but the initial setup has been time consuming for me.\n\n-Of significance the auto-update uses microsoft .net passport which also puts your data on the web potentially creating a secruty issue (if you beleive your computer is more secure than microsofts servers.)\n\nIt seems that some banks may charge for the automatic update service (I don't know if microsoft puts that in to protect themself or if that is common practise I don't beleive my banks charge for that.)\n\nhopefully over the long run it will make keeping track of my finances less time consuming. ONe final point I should add is that there seems to be a heavy relaince on the web throughout the package as such someone with dial up internet service may find this very slow.-\n\nI would recommend the update but expect a hassle in setting it up.

{"text": "After reading many good reviews, I purchased this software for my 4yo who is just starting to read.  I am very disappointed in the product.\n\nFirst, it did not come with installation or use instructions.  Installation was pretty standard, so we were able to figure it out.  How to use the game, however, was not so standard.  We had to figure it out through trial and error.  It took perhaps a half hour or so, but having the instructions would have been very helpful.\n\nSecond, the software contains books for the child to read, but they are automatically read to the child.  There is no way to turn off the feature so the child can read it herself (unless I just have not found the means to do it without the instructions).\n\nNext, there is a character that has a foreign accent.  My daughter started to say the words just like that character, like \"bed\" instead of \"bad.\"  I thought this was a really bad idea for children that are learning how to sound out words.\n\nLastly, I thought the program moved really slowly.  The game is set up so that the child has to finish one area before moving on to the next.  There is so much animation mixed in with the games that it takes so long to finish one area so you can move on.  There is no way to bypass the animation.  So it may take 2 seconds for a child to get a question right, but then she has to watch 10-15 seconds of animation before even seeing the next problem.  It was interesting for her the first time around, but after that, my daughter was getting bored with seeing the same animation over and over after each problem.  This might work for a child that likes to watch TV and hates phonics, but my daughter really wants to learn to read, so this did not work for her at all.  I would not recommend this software.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Stay Tuned for Danger is the follow-up Nancy Drew game to the award-winning Secrets Can Kill. While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of \"Light of Our Love\" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...\n\nThe plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.\n\nThe quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.\n\nSadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.\n\nThe graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).\n\nThe characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where \"Light of Our Love\" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of \"Light of Our Love\". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive \"suspects\". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.\n\nThe music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect \"New York City\" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.\n\nWhile Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!", "label": 0}

Its graphic design and user interface is intuitive and well laid-out.  The supplied documentation is excellent.  The program is packed with features-it gives the user a great deal of control over the creative process of making a home video.  I have used the trial versions of Ulead and Roxio's consumer offerings (in the same price range) and I believe Studio 8 offers more features and more control.\nAs much as I love the design and the features, I was very disappointed with the quality.  I bought this almost a year after it was released, and even with the latest patches I had problems with various bugs.  I have basically had to wait for two additional patches to be released (mid-October 2003 being the latest) before getting to the point of actually being able to make a movie and burn it to disc.\nStudio 8 is one of the bugiest programs that I have ever used on a PC.  What bothered me most about the bugs I encountered was that they affected simple tasks-not the computationally intensive, hardware-challenging processes.  I captured video from my camera, compiled movies (with lots of sound & video clips, transitions, etc.) and rendered the finished video without problems.  It was the simpler stuff that Studio 8 consistently crashed on.  It would crash when I tried to edit text to overlay on the video.  It would crash when I tried to add a still image.  It crashed while trying to burn the finished video data to a CD.  These are all things that are relatively simple for a PC to do, and are done flawlessly by many other software products.\nI now like Studio 8, but it caused me a lot of frustration and cost me a lot of time and money (I had to upgrade to Windows XP to fix some of the problems) to come to like it.\nStudio 8 has been steadily improving with the release of patches, but a lot of people out there are still having problems, as evidenced by the postings on their tech support website.\nMy advice is:  Do not even consider buying this product without first trying the downloadable demo.  This isn't a guarantee, because some features are disabled in it, but it will go a long way in helping you to see if it will run on your system.

I just seem to find issues with actually finding a use for MS Money.\n\nIt becomes even more difficult if certain bills change, or you have varying income.  How do you plan a budget, etc... when your income changes week to week?  It seems to become more of an annoyance than a useful tool.\n\nBut WHEN would MS Money be useful?  If you have some steady income, or have some serious budgeting issues, if you cut your finances really close every month, this may help you budget yourself a little better.  But really... who DOESNT know how much their bills are month after month?\n\nSo I was really hoping the online capabilities would make this thing great.  But they don't.  The software \"offers\" integration with my accounts, but 4 out of 5 of my institutions, will not bring up any information in MS Money, so yup, I get to login to my financial institution manually, then download the file into money, thus, making it pointless to use MS Money in the first place.

{"text": "- Windows XP (XP = Experince) is, as of this date, the latest of Microsoft's very populare operating systems. Based on the NT technology, XP is one of the most steadiest operating systems i've ever laied my hands on. It's 90% automatic to new hardware and when you connect to the internet. Remember all the IP protocolls and LAN configurations that gave you a hard time when you went a LAN party with Windows 95 and 98? Forget that! Windows XP finds all the LAN users instantly (some configuration must be done, but not much). XP might sound like a perfect operating system, but it has many flaws. If you have a program or a game you really love, but is DOS based; Then XP wount run them unless you've installed some sort of patch or a emulator. Many of the old Win98 programs (Virus Scanners and such) wount install on XP. Also, the CONTROLL PANEL is seriously confusing the first time you enter it. XP is also very sensitive with certain hardwares, meaning the operating system will sometimes restart and shut down certain programs if it isent comfortable with the hardware installed. Beside this, the XP is a so-so system. Very recommented for office use and such, but gamers and programmers should look else where...", "label": 2}
{"text": "Firstly, in common with Activision's previous Star Trek title, Elite Force, this is far too short for a full price game.  The plot's none too poor, and has some pleasant twists that suprise, but the gameplay is repetitive and limited, so that by the end it has ceased to be a joy and more like a test of stamina.  Of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out, each mission's requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway.  Couple this with the fact that you have to micro-manage your team's every move (they won't even shoot back when shot at, just cry out) and there's no multiplayer option except co-operative over a LAN, means that this is one isometric squad-based shooter to be avoided. If you like this style of game you could do worse than buying Fallout Tactics instead, or save yourself [the money] and pick up a copy of Abomination - The Nemesis Project.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I had always wanted an aquarium program/screensaver and I ended up purchasing Aquazone Seven Seas collection because it was free after a manufacturer rebate. Overall, the program is well made. The interface is easy to use and installation was simple as well. After seeing aquarium programs being run on new computers at local stores, I had expected a certain level of visual quality from this program. The fish in Aquazone looked fine. Their movements and color was comparable to some of the higher end computers. However, the various backgrounds that were offered with the program were below average. The two dimensional appearance of the backgrounds stand out too much in my opinion. I wished that the background would blend in with the fish more smoothly. There are actually two backgrounds with three dimensional portions, but that makes the two dimensional parts stand out even more. I would recommend this product for people who want a simple aquarium program, but for people looking for the best aquarium software, look some where else.", "label": 2}

It does show the direction of one way streets, and Interstate exits are better shown and numbered, but the map database itself appears to be completely unchanged.

I saw IntelliMover and thought I would try it, primarily because it moves over my specific setting preferences and email without time consuming burning and without having to figure out XP's hidden identity files. I watched the demonstration and hooked my computers together with the provided usb cable. Everything worked, and it didn't take that long. Just be aware that for things to move over seamlessly you have to have your software programs already installed onto the computer you are moving stuff to. Also, it seems to be more difficult with more than a one time use, I don't know from experience but would be nervous to use it again. I would have given this software a much higher star rating if I felt confident that it could be used multiple times for paying the price to own the program. Another thing is, the IntelliMover file is still on my hard drive and I don't know what to do about it, should I trash it now? If I need to use the program again in the future should the older file be removed and/or will it recognize the previous actions? I do like that the program has two options, pull over all data, or manually select the files you would like to be moved over, however, it also pulled over a couple of files that I didn't want.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I have been using a Garmin Vista C GPS since it was introduced, and although I have previously encountered serious problems with Garmin products, I decided to take a chance and buy this MapSource CD ROM from them.  I solo hike in national forests, and I thought that if Garmin's maps provided any additional information whatever, then it might be worth the $79 I paid for it.  I should have known better.  This product is absolutely worthless as far as my needs and interests go.  It would take a very long time to enumerate all of the product's many flaws, so here's a very short list.  The documentation and help files are atrocious.  They don't even provide clear information about how to transfer map data to the GPS.  The CD ROM (on which the maps reside) must be inserted in your computer whenever you use MapSource, which means there'll be plenty of unnecessary wear and tear on your CD ROM drive.  That's right!  Proving that they are truly dunderheads of staggering proportions, Garmin's \"genius engineers\" won't even let you copy these maps to your harddrive...no matter how big it is!!!  And once map data are transferred to the GPS, I have found them to be unhelpful and inaccurate.  For instance, two water holes shown on the map are mislocated by several miles.  If you need water during a hike and you intend to rely on Garmin...GOOD LUCK!  One of the most annoying problems concerns the \"scaling\" algorithm used to display the map data on my GPS.  Is this a GPS problem, a map problem, some combination problem?  I DON'T care, because both products were made by Garmin...so Garmin owns the problems!  Once again Garmin's resident geniuses used an appallingly stupid strategy that reflects a total failure to understand who their customers are and what they're trying to do.  For example, when I zoom into get a close look at my location, various forest service roads are sometimes displayed.  I'd like to see where they go, naturally, so I zoom out a bit to get a better view of them.  WHAM!  They suddenly vanish completely from the display!  Yep, they are not displayed at all.  Instead of seeing them, the screen is crowded with the names of landmarks that are many miles from my location and that have no relevance to what I'm trying to do.  My frustrating experiences have led me to conclude that the GPS/map market is dominated by little-league, back-water, third-rate players like Garmin and DeLorme.  I have had extensive experience with some of their products, and I have always found them to be totally unacceptable.  I hope and pray that a major league player...like Google, Apple, or even Microsoft...will some day take an interest in this market and crush the losers who currently occupy it.  Think about it:  a Google cell phone with integrated GPS and the ability to download highly detailed topo maps (and related internet data) in real time!  WOW!  Can't wait for that to happen.  In the meantime, I resent the fact that Garmin's hyper-inflated marketing claims have once again convinced me to waste my money on a piece of Garmin trash.  I will do my best to avoid buying any other products from them.  They should spend less money on marketing and more on customer-centered engineering.  In other words, they should start to build some decent products!", "label": 0}

Thankfully, that policy is now gone.\n\nAnother big relief: a huge performance bug that affects small business owners has finally been solved. If you are a small business owner that has been using MacInTax/TurboTax Deluxe for many years to track depreciation on business property, you have found that every year that you added new items to the list, navigating through that list got slower and sssllllllooooowwwwwwerrrrrr.

{"text": "I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n\nI should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.", "label": 2}

However, when I tried to add line items expenses to the PDA and then transfer them to the main program, I found that it said it was downloading them and then didn't.  I find the only way to keep things accurate is still the old fashioned way of going to the main PC and doing the data entry.  So what I thought would save me time, didn't and so it needs improving so that it will do what it says.  Perhaps it is because I'm using quicken 2001.  I will likely upgrade and see if that makes any difference in the interfacing.  Also, I tried keeping a backup copy of quicken on my PC at the office (just in case my home PC ever crashed) and I sometimes take a zip drive backup and update it that way to keep it current.  However, when trying to sync my palm with it, that is to update, it only works in reverse ... where Palm gets only latest info from PC not true sync where palm may already be more updated.  I had to go home and hotsync to get my palm back to correct figures.  So I've told my office PC to simply ignore pocket quicken when syncing to palm.  If these two areas could be addressed and stocks updated (as others have said), PC Quicken would really be useful.  For now all it can do for me is allow me to download from my home PC to palm (after I've sat at the home PC and trugged out the data entry on the QUICKEN program).

{"text": "(I would rate this product 2 1/2 stars if I could)\nI opened up a new small business and was trying to decide whether I should upgrade my Quicken 2002 deluxe to either Quicken 2003 Home and Business or the Microsoft Money equivalent. I ultimately ended up upgrading to Quicken and now think this is a mistake of epic proportion.\nThere is good news and bad news. First the good news. The program does a lot of cool stuff that I need to do. I pay all my bills online and have never had a (major) problem. Occasionally, I will get the little annoyances like when all my transactions were duplicated and I had to go back and delete two years of double transaction. However, I must say that the program overall is a time saver and helps me keep track of all my expenses, both home and business. I never thought I would ever need all those little accounting details until the IRS did a complete anal exam and wanted everything in excruciating detail. Sure did come in handy.\nHOWEVER, for some reason, Quicken refuses to upgrade their user interface to the new millennium. There are so many features that are stuck in the 80s and 90s that it makes it more difficult to use. For example, to set preferences, you have to click the menu-preference-preference item several time to get them all. All other software brings up one preference screen with tabs in it to set all the preferences at once.\nAnd then the big beef. Here is a \"suggestion\" I sent today to Intuit. I will let it speak for itself.\n--------------------\nThis is not going to be a happy comment. So if you are not emotionally prepared for a very unhappy customer, please forward this message on to someone else. It won't be abusive or anything like that, but I am going to vent some of my frustrations.\nI just purchased Quicken 2003 for Home and Business. In general, I am pleased with the product as it should do just about everything I need it to do. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT, some of the marketing that is forced in my face every time I use the program is so despicable and outright onerous that some days I just feel like throwing the whole computer out the window. Why must I put up with all the blatant advertising? No other program on the market puts users through such trials and tribulations. In fact, when I was choosing between Quicken and Money, I almost bought Money hoping that it would not subject its users to such treatment. I can't tell you how much I dislike using the program knowing that every time I look at the screen, I am going to be bombarded with advertising and marketing. I can tell you, that because of it, I will NEVER use your services. That is how much I disdain your mistreatment of customers.\nOK, fine. That should be enough. I think you get the idea. So my suggestion is obvious. Tone down your advertising, or at least allow the users to turn off the display of ALL advertising. For example, the little links on the bottom like \"Can your business benefit from Quickbooks?\"\nDo I feel better? Not really as I still have to endure the painful experience of these little annoyances ever time I use Quicken. I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE have more respect for your customers and their sanity.\n--------------------\nBottom line, would I buy Quicken 2003 if I had to do it all over again? Maybe, but I would investigate Microsoft Money more thoroughly first. Reading the comments about Money though, seems like there is no best solution. Good luck!", "label": 2}

{"text": "If you want a good introduction to the Spanish language, I think this program would be helpful to you. It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:\n\nI received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.\n\nThere were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.\n\nI'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.\n\nIf you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that. Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable. But to actually learn to converse with Spanish speakers, I think you need something more.", "label": 1}

They show you the item and you're supposed to pick what it is. Honestly, it's not that difficult to mess that up. I was very disappointed in the voice/microphone aspect of it. With instant immersion you speak into the microphone, but the program doesn't grade/rate how well you did it. It just records it, so you can listen to yourself again. What good is that? In Rosetta Stone, the program actually determines how well you said it and gives you a rating, this really helped me improve my accent. Also for vocabulary, you can get an even better program and it's FREE. Go to SpanishDict com and their flashcard games are great. They even have video lectures, which are also free. Back to Instant Immersion, the grammar portion seemed okay, it involved you putting random phrases in the correct order. For people with a decent amount of Spanish, this program is also too basic, which I should've been tipped off on by Level 1,2,3. What prevents this from getting 1 star is the company's awesome return policy. A week after buying it, I mailed the product back to the company asking for a refund (because they have a money back offer) and a month later, I got a check in the mail. I had to pay for shipping, which wasn't too much. So if you're on the fence, buy this product and if you hate it like me, send it back for a full refund. In the end, all you risked is about 4 bucks for return shipping.", "label": 0}

If you so much as even look at it wrong you have to restart it. Notice how they say \"System Restore quickly restores your computer to a previous state\", it's because you'll need it when you have to reboot it 3 times each day! It does have some great features bundled up into this packaged, but seriously, wait for the 2nd Edition to come out. In addition to they new features, you'll find that it uses more RAM than previous versions. This can be bad news if you don't have ample memory (what they have listed in the system requirements is a bare minimum.  Maybe then they'll fix the bugs, but for now it's not worth the price they've put on it.  Stick with 952ndEd or 98SE.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I anxiously awaited my copy of Route 66 for MAC.  As a recent convert from Windows XP, I have been spoiled by Microsoft Streets and Trips maping software.  I was at first very pleased with this program as it has very complete and accurate streets and directions for my area, (a suburb of Los Angeles).  It is not completely intuitive and the user instructions are somewhat difficult to follow.  It does not come with any manual or written directions and the website has scant information.  The FAQ section is worthless.  However with a little patience one can use it without too many problems by trial and error if you have ever used Microsoft Streets and Trips, it is very similar.\nHowever, now for the down sides.  It will not print directions or strip maps.  I have a new copy of Panther, (not an upgrade) on a new G5 with top end everything.  I have tried it on laserjet and ink jet printers with the same results.  Every time I hit the print command, the program either freezes and must be forced to quit or it will quit unexpectedly and all your directions are lost so you must then again open the program and find all the streets and so on over and over.  It will Print the map using the current view command but you must manually write all the directions.\nI have tried to contact the company for support but they do not list a phone number and the only way to contact them is by email.  I have written them several times over the last two weeks and all I get is an automatic response saying the email was received by Route 66 and channeled to the proper section.  The have not responded and they have not apparantly fixed the bugs.\nThere are a few other more minor problems, for expample, when you put in all the destinations you want to map out it will sometimes pick a less desireable or illogical route than you might if you analyse the streets for density and traffic controls.  However it will get you there and you an alter the route without too much difficulty.\nOverall I am mixed on the program.  For the moment, there is nothing to compare to Microsoft Streets and Trips other than this for MAC and it has potential, but I need to print out routes quickly and easily without all the problems I am now experiencing.  I would say wait to see if they work out the bugs and then you will have a great alternative to the PC programs available.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm a big Apple fan and was an early adopter of OS X.  I always jump on the new upgrades quickly.  Panther was a great upgrade, Tiger is not.  If you're still running Jaguar and are looking to upgrade - go for it.  For the average Pather user, there's not alot going on here, aside from Dashboard.  Most of the improvements are under the hood, which would be fine if the OS were more reliable, but this is the most unstable OS X since 1.0.  My applications are constantly crashing and, after becoming accustomed to OS stablity, this is unacceptable and particularly annoying.  I'm running a 1.25 G4 Powerbook with a Gig of RAM.  Here's my reaction to the highlighted features:\n\nSPOTLIGHT is cool and very fast.  It is really handy if you want to find and open a specific file, but if you want to open the location of that file (so you can handle the file, as opposed to opening it), you're out of luck.  You can hold your mouse over the spotlight result and a little box will open to show you the finder path to the location, but you can't click to open the location, instead you have to go navigate through the actual finder windows to get there.\n\niCHAT - The good news?  Multiple user video conferencing!  Awesome!  The bad news?  System requirements.  You'll need a high end machine to join and an even higher end machine to host.  Standard one on one chats are still great, but for the average user, this new multi-user feature is inaccessable.\n\nPARENTAL CONTROLS - My child is 2 months old.  I look forward to having these features much later in the game.  I'm going to assume they're great, but at this point I have no idea.\n\nDASHBOARD is crippled by lags and delays.  The whole point of Dashboard is instant access, but if you access the Dashboard and have to wait 10+ seconds before it becomes active, there's not much point.  For example, accessing the calculator on the Dashboard should be faster than digging into your Applications folder to open the calculator there.  Or, there's a what-would-be-handy iTunes controller that you can access in less than one second from any application, but then it takes about 30 seconds to become active - what's the point?  Your mileage may vary, and I hope it does.\n\nAUTOMATOR might be great.  I tried to use it once and eventually gave up.  It seems like a lot of work went into a feature with extremely narrow application.  I don't know.  Mixed bag.  I'll reserve judgment.  Just because it wasn't what I was looking for, doesn't mean it won't be perfect for you.\n\nSAFARI is still great.  The addition of RSS feeds will be exciting for alot of people.  It hasn't rocked my world, but it's a modern feature of the modern web browser and it's nice to see Apple leading the way.\n\nMAIL has added the slideshow/photo handling feature.  This rocks.  This is great.  This is worth the price of admission.\n\n.MAC SYNC is different.  I don't think it's better or worse, just different.  Pretty much don't need the iSync application anymore because it's built into the OS.  This means instead of opening the iSync application to access syncing controls, you open the system preferences application to access syncing controls.\n\nVOICEOVER could be great.  Never tried it.  No idea.\n\nQUICKTIME 7 makes Safari hang when I try to download .mpgs.  I'm angry about this.  None of the patches to date to either QT or the OS have fixed this.  So, again, all the new under the hood encoding may be cool, but on the surface, it's still the same QT player, only now you have to pay to re-access QT pro and it often makes Safari hang for as many as 30 seconds.

So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:\n\nFirst, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\n\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\n\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\n\nI don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\n\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\n\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.", "label": 1}

This could have led to definitive, high quality software versions of games like Boggle.  Instead we have a game with ridiculous and chintzy graphic effects that do nothing for gameplay, an array of absurd \"sub-games,\" and, most importantly, a software product that does not seem to get updated/patched.\nThe game is playable (at least on some versions of Windows), and playing opponents on the internet is perhaps its strongest selling point.  However, the release of this product also brought a wave of legal action against existing rogue Boggle-like sites ...The result, unfortunately, probably did more to hurt the Boggle community than help, as most rogue sites, in addition to being free and platform independent, were also responsive to user requests and are now largely shut down.\nHasbro is depending on market-share and market-reach to sell this game.

{"text": "I have to say that the product does work. In fact, it works pretty well, but because the manual doesn't really cover a lot of the basic problems in setting up the card and the program, I recommend caution in buying this product. If you have computer knowledge and certain degree of perseverance, this is for you. If you get intimidated by changing windows system settings, monkeying around in your device manager and cleaning your registry, you might want to think twice.\nOn the plus side, the firewire capture worked very well the first time and its pretty easy to do. The analog capture is more difficult to get figured out, but it works well too once you're set up correctly. You'd better have a lot of hard drive space - like an extra 20 gig for a 90 minute video.\nI had to contact technical support on a couple of relatively minor issues and found out that technical support is pretty bad. You can get support via email (you need to have your serial number handy to do this). I don't recommend going this route, however, because it's a 24 hour turn-around for each question and response. And the responses are awful -- just quotes from the manual. \"Make sure all background programs are closed.\" \"Make sure your chipset drivers are updated.\" \"Make sure you defrag your hard drive...\" It goes on and on. And they won't give you a substantive answer until you promise you have done all of the \"stock\" things that the manual already tells you to do. I'm on day 4 with email tech support over a green line that showed up on one of my captured videos. The tech support person keeps giving me one more little \"task\" to do before he will address the issue of why there is a line on one video capture but not others. Email support is abysmal in its helpfulness.\nTelephone support, on the other hand, isn't bad. I would like to give you the technical support telephone number, but its against Amazon's rules.  That's a shame, I could have saved you 20 minutes because that's how long it will take you to find it. From what I can tell you get your first call free and they want $30 for all subsequent calls. Ouch! That hurts, especially when the manual doesn't tell you how to actually capture video using the S-video connector. (You've got to make a change to a setting at an odd place in the software and its not addressed in the manual or in the help file that comes with the product.)\nMy bottom line is that the product works, but you have to be ready to take your lumps on the technical support side. I've transferred a couple of home videos from MiniDV format as well as a kid's vhs tape for use as a svcd. I'm happy with both. Now that I'm past the initial learning curve, I hope I can enjoy the product more. If you're the faint of heart type or don't have a bunch of computer experience, this product is probably not for you.

{"text": "As I indicated in an earlier review, this is head and shoulders above any other anti-spam program I have encountered; however, there is one little glitch that is irritating, and this is how I handle it:\nFirst, I am running Outlook Express for my e-mail,  This may be the only e-mail program so affected, I don't know, but every 3 or 4 days, someone sends me an e-mail that stops the system, and won't let any following e-mails through.  The first couple of times, I called up my server, and they told me that it was either a corrupted e-mail or one that was too long, and they removed it.  Presto, the other messages, which had been held up at the server, came through. It's like clearing a blockage in your plumbing.\nThen, I started to think.  Next time it happened, I closed  Outlook Express and then I disabled Norton Antispam and brought up Outlook Express again, and everything, including spam of course, came through.  Then, I enabled Norton Antispam again, and deleted the spam by hand.\nNote: save your breath!  Enabling Norton Antispam during transmission of a block of e-mails doesn't work.  The entire block still comes through, including spam.\nIt was Norton that was stopping the corrupted e-mail and stopping the system!\nIt IS a bummer to have to delete 100 or more spam e-mails, but you can highlight a group of them and delete, just be careful not to delete the ones you want to keep, that would normally get through.\nAs long as your e-mail is blocked, the system (at least mine) will keep sending you duplicates of the messages in front of the blockage every few minutes.\nIt is still the best system around for killing spam, but this is an irritating glitch.  Maybe they'll fix it, in time.\nMaybe the best answer is to begin executing spammers and the idiots who are making viruses and worms, etc., and give us back our internet.\nI run Norton's firewall and anti-virus, as well as an ad-blocker.  I wish it wasn't necessary, but it is.  Between them they catch several viruses a week attempting to break in, and almost all spam, so obviously it's a necessary precaution.\nP.S. I have finally had to deep-six Norton's Antispam, 2004.  The reason?  The corrupted messages, if that's what was causing the disruption, were happening daily.  Each day, I had to disable Norton's Antispam in order to get my e-mail, and the flood gates opened, letting all the spam, through.  So, what's the use?  My server has a program which stops spam before it gets to me, and it's free.  Some still gets through, but not much.  So I have uninstalled Norton's program.\n\nNorton really needs to fix this glitch.\n\nJoseph (Joe) Pierre\n\nauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance\nand other books", "label": 2}

{"text": "This product is helpful in many ways, unhelpful in others.  Here are the unhelpful features:\n\n1. While there is adequate learning of vocabulary and grammar, there is little opportunity to learn conversational French the way it is really spoken.\n\n2. Typically, the product offers the learner panels of four pictures from which to choose the one correct response to a given statement or question. But frequently the choice is obvious--e.g., the statement or question has to do with horses, but only one of the four response panels shows horses. So one can guess the right response without really understanding what is being said or asked. No learning is taking place here. In the example cited, it would be better if all four response panels concerned horses so that the learner would really have to understand what is being said or asked in order to give the right response.\n\n3. The breakdown of each level into lessons, units, and exercises is somewhat confusing, and navigating among them is awkward.\n\n4. When moving from one four-panel section to the next, the native speaker's voice in the new section is often clipped off so that the first word or two is unheard. Hearing the entire phrase, of course, can make all the difference in understanding what the speaker is saying and is critical to giving the right response. The manufacturer has twice shown us how to adjust our computer's audio mechanism to fix this, but the fix still does not work very well. This is a fault in production of the software disk.\n\n5. The software on the disk cannot be downloaded into the user's computer, meaing the user must insert the disk each time and wait for it to upload for use.\n\nIn general, this product is useful for beginners or near-beginners.

{"text": "I got Counterspy a couple days ago and tried to load it yesterday. Nothing happened. I tried to load it again. Nothing happened. I've never had an install disk that never worked and immediately thought I had a bad disk and CD Drive so I put in a language disk and it worked so I thought I had a bad Counterspy disk so I called them.  Thought I'd go into retirement waiting until someone came to the phone. When I did get someone I was pleased to discover a nice tech who said she'd help me install the program. I was even more pleased to discover from her that she didn't try to give lame excuses as to why the disk didn't work immediately which I've found is rare with tech support because they're too eager to blame your computer thinking their software is always perfect. Directly from the CD drive did we try to install, but Spy Sweeper kept interferring and we had to constantly shut that down. After two tries we got the disk installed, we ran a scan and all was well. I discovered that if I turned off Spysweeper's Active-X shield Counterspy could do it's job. One person had complained that as long as you don't try to activate links in your e-mail you're fine. I tried that and had no problem. I really like the features of Counterspy. When you click the system tools you have My PC Explorer which allows you to manage systems on your computer that are hard to change. My PC Checkup patches security holes and windows vulnerabilities. History Cleaner allows you to deal with getting rid of things there so now I have two means. The great thing about that it tells you what histories you have instead of searching. Secure File Eraser allows you to choose what you want to deal with and encrypts the file before deleting leaving nothing behind. I like the fact that you can put your curser on any one of these things and the explanations happen rather than actually have to click it to open. The Active Protection lets you know what it's monitoring and what's blocked that you choose. I don't know a thing about that so I'm leaving that alone. The Spyware scan is amazingly fast unlike Spysweeper that can take as long as 12 minutes. I like the cute moving graphics as it scans.  Where the jury is still out will come with my year long subscription. Will they be like Spysweeper who turns your subscriptions back making you renew when you don't have to. Will they send too many reminder notices when you know you have plenty of time left like Spysweeper. Will certain things expire where you can't correct them while everything works and is current in subscription like my '04 Norton Internet Security. What I really liked about the tech was when you tell them a problem, they directly address it whether they know the answer or not. They're not like Spysweeper who addresses what you have no problem with because they're too stupid to know the answer, nor will they admit they're at fault and placate you with sorry for your inconveniance while getting off on your frustration. I'll assume for the moment that Counterspy's scans are accurate. Maybe when I register Counterspy it'll show subscription activation date and when it's up. My second hope is that if I need tech support I don't get Social Security before someone comes to the phone. We'll see after I've had it a while if this was really worth the money.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I wrote a review when I first used the 2011 version, and then erased it. I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will. I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print. Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper.\n\nI also find the \"help\" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside. It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent. So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess. Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better.\n\nI find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself. The big example here is Quicken, I have an old 2000 version and it's really just a register for you to input finances, not an organizing or accounting tool at all.

{"text": "I loved Appleworks for OS9. It provided a straightforward, easy-to-use word processor, spreadsheet, database, and illustration tools at very reasonable cost. Appleworks had everything anyone would need for home use -except the ability to read or write MS Word documents. I used Appleworks for personal projects, though, because it was a pleasure to use. Appleworks 6.2.9 for OSX is an entirely different animal. It's buggy beyond belief. Apple shouldn't have released software that has not been successfully upgraded for their current operating system. (I don't know why Amazon is still selling 6.2.7, as I bought 6.2.9 months ago. But the two versions have no obvious differences.)\n\nThe good news is that Appleworks can now read MS Word documents...sort of. When you open a Word document, it launches TextEdit. You can read the document in TextEdit and modify it if you like. But tabs don't translate well. If there are columns created with tabs, the document will be indecipherable. Other nice features (that are not new) include a convenient thesaurus. It's not comprehensive, but it is good enough to be useful in finding definitions and alternatives to words. It's easy to turn off \"Smart Quotes\" in Preferences, and one click of the mouse will make it the default. No need to create a template. The spellchecker works when you tell it to, not while you're typing.\n\nCreating a good-looking document and, in fact, knowing how it will look when printed is a frustrating undertaking. What was so simple and easy in OS9 has become a challenge in OSX. The first thing you will notice when you begin to create a document is the size of the document window. Appleworks' windows no longer open to a usable size. They are small. So first you must resize the window using the zoom percentage tool in the lower left-hand corner. 125% should be about right for most purposes. Then, for word processing, you will need to select \"fractional character widths\" in Preferences, if you'd like to be able to read what you've typed. Otherwise most fonts will display with gaps between some letters while others are on top of one another, making it impossible to see the periods at the end of sentences or to tell which spaces between words and letters are real. Oddly, even without fractional character widths enabled, the document will print without odd spaces. Fonts also print much heavier than they appear. Type looks wispy onscreen and barely legible in some fonts, but they print fine. That's not much help if you can't see how it will look as you are creating the document.\n\nSome lines are missing the last couple of tabs on the line, making it impossible to use tabs to line up text on the far right side of the document. The cursor jumps down to the next line before it should. I have disabled the .cwk suffix in Preferences, but it still appears on some documents, and I cannot get rid of it manually. The font menu sticks and is difficult to scroll down. The spellcheck window appears inconveniently at the very bottom of the screen. It can be moved, but it is far too small and cannot be resized. Appleworks won't save documents with backslashes in the file name, although you can inexplicably add the backslashes later.\n\nNone of these problems were present in Appleworks 6.0 or 6.2 that I had for OS9. I experimented with Appleworks 6.2.7 and 6.2.9 in an Apple store to make sure I didn't just have a defective copy and found the same deficiencies. So I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend Appleworks for OSX, although I enjoyed using it in OS9. I couldn't say how 6.2.7 or 6.2.9 perform in OS9, but I wouldn't risk the upgrade if I still had OS9. I would copy Appleworks 6.2 and install the upgrade on one copy only, to see how it goes.", "label": 2}

Future dollar reports do not exist.

Throughout the tax year, you could simply go to Itsdeductible.com & download updates along with revisions on the \"fair market values\" of items. When tax time came around, I used TurboTax & simply imported my donations from ItsDeductable. I found ItsDeductable easy to use and have used it for the 2001, 2002 & 2003 tax years.\n\nI've read some reviews where folks wanted to print out the \"market values\" so they can simply do an inventory of non-cash items then go back to the computer and input the information. Unfortunately, ItsDeductable won't allow you to do this. You are forced to make a hand written list.  I've always had an issue with this.\n\nBE AWARE!, ItsDectible has had some significant problems since the 2003 year. This year (2004), I can no longer download updates from ItsDeductible.com.

{"text": "I recently purchased a new computer which came with Windows 2000 Professional.  I was very pleased with the operating system which is definitely more stable than Windows 98, which I used on my other computers.  So, I purchased the Windows 2000 Pro upgrade to upgrade the remainder of my computers.\nAgony.\nThe biggest problem with the upgrade was backwards compatibility.  Windows 2000 did not have a driver for any of my peripherals.  It did not install drivers for my printer, my scanner, my video card, my tape drive, my modem or my SCSI controller.  In short, nothing but the computer worked.  I had to use another computer to download a driver for my modem to start the process.  Once I had my modem running, I had to search the web to download and install drivers for each of my peripherals one at a time.\nBut wait, there's more.  Not only was it not compatible with the hardware, but also with much of the software on which I constantly rely.  This meant that I had to search the web for patches and upgrades for many of my applications.\nThe upgrade for one computer took two days.  That was about an hour to upgrade Windows and about 10-12 hours of finding and downloading drivers and patches.  The process was shorter for subsequent computers because I already had the downloads.\nAfter having endured this torment, I would have to say that with Windows XP so close at hand, I would recommend that you wait before upgrading.  I don't know if XP will have the same backwards compatibility issues, but if it does, it makes sense to only go through this torture once instead of twice.", "label": 0}

And not entirely accurate (Steeplechase...) it is a fun game. The voice acting is bad (the only Swedish voice actors I ever liked were in a few cartoons, otherwise yelling and showing emotions seems alien to most of them) and the graphics old, I still play it from time to time along with the Swedish versions of Mysteriet och Drmjobbet, and according to Rosemond [...] there will be a new horse game this autumn which reprises Annie and stars a new girl named Amanda.\n\nSince it is a game that I've had for several years I won't compare it to newer games such as The Sims 2 or Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, but I do admit that the bad graphics puts me off sometimes.

You can read the other reviews and get a feel for the features of the program; You can also visit their website.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nYou will pay a lot of money for this program, this is what you get: 1) An install/application disc which is the base program. This disc is the same disc that will come in all the Rosetta Stone programs. They are interchangeable. 2) You will get one CD that holds all the data for French One and Two. 3) You will get two workbooks, one for level I and the second for level II. Basically these workborks are a verbatum index of what is presented on the software. I would be surprised if you use them, in fact you can get better workbooks from your local bookstore for less than $15. Summary: You are getting one CD of data and two cheap workbooks for a good bit of money.

After reading the description for BH&G Home Designer Deluxe, I thought I would give it a try, as there were several limitations to my version that I wanted to get fixed. I have been very disappointed in this new version. While the user interface is much improved and the 3D objects are much more realistic looking, basic functionality has not improved much in my opinion. The stairway tool still needs much work, printing is cumbersome, and some very simple capabilities are only available in the PRO version. For example, changing the size of your floor joists is not possible in this version, which seems like a very minor thing to add. That's pretty significant when trying to plan stairs and riser/tread sizes. Dimensioning is confusing. The tool, in trying to do things automatically, won't let you draw things the way they currently exist. Some capabilities have actually been lost in moving to this new version. Concrete piers for foundations for example. You can draw them, but the dimensioning tool will not recognize them.\n\nI know pickin's are slim for affordable tools, and this tool does give you the basics and is useful especially if you have never used a program like this before. However, if you have used similar tools in the past, I don't see much to gain other than glitz.\n\nMost of the online help and tips are directed to the PRO version, and the solutions offered do not apply to this Deluxe version.\n\nI have been tempted to move up to the PRO version, but have low confidence that it will provide the features and fixes I am looking for.", "label": 2}

{"text": "First, I agree completely with the previous review, which stated that it is foolish to expect this emulator to allow you to run high-end games like a native Windows machine. That's just not going to happen.\n\nAs for myself, I use VPC for a small group of Windows-only programs (a bibliography database, some astronomy progs., and very little else), and I am grateful to have it, because these very useful pieces of software would otherwise be unavailable to me. In addition, all of the programs I have tried to run in VPC have installed and opperated smoothly, and the installation of the emulator itself was no problem.\n\nSo, why only 3 stars? Because Virtual PC is, far and away, and without even a remotely close second, the *most* memory- and system-intensive program I have ever encountered. Mind you, I am running a reasonably powerful machine (G5, 1.8Ghz processor, 1 gig of RAM, plenty of hard drive space, etc.). Nevertheless, I would estimate that VPC takes about 2-2.5 *minutes* to load and as much as 6 (yes, you read that right SIX) minutes to save and shut down. Call me crazy, but a six minute shutdown time is absolutely absurd, for ANY program... if they couldn't refine it any more than that, they probably should have tweaked the software a bit before releasing it. Add to this the fact that, while it is running, my system slows to a physically painful crawl, making any sort of multitasking an excersize in extreme patience...\n\nI do plan to upgrade to 2 gigs of memory in the near future, and maybe that will help a bit, but I can't fathom how anyone with either less memory, or a slower processor than the specs I outlined above, could possibly run this program, without putting a hole in their computer's monitor.\n\nGood luck.", "label": 2}

It truly is a great program, but with the stupidity that I will explain below.\n\nThe value of the GPS unit is poor, and here's why:\n\n  You cannot utilize the GPS to give you turn by turn directions, rather just follow your current location along a pre-created route.  A big disappointment in my mind.\n\n  Second, you cannot utilize the GPS with Pocket Streets, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Why have pocket streets and a GPS unit when you can't integrate the 2 together?  These are major drawbacks of the software/hardware bundle that should lead you to consider another product.\n\nI ended up buying DeLorme Street Atlas USA as an adjunct to the GPS unit to use with my handheld device.  The microsoft device is compatible to the software, so there wasn't an issue of buying a new GPS device.  If your devices have Bluetooth, just go with DeLorme's program and device in general, though not as colorful and user friendly, you'll get the bang for your buck.\n\nI'm sure in the 2006 package of Streets & Trips they'll include the feature's I just spoke about them missing, as it is microsoft, and they want you to buy every single new version possible.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Owning  every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, it's evident how much the games have changed over time, and whether it's improved graphics or more detailed character design, it's usually for the better. I still love to play the games from the classic part of the series (games one through nine), and although this one definitely isn't the best of the first few games, there are still a few positive aspects in this one, you just have to look hard to find some of them.\n\nStory: 8/10. This story is somewhat of a rarity for the Nancy Drew games, because it's pretty much two stories in one mystery: Ghoulish ghost dogs appear in the middle of the night and try to maul Sally McDonald's house (the house Nancy stays at in the game). There is also the theory that a man named Mickey Malone buried treasure somewhere on Sally's property, which used to be his land. I loved the idea of two stories, and these two melded together pretty well, and were pretty well done.\n\nGraphics/Setting: 7/10. Since this game was released in late 2002, the graphics aren't going to be that amazing, but the setting was somewhat decent, as you got to explore a convenience store, a forest, a graveyard, a sheriff station and the actual house Nancy stays at.\n\nCharacters: 6.5/10. This game has one or two less suspects than usual Nancy Drew games (this one has 3 people that you meet in person), and they somewhat feel bland. You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely aren't the highlight of this game.\n\nPuzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. They're aren't many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this game's score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. They're really isn't anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.\n\nActivities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lake's history on the Sheriff's computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.\n\nEnding:\n7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. I'm sure you know what I mean\n\nTotal (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....\n\n6.5/10.\n\nWhile there can still be some fun to be had with this game if you're a diehard fan like me, I'd recommend that new Nancy Drew PC fans or someone looking for one of the games to buy, look at another HERInteractive title for now.", "label": 2}

Install worked on #1 and #2, but Outlook refuses to connect to email on machine 2. Just hangs up. My third, primary, machine was a total disaster. It would not install, so I got remote \"help\" from Microsoft. The first tech screwed it up by editing multiple registries, and renaming folders. After that, it would no longer even return to Office 2010 from a valid DVD. A second tech finally undid enough to get Office 365 working and quickly left me. I then discovered QuickBooks WOULD NO LONGER work thanks to Microsoft. I further discovered they changed my default browser, and left three new programs installed on my machine that I do not want. Further, 36 new \"important updates\" started appearing with windows updater. QuickBooks absolutely would not reinstall or repair from the product DVD. Thank heavens for Revo Uninstaller. It cleaned up QuickBooks remnants enough for me to get it going again. It also removed the three leftover junk programs. Total lost billable time is over eight hours.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I am a relative beginner at CD writing, and i have been attempting to write onto CD's in various formats (audio, text, and image files) using the Nero Burning ROM 5.5.4.3 which came with my Artronix internal CD writer.  My computer is a Presario 5441 and I use Windows 98.\nI'm writing this review in the hope that others who have had the problems that i've had with Nero will tell Nero about it as well.  The main and preliminary problem with Nero is that they provide virtually no support for their product.  E-mails to support which are clearly and politely written and which include important questions about using Nero's product go unanswered.  On the rare occasions when i have been able to elicit a response from Nero, this response was inadequate.  For example, the support technician was answering the wrong question, and insisting that the software did not respond the way that it was in fact responding.  I had to hire an outside computer repair person (expensive) to come over and he managed to burn some files, so that i know that the product does work.\nIn fact, Nero probably works just fine for those who know quite a bit about cd writing already, but if you do not, don't expect Nero to answer any questions that may come up about the use of their products.  I understand that lack of adequate support may be a problem with other cd writing software as well, so if anyone can recommend a cd writing software provider that actually gives support, i'm sure i'm not the only one who'd like to hear about it.", "label": 0}

The technical support people at TLC are totally unhelpful. The only  suggestions they offer are the same as those printed in the \"read  me\" file. Quick Time 4.0 prevents this game from running, so you have  to downgrade to the Quick Time 3.0 version that is bundled with the game.  Since Quick Time 4 was part of my Windows system files (and not a separate  program file) you can imagine the headache messing with this caused. It is  absurd that The Learning Company expects a \"new\" game to require  a version of Quick Time that is no longer available and which has no  support. I spent hours adjusting our system to run the game and guess what?  IT IS AN AWFUL GAME. If I hadn't spent money and hours of my time  DOWNGRADING my computer it would be funny. The game is pasted together with  scenery from previous versions. Extremely poor game design, pitiful  graphics, and clunky gaming.

{"text": "I bought FrontPage 98 a few years ago probably for the same reason you're at this page now--I wanted to start making my own web pages, but I was intimidated by all the stuff I would have to learn.\nFrontPage is a great tool to get you started, but, if you talk to enough people, and you spend as time on the phone with tech support as I find I have to do because of problems related to FrontPage, you'll hear the same thing over and over again: FrontPage writes messy code, Dreamweaver does not.\nWhy? Well the answer is both simple and familiar: Microsoft, once again, has chosen to create its own set of standards rather than follow those 95% of the rest of the world uses. Consequently, all the \"extra stuff\" required behind the scenes to make FrontPage work is essentially incompatible with many other things.\nIn fact, I upgraded from FP 2000 because the latter had a major bug, a known issue, as they call it--it cannot upload large sites; it almost always gives some sort of error when doing so. Worse, you MUST use FP to upload; you cannot simply FTP your files as you can with other HTML generators.\nSo, I upgraded to FP 2002, and the upload problem was fixed, but more problems were created. My current web host and at least two other ones (two of which are the largest in the industry) have told me the same thing--they are not supporting FP 2002 yet because it is too buggy.\nFP's whole approach of editing your site \"live\" presents a couple of other problems as well. You will notice that when you work in FP, you are actually working on \"live\" pages; i.e., you are editing the very page that is on your web site. No big deal, you're thinking, right? Wrong. As buggy as it is, FP often messes up its functions or crashes, and you're stuck with a crazy page live on your web site. Dreamweaver, on the other hand, essentially duplicates your entire web site on your hard drive, and all editing takes place on your hard drive first. If something goes awry, you don't need to upload the changed pages from your hard drive to your web site--if worse comes to worse, you can choose to overwrite your local pages with the ones that are live on your site.\nAfter working for a long time in both editors, I have come to think of having TWO web sites when working with Dreamweaver; I can tinker with and tweak the one on my hard drive at will and, when it's just how I want it, I can upload it. In FP, I have no such option. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but imagine you had an electronic billboard that was visible to the world--wouldn't you want to upload the new one all at once instead of little by little? Part of the reason I'm writing this review right now is that I now, as I write, have one of those so-called \"known issues\" plaguing my web site. FP 2002 has a bug that causes certain parts of the page to duplicate itself. So, now, as I type, visitors are seeing my page in double!! I am SO tired of the whole FP deal. I am now sure that I will convert my entire site to Dreamweaver so that I can be done with FP forever!!\nFinally, FP uploads in a special way that is necessary for FP to function properly. From what I understand, FP uploads via the web while most editors do so via FTP. This may seem a small matter, but think of it this way--have you learned, the way I have, that you must save frequently? Probably. Do you hit CTRL+S (to save) between every other breath in most other programs? If so, you will quickly grow tired of FP. Each save takes from five to twenty minutes, no joke, and I have DSL. Dreamweaver, on the other hand, can upload a page in just a few seconds, always.\nI now realize that I should have just learned Dreamweaver in the beginning, and have a purely Dreamweaver site.

{"text": "I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.\n\n Well, before I pulled out my credit card at CompUSA, I asked the manager if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. \"No problem!\" he told me, \"It works great!\"\n\n NONSENSE!\n\n Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:\n 1. My touch pad stopped working.\n 2. My PCI bus started getting errors.\n 3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.\n\n And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!\n\n I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again. Six extremely frustrating hours!\n\n Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.\n\n Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After an hour arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the \"System Requirements\" on the box, and then I showed him what's in my laptop. According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible.\n\n Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, it says right on the box that the upgrade is designed for systems with Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition. Not only that, but I reminded him that I specifically said I was upgrading from Windows ME!!!\n\n I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.\n\n In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.\n\n Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system.", "label": 0}

As a result, it doesn't provide distance or time remaining or est time of arrival to destination or next turn.\n- Your car icon does not stay centered on the map until you reach the edge of the screen; annoying if your next turn is just off the screen.  Docs say it should but it doesn't work.\n- Map has a fixed orientation, North is always up.  It would nice if the map rotated based on on your direction of travel with the map always pointing ahead.\n- Minor point: color of car icon is too similar to map colors and makes it hard to see.\n- Minor: Not enough contrast in some map colors, roads are white and urban areas are light gray, thus hard to tell apart.  I guess So. CA. needs more parks and lakes.\n- GPS position wanders in hilly areas.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a very long review but I have endeavored to share what I have learned using SmartDraw since 2007 and the results of trying, but failing, to find a similar product.\n\n8/8/2012 UPDATE I have updated to the 2012 version of Smart Draw and am very happy with the changes. I have recently worked with floor plans, elevations, gardens, graphs, timelines and gantt charts. I was frustrated and finally gave up trying to make a timeline that was by quarter for 18 months. I did a workaround and the result was quite nice. The floor plan changes are very powerful. You can get into a lot of creativity or trouble. For example, depending on where you place your curser you end up with angled walls or you move the whole wall. It took me a bit of time to learn the precise location but it is a very nice option.\n\n2/9/2012 UPDATE I continue to use this program and appreciate the products it can produce. This last week I discovered a new thing it can do that I found extremely useful. There are times when you draw an object in another program, such as powerpoint, that blows apart when you try to move it. I discovered that you can take a copy of the graphic and plop it onto a blank page in Smart Draw and it copies as a picture. From there, save it as a sdr file, go back and so save as, and pick your image format--I usually use jpg. As with any sdr file, you can adjust the density and size of the image when you save it. This worked perfectly for me and when I imported the jpg into another program (in this case MS Word) it behaved perfectly. Of course, you can do the same thing with a photo editing program like PaintShop Pro or Photo Shop but this is quick and easy and if you already have the program open is it is quick and easy.\n\n9/10/2011 UPDATE I am currently working on a project that requires a great deal of data analysis. I typically have the same data i Exel, SPSS and sometimes in txt format. I am working with data with a large number of cases or smaller ones with many data points. I have to analyze the data, convert it into to a variety of visual formats and then save it as a 8MB or larger file for publication. I can graph in multiple programs. I typically move the data to SmartDraw the graphical presentation because it has the most control over the presentation of the data and is easy to convert to large jpg files. However, there are three things that are truly bothersome. As I and others have noted the program crashes a lot. My office partners are used to me throwing my hands into the air and rolling my chair back while I wait for the program to restart. On the positive side, when it does restart my stuff is still there. My computer should have enough power to run a program like this so I believe the \"crash-o--matic\" aspect of it is in the program. Secondly, it is hard to change the font size on graphs. You should be able to select one of the sibling boxes and change the text in all. While I can make this happen sometimes it is not reliable which necessitates changing box by box. That said, I still think it is a good program. Doing the sort of thing I do is not trivial so having to wrestle with a program is not uncommon regardless of the program I use. My criteria is whether or not the program will ultimately produce what I want. I can answer affirmatively that Smart Draw does that for me.\n\n7/24/2011 UPDATE I have been using VP for several months now and have changed my 5 to 4 stars. It is still a versatile program and allows you to do a lot of different things with only a little technical skill. However, I think the previous versions were easier to use when you wanted to do a range of different types of graphics. I have found that the libraries are harder to work in and it seems to me that there were things I used to use that are not there now. Of course, backwards memory is always risky but I think there were ;-). I would still buy this program, and I am glad that I have it. However, I strongly urge people to figure out what you want your program to do. As other reviewers have mentioned, Visio is better or that is better. I still believe that the \"better\" aspects are based on what you use the program for. I think Smart Draw is a very good choice if you use a lot of different types of graphics (e.g. brochures, charts, fliers, landscapes, etc). I do not think it is the best choice if you use one or a few types of graphics because there are limits and trade offs in usability to offer the range of modules.\n\n3/30/2011 ORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nTHE BASIS OF MY REVIEW\nSome reviewers cautioned that the highly ranked reviews were \"shill\" because people did not purchase the program through Amazon, and/or that they only had one review posted.  I cannot speak to those reviews but I can speak to my review. Upfront I will state that I did not purchase my copies from Amazon because I needed multiple seats and that was not available through Amazon.  I decided to review SmartDraw here since Amazon is a very important place to share product experiences. My review is based on frequent use of 2007, 2009 and recently with VP (2010).\n\nI routinely purchase from, and review products on, Amazon. I always try to write the type of review that provides information to help people decide if a product is one they will like. I am far from the most frequent or popular reviewer but I have a good track record on \"helpfulness\" votes.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I affirm that I have not received any economic or other benefits from SmartDraw.  I have no friends or family members who work for SmartDraw. This review is entirely my opinion.\n\nI LIKE SMARTDRAW VERY MUCH\nI think SmartDraw is a very good program and a good investment. I also think there are issues to consider. After thinking carefully of its pluses and minuses for me, I decided to give it a 5 star rating because in my opinion the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I have experienced a few limitations, some of which turn out to be lack of knowledge of the program, some that are idiosyncrasies of the program, some that are just unhelpful, and some that hopefully will fade with time. Having reviewed other programs, SmartDraw is the most versatile program of commercial or freeware that I have found. I am a researcher and being able to analyze data in various visual methods teaches me about my data and provides ways to show others what the data are saying. There is a problem with VP that I hope will fade away but have no assurance that it will. For reasons I do not understand, the SmartDraw company decided to create the new version (VP) so that it is not backwards compatible. This forces you to upgrade/purchase any seat that is using the images created or edited in VP. I have provided more detail below on all of my concerns. This has happened with other programs (e.g. transitioning from Word 3.0 to Word 1997) and fixes have followed. Hopefully there will be a fix and the problem will fade away.\n\nSome reviewers have said that Visio is better. As one reviewer correctly pointed out there is far more information available for book and community tech support than for SmartDraw. I agree that for some functions Visio is a great choice. However, there are things that SmartDraw does do that Visio does not. I used Visio in the past and know that it is a very powerful program. It did not meet my needs for the type of scientific data analysis and graphing that I do. By comparison, SmartDraw is probably not a good choice for company IT management like Visio is. I think it is important to consider what you want to do with a program and then match those needs to your software.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\nPROS\n1. Multiple Graphic/Visual Analysis Module In One Program\nSmartDraw is unique in that it combines multiple types of graphics in one program. SmartDraw is excellent for visual data analysis and creating graphics to display that data. I can be very good for planning and designing things like electrical systems, house plans, computer programs, and even landscaping. Perhaps the most important outcome of this multi-module design is that you can enter data once and then use it across multiple types data presentation. For example, you can put data in, display it in the graphing/charging functions and with one click display the exact data in the mind map module. I have been able to find programs that are alternatives to one or a few of the modules but none that work across so many modules. Additionally, when using multiple programs, linking them together is very time-consuming.\n\n2. Data Analysis, Not Just Data Presentation\nSmartDraw is not a just a graphics program. It is that, plus a data analytic tool. I use it in combination with a statistical program and it allows me to understand and display my data in ways I cannot with the statistical package alone.\n\n3. Helps Convey Complex Thoughts to Others\nSmartDraw allows me to construct graphic images to convey unusual or complex information to others.\n\n4. Can Create Very Dense Files for Publication\nYou can create very large, dense graphics that are excellent for publication. We often write monographs and reports that are done in color and on good paper. We need incredibly large images (3-8 MB each)to have the quality necessary for these publications and for scientific posters. It is quite easy to do this with SmartDraw once you figure it out. I have never found any program that is similar for data analysis. You can draw lovely graphics for publications but you can also display information in analytic methods.\n\nCONS\nWhile I have listed a lot of cons here, they are most important for casual users. For serious users, there are generally ones that can be chalked up to idiosyncratic program quirks. Like most program, these quirk are things you learn to work around but are sometimes things that are downright infuriating. In my experience, some of the problems I have had were related to needing a deep knowledge of the program so you can figure out how to do it or find a decent work-around. A couple of the cons are serious. I also agree totally with reviewer that said SmartDraw is not a good program for serious, competent graphics designers. SmartDraw is a combination of \"get it done\" and sophisticated options. You can really do a lot with things program but it probably is not a substitute full-bore, full time, graphics designs. It can be a great part of a larger toolkit.\n\n1. Advertised As \"Simple,\" But In Reality It Is Not A Program For Casual Users\nSmartDraw is a multi-competence level program that can be hard to use for more complex graphics. It is not for casual users unless you want to use a pre-packaged item and just fill in their blanks.\n\n2. Help Functions are Either Very Basic or Sometimes Hard To Find\nThe \"Smart Help\" feature is nice but the information provided is the very beginning level helpful to those who are \"filling in the blanks.\" Not unlike some other programs, finding advanced help can be frustrating because what SmartDraw calls a function is not always intuitive. Sometimes the information is not in the help files.\n\n3. Sometimes Overly Aggressively Automated\nThere are times that I cannot understand what is happening with with my graphic or how to enter and manage my data. The automated aspects of SmartDraw can be aggressive; it may reset parameters when you do not want it to do that. It can be tiresome to track these down so you can figure out what is amiss. This is improved in VP. The Gantt Chart module is an excellent example of the problem. Sometimes you set date parameters and SmartDraw \"fixes\" later dates by sending them to the default.\n\n4.  Sometimes Limits the Complexity of the Data You Can Display\nAt times the program will not accept the parameters I want to use. For example, top level and sublevels can be difficult to display and sometimes you cannot force the program to analyze and display sublevel data.\n\n5. Can Be Buggy\nSmartDraw can be buggy. You can be doing something and poof, the program shuts down. If you have good \"save\" habits, the crash is a bother, but usually not fatal. Sometimes it can be a bigger issue. The file may lose its association with SmartDraw even though the extension is actually on the file. As a result of the uncoupling, your files look like text files so you cannot easily spot them. If you can find the file you have to open SmartDraw, navigate to the file, and then open it. You cannot click on the file itself. It also disappears from all locations of \"recent docs\" so it appears to be completely gone even if it is there. A little experience and you can find the files but it can be baffling at first.\n\n6. No Backwards Compatibility (see more below).\nSmartDraw VP is not backwards compatible with previous versions.\n\nSMARTDRAW VP IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS\nIn a crisis moment, I ended up purchasing VP and *then* discovered that it was not backwards Not only had I created new images that could not be used on my other machines where I have 2009, I effectively destroyed my ability to access graphics that I had made minor changes on in VP. I do intend to upgrade all of my machines but for now cannot afford to do that so am stuck with a very difficult problem. I hope there is a fix soon.\n\nMOVING LICENSE FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER\nOne commenter pointed out you can be forced into purchasing a new version if you change computers. This can be a thorny problem. When I had these difficulties, I had the presence of mind to enlisted the help of SmartDraw tech support. I own two seats (one for desktop and one for laptop). I decommissioned my old desktop and then could not install SmartDraw on my new desktop since I was effectively requesting three seats. After we identified the problem, Tech Support canceled my registration for the decommissioned desktop which allowed me to install it on my new machine. My problem was solved in just a few minutes.\n\nTECH SUPPORT\nSome reviewers say that they have had problems with tech support. My own experience is that they have been very helpful and meet my criteria for really good support. I recognize that you do have to have the \"premium\" version to get the tech support I have. I have purchased \"premium\" tech support on other programs and have not been as satisfied as I am with SmartDraw. Here is why I like them:\n\n1. They answer the phone quickly and you get a real person.\n2. It is possible to understand the accents of the tech support personnel. I understand that English and Spanish language support is available.\n3. They listen patiently while you explain the issue and do not assume what it is or that you do not know what you are talking about.\n4. They stick with you while you try to solve the problem.\n5. They are downright honest in saying things like, \"Yes, it would be good if it did that but it does not.\"\n6. They will do phone support follow-up by email from a real person. Typically you can stay with the same tech support person through the resolution of a problem.\n\nUPDATE 3/31/2011\nI discovered today that since I bought the premium tech support package it includes upgrade \"protection\" so I get a free upgrade on VP. I was very happy that I purchased the premium package.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This product is fantastic for many reasons. Let me begin by saying that I have been studying Japanese already for six years on my own. So, being already learned from books and other software programs I was a bit hesitant to try another one and have to sit through the motions of basic Japanese BUT the way that they organize this software, it kind of lets you skip around so you're not sitting for hours through these boring automated lessons feverishly clicking the stuff you already know just so you can move on. Human Japanese is pretty open to the user so you can approach Japanese from whatever angle you want. I spent the first week with this software hitting the chapters I wanted to touch up on and found that their way of teaching is actually really comforting just like other reviewers have said.\n\nSo much in fact that I am now just going back over the stuff I 'already knew' and am constantly getting pleasantly surprised by the way that they explain those things. Like it makes even MORE sense now.\n\nThe writing style is calm with some mild jovial points that catch your attention, really it IS as if you are sitting there with a Japanese person and an American person, both fluent in the language and they are EXPLAINING it to you, point for point, making connections with English that really - I haven't even seen referenced in many books I own and I'm up to about 35. So as someone who has a growing horde of Japanese Language books, as someone who has sampled Rosetta Stone and as someone who gets confused easily coupled with NO attention span... this software is absolutely perfect for me. It's concise, gives examples, makes connections, doesn't overload you with rules and exceptions...\n\n... seriously. Everyone interested in learning Japanese at any level you may be now.

{"text": "If you are tired of getting viruses and adware, and constantly dealing with errors and crashes, Linux may be the answer you are looking for.\n\n- Ubuntu is cleaner, leaner, and more stable than Windows.  Program crashes are less frequent.  When programs do crash, they usually don't affect the rest of the OS.  You won't have junk files and registry errors to worry about, and viruses and adware are simply a non-issue.\n\n- The shear depth of options for both visual style and interface will simply blow your mind.  Right out of the box, Ubuntu has multitudes more customization than Windows has ever offered. Anything from the interface (system tray, task list, menus) can be moved and arranged anywhere.  Install Compiz Fusion and Emerald Theme Manager, and you'll expand your options even more.  You can literally trick out your whole operating system like a car in Need for Speed.\n\n- Many of the popular visual effects and tools from Mac OS X actually originated in Linux.  You can have multiple desktops (Spaces), view all open windows (Expose), and even have a widget layer (Dashboard).  *Some of this requires Compiz Fusion.\n\n- Installation of thousands of free software packages is a breeze using either of the 2 included \"package managers.\"  You simply check off all the programs you want to install (and uncheck programs to uninstall), then hit OK and Ubuntu does everything for you.  An array of additional packages are available for download, and can usually be installed easily with a .deb installer.  Popular commercial software such as Skype, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR, Google Picasa, Google Earth, and other great programs are available for Linux too.\n\n- The WINE program allows you to install and run many windows programs.\n\nHaving said all these great things, there are a few drawbacks.  There may come times where you do (unfortunately) need to run a specific Windows program that does not work in WINE.  You may want to leave windows installed alongside Ubuntu (dual-boot) so you have the option of falling back to it when absolutely necessary.\n\nDON'T BUY IT JUST YET!\n\nThere are several ways to get Ubuntu, and buying it from here may not best one for you.  Consider this:\n\n- Ubuntu is a FREE download from [...].  When you buy this item on Amazon, you are paying for the physical disc and box, and for the convenience of having it all ready to install.\n\n- If you are looking for a new computer, consider that some new computers have the option of getting Ubuntu pre-installed.

{"text": "Pajama Sam is back! I bought this after reading most of the reviews below. I have to say is that they are mostly all true. Technically this game is in beta but the game play is still good if you can close your eyes to the technical snafus. The voice sync is awful, the game runs slowly (this is inexcusable with at animated cartoon type game) and it takes a minimum of 160MB on the hard drive. If Humongous could make their early DOS games run well why can't Atari do the same with game on toady's faster computers? Sounds like they wanted to get this thing out for the Christmas season. The voice does sound different. Weather it's the same kid but older or a different kid is difficult to tell but they game does lose something because of it.\n\nOn the plus side the game is still fun to play. Pajama Sam is still the cleaver, mischievous kid as he's always been. Although I wish Atari didn't have a hand in this (their quality standards seem to be a lot lower that Humongous' standards) I'm glad we have another Pajama Sam game. Hopefully a patch will be issued for this game and that will bring this game back up to Humongous' standards for the technical issues.", "label": 2}

For example, it doesn't work with the mouse-scroll button, and double-clicking on some items doesn't bring the user to where he wants to go.  Also, when I tried to update from within the program, it crashed; I downloaded the update from their website.\nMy biggest complain for this year is a pernicious bug in the computation of AMT (Form 6251, line 16), after the first update.  TaxCut erroneously adds the capital-loss carryover as a positive adjustment in AMT.  That means (if I trust the results) I would have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes for my *losses*.  I noticed this bug because the pre- and post-update results differ by a huge amount.  (See the USENET for similar experiences from other users.)  I temporarily override line 16 with \"0\".\nCustomer service is essentially nonexistent.  When I complained about the bug, the service representative was clueless.

In my opinion, Quicken 2002 is not even in the same league as Microsoft Money 2002.  I put it through the paces and it fell short in every test.  My online broker offered full OFX connectivity vs. downloaded QIF files and so I decided to use Quicken to download my transactions.  For my mutual fund accounts, I couldn't pick the default cost-basis method of first-in-first-out  Instead, Quicken made me select cost basis for every one of my 130 mutual fund transactions.  Money prompted me the first time for cost-basis and asks me if I wanted to make that choice my permanent selection.  Money just made it a lot easy for me to import all of the transactions from my broker.\nMy overall impressions is that Quicken has kept its interface clunky and ugly to keep the old Quicken users happy while Microsoft not having the legacy issue has created a very nice user interface that is actually intuitive and just simply works better.

{"text": "This product has a unique approach to flow charting and when it works it is fast and fluid and beats Visio hands down. The mind mapping works great and is one of the best charts and really shows off what Smart Draw can do. However this is the exception not the norm. I bought it for use in creating diagrams for computer system and software engineering, creating a time line and flowchart for a book I'm working on, and for event flow charts in role-playing adventures.\nThe book I'm working on is a fantasy world and uses fantasy dates (1000 - 1200, etc). Unfortunately the lowest year you can \"customize\" is 1971. Quite frequently when you add another event to the timeline only the black handles appear instead of the full event box. You have to add another event to clear the artifact and see the actual event. If you open the sample Police report by Hour and try and change any of the times on any of events the entire chart will disappear. Or if you switch the Timeline format to Auto from Hourly, it'll create a very vertical time line. Switching back to hourly and you will be presented with a timeline and no events.\nOne of the most frustrating things about creating a flow chart is once you use auto charting either by using ctrl + arrow key or using the GUI you can't turn off snapping to that symbol. Any library symbols you drag near that symbol will attempt to auto snap. If you never use the auto charting then you can freely drop items onto the canvas and on top of other symbols. For the most part auto snapping is preferred as it is Smart Draw's main feature that differentiates it. However I was attempting to create a Post/Postback flowchart; which shows how the information flows from the client to the server and back again in web development. I wanted two small flowcharts in parallel to show this process. I ended up having to drop each flow chart symbol on the canvas and then after everything was in place take the line tool to draw a connection point in between each item. At this point, I was by passing the main reason I bought the software. This isn't very intuitive and is invasive to my workflow.\nThere are other visual bugs such as when you want to resize a symbol and keep the aspect ratio. You do this by holding down the shift key and dragging the handles. It works fine until a symbol is attached to another symbol by a line. When you attempt to resize in this scenario, the object will begin flashing yellow and very quickly jump from the size you want to the original size. This is very distracting and something you would expect to see in beta code but not release quality. It does resize correctly.\nYou can change the way symbols are sized by editing the symbol in the SmartPanel or Library. You can specify Use Fixed Size, Scale to Ruler Settings, or manually change but you can't do it for the entire library. There is no way to create a custom symbol list i.e. symbol palette.  Instead you have to switch in between the out of the box symbol libraries (which is a solid list).\nAnother annoying issue is that the undo does not work on the Ink functionality; it's a completely separate mechanism to the rest of the program.\nIf you do decide to buy, get the physical media. At $197 dollars for the software and $49.95 to be able to re-download it for a year it's too much. With Visual Studio Standard coming in at less than $200.00 it's the better value.\nThe product has so much potential I really hope Smart Draw fixes the issues and adds some enhancements to increase workflow with the next version. Ultimately they sold me on the idea of the Visual Processor because it's a cool concept. However the execution really falls short. I've spent more time fighting with the Visual Processor than being productive and this is why I can't recommend the product.", "label": 0}

{"text": "It's hard for me to overstate the help I've gotten from this program in learning Japanese. I'm someone who has never done well with languages in a classroom setting. For some reason, my brain doesn't seem to jive well with the way most foreign language teachers teach. Nothing sinks in, concepts don't 'click', and  after I somehow pass the class, I forget everything.\n\nThat's what nearly happened when I took Japanese 100 in college last semester. The class would simply whizz by while I can honestly say I learned next to nothing. Finally, the week of finals, I decided I needed to do something to get up to speed so I'd pass. I used Human Japanese for a few days and learned more than I did during the whole semester. Not only that, but the program helped me to realize just how simple some of the concepts were.\n\nWhile textbooks tend to describe things in technical-speak that would confuse my understanding even of my native language, Human Japanese does what the name suggests and what the developer promises: it explains Japanese in a personal, human way that does wonders for teaching the new language to someone. I can't tell you how many times I finished learning a new concept and was surprised at just how simple it had been. This program inspires confidence in your ability to learn Japanese. It doesn't take off and leave you in the dust anywhere, ever.\n\nWe use Rosetta Stone at school, and I literally hate the program. Never mind its price, Human Japanese is a far superior program for learning the basics of Japanese. The fact that it's much, much more affordable is a huge bonus. Keep in mind, Human Japanese has just released a follow-up program called Human Japanese Intermediate for people who have finished the original and want to delve further into the language.

{"text": "I just got the Monopoly Casino Vegas Edition yesterday. It includes the ususals: Craps, Roulette, Poker, Video Poker, Keno, Slots- and they added Bingo, Sic-Bo, Money Wheel, and Video Slots.\nBingo is lots of fun. Poker is also pretty good. Video Poker is a bit bland, but playable. Keno translates pretty well- they removed the original Keno machine they used in the original Monopoly Casino and now a regular number board.\nNow, the not so good news. Roulette limits you to only $500 at any table. While the Craps game in the original Monopoly Casino was very fun, they now made the layout into some techno-metal thing. After every roll, the board lights up with winning bets in green and losing bets in red which gets very annoying. And you get hardly any time to see what the dice landed on. However, there is a big glitch in Sic-Bo and Money Wheel. Whatever the table limits are, is what they think the maximum winnings is. So therefore, if the table limit was $5-$500 and you bet $100 on 10-to-1, they would make you take it off since you could win $1000.\nNow, the slots. To my dismay, there are no Vegas Monopoly slots. There are regular slot machines just with Monopoly icons on the reels, and that's their excuse for Monopoly Slots. Also, the 3 Video Slots are spins on Battleship, Clue, and I think Milles Borne. They're fun, but I'd rather see Monopoly slots.\nThe atmosphere has improved from the original version, it looks more like Vegas. Also, you don't hear Mr. Monopoly anywhere, he's been replaced by regular dealers. Also, in the original version a whole bunch of bells and whistles would go off when you won, while in this version you have no clue if you won or lost. They don't even say as much as \"Winner\". Nothing at all.\nOverall, this is an OK game, but you're better off shopping around for some other game if you want a really good game.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is our third version of Microsoft FrontPage.  We started with FrontPage 98, upgraded to FrontPage 2000, and have just moved to FrontPage 2002.  Unfortunately, we are not convinced that this product is any better than the last version.\nTo give you an idea of how much we use FrontPage -- we have been told by both Microsoft engineers and our Web hosting company that our OfficeLinks.com web site is one of the largest that they have ever seen published with FrontPage. It currently exceeds 5,000 pages.  However, it has become virtually impossible to update the shared borders that we utilize throughout the root web.  It took our web hosting company 1.5hrs, using direct server commands, to recalculate all of our hyperlinks!  We don't blame all of this on Microsoft, since we should have used sub-webs more - however, Microsoft may want to prevent (or warn) users not to include more than 100 pages in any web, or sub-web.\nAdditionally, there are two real problems from our perspective that have appeared in the latest version of FrontPage. (1st) First, it is no longer possible to copy hyperlinks into the \"Insert Hyperlink\" text box.  The right mouse button seems to be disabled.  This makes adding hyperlinks directly much more difficult - We now have to add a dummy hyperlink and then go into the HTML code and do a \"paste shortcut\" - this adds a few extra steps every time we want to add or update hyperlinks.\n(2nd) The second real problem, which others have also identified on this board, is the way the underlying HTML code is generated.  FrontPage seems to add little things like <span> when you are working in the WYSIWYG Editor to the underlying HTML code.  This is so poor that you actually start to get spelling mistakes when you are re-working pages.  We now have to check the underlying HTML code on every page, which almost makes the WYSIWYG editor useless.\nThere has been one real improvement with FrontPage 2002 that we would also like to point out.  You now have the ability to publish individual pages directly to your Web site.  This is a big improvement, since it doesn't take OfficeLinks 30 minutes to make a change any more.  Individual page changes can be made rapidly.\nWe have so much invested in this program, that we are not ready to switch to another program just yet, but if some of these issues are not addressed before the next full upgrade, we may consider moving to a new platform.\nWe can't really call the latest version of FrontPage an upgrade, since some of the features and functions have actually gotten worse.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Before I start, let me state I've been a computer techie for the last 20+ years.  When I first started Windows was only a dream and you had your choice of DOS and IBM compatible (both of which were really the same thing in the broadest definition).\n\nNeedless to say, things have changed slightly.  You now have Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux with DOS still hanging on for dear life (and  if you're a real techie, try UNIX).\n\nI gave up on Windows when Vista came out and although I like OS X, Apple's stranglehold on computers running their OS has made that proposition a tad expensive.\n\nEnter Linux, the poor man's Windows.  Yes, you can get a thousand different flavors but Ubuntu is probably one of the best (along with Suse) for each of use.\n\nFor example:\n\n*  I recently had a computer which had Vista installed.  Something corrupted the OS and the manufacturer was nice enough to send me an install disk when their built in rescue partition failed.  After 4 hours of waiting and answering numerous inane questions I finally had my computer back once I popped in the installation disk.  The only problem was it no longer recognized the video and sound cards nor would it acknowledge the wireless card.  I downloaded the necessary drivers from the manufacturer only to have Vista reject them.  After a few more hours of tweaking and just about losing my religion I finally got things working.  That lasted about two weeks before the OS got funky again and started losing programs such as Quicken and the final straw was when it couldn't find my printer even though it was right there in the printers dialog box.\n\n*  As luck would have it, I have ordered an Ubuntu disk from the manufacturer and had just received it.  From the time I popped it in until the time it was ready took roughly 20 minutes.  Yes, 20 minutes!  It not only recognized my NVIDIA video card and Broadcom wireless card it even downloaded the drivers to make sure both worked.  I then tempted fate and plugged in my Samsung USB laser printer.  Nothing happened, or so I thought.  Upon looking I realized it had found the printer and had already installed it!  Took all of about 5 seconds!\n\nFor those of you who are afraid to abandon Windows for Ubuntu you can go two ways -- the live CD or merely tell Ubuntu to partition the disk so you can still keep Windows.  Simple as that!\n\nBy the way, you have to option to install a bazillion free programs (actually closer to 5,000), many of which emulate comparable Windows programs.  You'd probably spend closer to $50,000 to get the similar Windows programs.\n\nSo, do the math.  You can pay $12 for this DVD (or get it free from the developer) or you can pay $100 to $300 for Windows Vista or $129 or so for Mac OS X (although you'll have to shell out another $1,000 or so for the Apple computer to go along with the latter OS).", "label": 1}

Mapsource has the old number -- leading me to wonder how current the data is. (2) Too little detail to be useful.  For instance there is a bike trail that runs from Valley Forge Park all the way to the Art Museum in Philadelphia.  I have ridden it a zillion times. For the life of me I cannot find it on the map -- even on the PC screen.

I have been told that the Natl Geo maps have the detail you need.  You can't download the maps to the GPS, but at least the maps themselves are useful.

For someone to compare this favorably to RS is highly suspicious to me.  After multiple failed attempts to get this product to work on my Mac, I went to a PC laptop to actually check it out.  This product compares to Rosetta Stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak.  This is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list.  Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone.  My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary.  So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS.  The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing.  It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair.  They should take those claims off of their packaging.

Neither does TaxCut. It's a toll number as well.\nThe main problem I had with TaxCut was in importing information\nfrom Quicken 2002. All the information got there, but it was\nnot properly separated, the way it had been in TurboTax:\nMultiple charitable donations were all lumped together, and the\norganization names were not imported- last years were used,\nand were all empty except for the top one, where the total\nwas put.\nMore important, earning information from two employers was\nlumped under one W2. This had implications for excess FICA.\nWhen I called tech support, I was told the obvious- \"you have\nto enter the information in by hand to two separate W2 forms\".\nAnd \"we have no plans to fix this\". So, that's tech support,\nand import compatibility with Quicken, TaxCut style.\nIn general, navigation from numbers to the sources of those\nnumbers (forms, worksheets, etc.) is better with TurboTax\nthan it is with TaxCut.\nAll that said, it's still worth using a slightly inferior\nproduct if TurboTax is going to insist on installing SpyWare\non my computer.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Pinnacle Studio 8 is a good program with hints of greatness. There are a lot of nice features and its ease of use is currently unmatched. However, the program is not without its programming flaws.\nStudio 8 is easy to install. Basically, put in the requested disks, wait and you are done. Some systems may need to reboot afterwards but after that, you are ready to roll.\nCapturing, editing and rendering are all simple to do and you can have a lot of fun doing so. Making cuts and edits were surprisingly simple and the effects that you can add are truly impressive. Rendering, while easy, is very slow, even on the fastest systems. An hour of video rendered for DVD took nearly 7 hours to render. That may be kind of slow compared to higher end systems but if you have the time, it is worth it. The end product, while sometimes showing SOME red bleed, looks very nice.\nOn a major down point, this program is quite temperamental. You pretty much have to make sure it is the ONLY program you run after a reboot. If you run other programs before going into Studio 8, chances of a crash are high. When scrolling text, I will often get these unknown TITLEDEKO errors that Pinnacle has yet to offer suggestions or fixes about. It has a sometimes-nasty habit of simply 'resetting' your PC and causes it to reboot.\nI capture with Pinnacles' AV/DV PCI card. It does a good job but I sometimes have audio sync issues and I have yet to find out if it is the card or the software.\nPinnacle's support is fair but featues a great, mostly user supported, webboard. However, you may be scared from purchasing this software because of all of the issues people have.\nThis is a great program with a lot of good features and special effects. You will need to make sure you turn off all of those \"cute\" programs like screen savers, mouse enhancements, backgrounds and other memory resident programs to make sure you do not crash. It will work for you if you follow these directions but let's hope 9.0 will be more stable.", "label": 2}

This seems to be an attempt to parallel Dreamweaver, but there's no apparent way to turn if off and on.\nThe BG sound is greyed out most of the time - this seems to be a bug.\nAfter saving changes to a page and closing it, sometimes when you return later, the latest save is gone and it has reverted to the former version! Not exactly a time saver!\nThere is now no way to set the amount of compression that FP applies to jpg images - unlike before when you could 'undo' the compression in the properties menu.\nPage margins have to be manually entered into the HTML before the 'margins' tab shows up in the Page Properties dialogue box (this was also a problem with FP2000)\nThe image preview has been removed from the image dialogue box To make matters worse, instead of staying within the web that you are currently working on, the image dialogue opens into the image folder where you last visited. This is particularly slow if you have many webs on your hard drive, as you have to re-navigate.\nSo far those are the major complaints. They do have some new features that are interesting, such as the ability to add in-line frames, and a few other more sophisticated features.  It would have been nice to see expanded DHTML choices, and additional 'hover buttons' - maybe FP2005!", "label": 2}

I need to be able to view accurate and complete topographic maps, plot my tracks and markers on these maps, and orient locations by legal description -- Township, Range, and Section line -- so that I know, for instance, when I'm crossing property lines, say from public to private land.\nMapsource's topo maps have few contour lines and omit many dirt roads, small lakes, and many other details. Most importantly, Township, range and section lines are omitted. In it's favor, Mapsource is easy to use. And the price is good: The entire U.S. for $100.\nI later obtained MapTech's Terrain Navigator software, and it works much better for me. The details are almost as complete as USGS topo maps. Township, range and section lines are included, as are complete contour lines and even some abandoned, bermed roads (on public land). MapTech is not, however, as intuitive as Mapsource.

Even though some of the games were tedious (which my son needed) and at times right down frustrating for my son, he still enjoyed playing and was willing to go back to them.  The real gain for my son is that he learned he has to focus hard on tasks that are more difficult, and that it is impossible to get a job done (get points) if he did not hear instructions.  He also learned to recognize when he did not hear instructions, and that in those situations he should ask for instructions to be repeated (there is a speaker button to click in order to hear instructions repeated).

{"text": "I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I'll lose all of my files and projects that I've spent a long time working on. One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\n\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\n\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\n\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This thing worked fine for a long time. I bought my laptop used and  the old owner reported no glitches with Windows ME. But then I started having major, major problems. My computer would not shut off properly. It gave me the blue-screen of death, as SEVERAL tech consultantst called it. It also wouldn't allow me to install software without an uphill battle.  I was new to computers and hadn't heard the term \"firewall\". So when I finally got a clue, I bought the Norton Personal Firewall 2004 (very good by the way, my next item on the list of things to review here). Well, it wouldn't install. The old owner (a family friend) said he could install it while I did something else. It took HIM (my free consultant) about five hours to put it on. I thought that it might just be a problem with the software but that problem was not a one-time thing. When I finally upgraded to XP, it went on in 15 minutes tops as did everything else that needed to be installed. XP is so much better. ME is a waste of your money.\n\nI'm only giving it 2 generous stars because it worked well for several months before it went bonkers. Oh yes and if you upgrade to XP, make sure to get Service Pack 2, that has a firewall on it already. It's not a really good one (and I would recommend adding Norton or Zone alarm to the Windows firewall) but it's better than the nothing that you get with ME!", "label": 0}

So download the apps first then log in, why waste one of the key codes if you don't need to. It may tell you that its not compatible with the iPad but it is. If you need access any document save it to to your onedrive, and you can access on the go from any Internet. Its like having all that you may need while not in front of you. Last I looked Microsoft sells it for twice the price online and in retail stores. It does require a renewal at the end of your year, so you can choose to auto renew and enter credit card or Microsoft will send you an email when its time to renew.  Also, if you need to put it on another PC just deactivate one by logging in to your Microsoft account you can add it to another PC but this can only be done once every 90 days. So let's say you have it on a personal PC that your child is using for college and they no longer need it, deactivate it and you have another one to use on another PC.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I bought the retail boxed version of Viruscan 6.0 and was very unimpressed with it initially.  It required almost 2 hours of update downloading just to get it up to date.  Then I noticed the occasional freeze/lock up and slower web browsing.\nWhat's most maddening is the useless auto update utility.  Sure, it will download your updates, but it doesn't tell you how many files or the approximate time it needs!  You just get a progressive progress bar that gradually fills up as updates, files and patches are downloaded to your PC.  To it's credit, the downloads are installed automatically and it does a good job with what it's supposed to do, but my final update seemed to go on forever as it received dozens of tiny files to presumably update my virus definitions with no visual indicator as to how many more of these were left to install!\nKnowing that I had installed it on my IBM Thinkpad using the recommended installation was my first clue that this was the major problem.  To fix it, I disabled the intrusive Macaffee Firewall and turned off the Guardian app (and prevented them from activating boot up).  This solved many of the speed issues...besides, you more than likely bought this package for the ANTIVIRUS utility..if you want a firewall you'd go with BlackICE or something better.\nI still get the occassional freeze here and there so there's obviously something I can tweak or configure further to hopefully eliminate this problem.  I'll go on record as to say that my Thinkpad never crashed under Win98 before I installed Viruscan.\nWhat can I offer to the prospective Viruscan 6 buyer?  Install it using Custom Install.  DO NOT install the Firewall option (and leave out the Guardian app if at all possible).  UPDATE IT REGULARLY.  Disable what you don't need.  Face it, virusscanning and cleaning is all we really need when we buy something like this.  Would I recommend it over Norton AV 2002?  That's a tough call, but if properly configured, I'd say yes.  It's cheaper and less intrusive than Norton.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I think Norton's new AntiVirus beats McAfee for one reason:  It doesn't bog down the CPU.  You can run builds and keep NAV enabled and it doesn't slow you down significantly like McAfee does.\nOne problem with NAV that I've found is that it does not seem to repair the Nimbda virus.  It found the virus embedded in some zip files, though, so that may have been a special case.  I can't say if it can repair executables or not -- it probably can.  But I think McAfee is generally more comprehensive than NAV in repairing viruses, but it's not worth it if it's going to bog down your system...for me.\nOne problem with all of the reviews on this page is that none of these people had an actual virus to test the product with before they wrote in a good or bad review.  I HAD the Nimdba virus, and ran NAV..it simply quarantined the file.  And I have McAfee 4.5 on my system at work.  McAfee can definitely repair executables.

Imagine my diappointment when I found that not only were there no new encoders, but Roxio removed AudioCentral from the product completely!  You now have to use the \"Creator Classic\" interface to rip audio tracks from CDs.  There's just one problem--the data retrieved from the database is read-only.  You can't update the Gracenote database if it gives back bogus data.  I didn't see any way to edit the track tags either, but maybe I just missed it.\nAnother thing I noticed right off the bat is that the application forces you to run in 1024x768 mode.  My mom's eyes can't handle that resolution, so I had to remove it from her computer and put 6 back.\nIn short, stick with version 6 if you need something for managing your MP3s.

I also have previously worked for Broderbund providing technical support for their genealogy products, which included Family Tree Maker and Family Origins at that time.  I am now a programmer in my own right so I do understand the development cycle to a degree.\n\nIn all of this time Rootsmagic has internally became a much better and stronger program.  Unfortunately the one thing that has not gotten better or more powerful is the user interface.  I laugh when I read a review saying Rootsmagic intuitive to use and learn.\n\nSay you are a new user, you have managed to create a blank data base and now the time has come to enter people.  By default your blank database is showing a pedigree chart.  A normal person would click on the chart and expect to be able to start typing.  This does not happen.  Ok, so at the top of the pedigree chart are 4 lines, the first blank, the other three have b:, m: and d:.  It doesn't take much to think that this must be where you enter a person, so an unsuspecting user clicks in this area and nothing happens.\n\nThen and only then do your eyes continue up to the row of buttons and the menubar, because by now you are beginning to get desperate enough to look for the Help option.  On the button bar and on the menubar you see an option called 'add' and 'Add' respectively.  Bingo!  A file begins.  Then the adventure begins when you want to begin adding facts for your newly entered individual...dialog boxes galore.\n\nCompare this with other prgrams like Family Tree Maker where you click in a box and start typing your first person, then tab to the spouse box and continue typing, then to the children etc.  In a timed test, entering the same 50 individuals with only birth, death and marriage facts, using FTM and RM, I can enter individuals at about 4.5:1, and I know the program.\n\nRootsMagic is probably not the best choice for a newbie genealogist to use unless they have many years of computer usage under their belt.  I recently read a book called \"Why Software Sucks...\" by David Platt.  One point that he harped on was ease of use.  He says over and over to developers, \"know thy user, he is not you\".  What seems easy and intuitive to we programmers is not always so to our users.  If we do not provide what the user needs (within reason), they will find and use a product that does, which may be why FTM claims to be the #1 selling genealogy product of all time.\n\nOver all the program has a gazillion strong points, and about one bad point, which is why I have used it for so long.", "label": 2}

Their solution was to enter the old data for the previous year transaction by transaction.\nAfter almost six months of using the \"upgrade\" I've run into one bug after the other. Data mysteriously disappears and reappears. Statements that I thought had been reconciled correctly turn out to be incorrect when subsequent statements are reconciled. The program crashes on both NT (an iron horse of an operating system) and 2000. I'm constantly prompted to synchronize with Quicken.com even though I've synchronized. I won't even talk about the amount of advertising built into the product.\nAnd that brings me to the last item. One would think that with the amount of advertising and promotion built into the program that Intuit could provide at least a basic level of techinical support for what is an unbelievably buggy program. Their support can only be described as shameful. SHAMEFUL. It feels downright scammy when you call. Even the agents are often embarrassed by their system.\nThere was a time when Quicken was a great product with great service. I guess that now that it has a stranglehold on the personal financial software market we can look forward to even more dreadful customer service. Thank God for Amazon because I thought I was the only one having this kind of trouble.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Even though Windows XP has an annoying soccermomish look to it, it does have some nice \"under-the-hood\" features that power users and developers will like: specifically multiple simultaneous logins (ahem... finally 1970's technology arrives at Microsoft) and permissions for registry keys.\nThat said, the \"creamy\" GUI just remind me how Windows XP is a sad attempt to duplicate the OS X experience, though nowhere near as satisfying. Good news? You can turn it off and enjoy classic 2000ish look. Bad news? If you disable the annoying \"clickable\" login screen, you no longer get multiple login (\"switch user\") ability.\nMultimedia-wise, XP seems to be more tolerant towards mm devices, much more so than 2000. It is perhaps for this reason that it will often crash, for the stupidest reasons (for me, it does so when I insert any audio CD and try to have Winamp play it). In general, it seems rather intolerant towards anything not manufactured in the last 2-3 years (sorry!)\nI'm glad I still have my copy of Windows 2000 around (still the best version of Windows). I've yet to see an OS that recovers from crashes more gracefully, or gives the user more control. However, if you want a Mac OS X throwback (I like OS X, but dislike Apple's tendency to automatically assume all users are blithering idiots), go with XP. At least it looks nice.

{"text": "I'm an Artist / Animator not a programmer.\nI tried learning C++, Java, Unreal Script. No matter how hard I try, I just can't learn it. When I heard there was a 3D game engine around which uses a derivitave of BASIC as the core language, I can't tell you how psyched I was.\nSo I went to the DarkBasic website and they have DarkBasic, which is cheap, and DarkBasic Professional, which is a bit more, so I figured I'd check out the basic package and start simple.\nFirst thing you find is that there is no real How To Use This Product. There is a help feature of sorts, but code examples are of the cribnote variety: they are not actual working code examples but syntactical representations of code. A college professor with knowledge of basic computer science could decipher it. But if no one has taken the time to explain to you what an X and Y coordinate is, for instance, how are you going to know that X and Y means insert numbers here?\nFortunately I did know a bit about BASIC from my old Commodore 64 days, but even so, couldn't make anything happen till going to the homepage for tutorials. There are a couple on the main page. If you follow the first tutorial, you can toss together a few basic elements into a rudimentary first person shooter game. However I didn't want to make yet another of way too many first person shooter games. I have other game ideas.\nSo I go in search of more tutorials and there is a mere smattering of unfinished references around. Fortunately, a friend of mine loans me the 750 page book: Beginner's Guide to DarkBasic Programming. Unfortunately, if you took away all the author's attempts to impress you with his knowledge of computer science, it boils down to maybe 20 pages of actual content. (On page 48 they're still explaining how to install the software.)\nAfter getting my hands on what useless tidbit's I could find about as far as documentation, I was starting to get the understanding of how it worked, but still needed fuel for the fire. I marched down to the library and checked out every book on Liberty Basic, GWBasic, Microsoft Basic, etc, and starting translating the beginner's examples into DB. Now I was finally able to make some headway! Before long I was manipulating 3D game content around like I'd been doing it all my life.\nI started finding a few bugs here and there, then come to find out, they are no longer doing any updates to DarkBasic 1. It's obsolete. So I got the DarkBasic Professional Demo.\nFirst of all there are some problems with the Editor. It's incomplete. Apparently the guy who was working on that part left the company due to \"personal differences\" and left them without the source code, so any problems there cannot be fixed.\n[...]\nI would give this 6 stars on concept alone.\nHowever the the implementaion leaves much to be desired.\nFor documentation, they get a big fat ZERO\n\nI think this product has a tremendous amount of potential if they would just finish what they started before moving on to another project. They could easily have one of the premiere game authoring platforms if they would just get back on track with their core BASIC engine and stop trying to follow in the footsteps of HalfLife and Unreal Tournament", "label": 2}

{"text": "The thing I like most about Dramatica Pro is that it asks some very good questions about your characters, plot and settings, forcing you to think about those issues thoroughly. Of course, one could also just get the book and derive the same ideas from there, but the strength of the program is that it automatically relates those elements in a fairly consistent manner. The drawback is that at some point it reaches almost ridiculous levels of detail, leaving you just to fill in the scenes. For me this doesn't work at all, since I like to change my plot around as I go, so I usually stop at a higher level. But by then I generally have a much better idea of the direction of the story than before.\n\nThe interface is fairly crummy for this day and age. I would have liked better text editors, for one, since writing long descriptions tends to be a tedious affair in those little text boxes with that tiny, unchangeable font.\n\nSo all in all I think it's a good idea if for the elaborate questionnaire alone, but only for that it is perhaps a bit overpriced.", "label": 2}

This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors' daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}\n\nINITIAL SCORE: 93\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nLinda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really don't get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues?\nI still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.\n\nJane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didn't know how to take that...\n\nMrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.\n\nNigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.

I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.\n\nNed Nickerson : Supportive as always.\n\nLoulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. \"We are going to need a bigger boat.\" only goes so far after the 12th time heard.\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89\n\nSCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:\nOne of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date!

So many areas of the manor were majestically done!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93\n\nPUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didn't short-cut with a walkthrough [didn't cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask \" Do you have any SPY-dehs??\" in her english accent. :) Go Dig!\n\nCUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94\n\nADVENTURE ENDING: Now I don't mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesn't equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player.\n1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE\n2) Could Linda's ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No!\n3) What became of Linda except \"the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together\". I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward.\n4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours]\n5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?\n\nCUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84\n\n* PART 2 *\n\nI try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to\ntake weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself a\nDetective Score Of : 56\n\nMy Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldn't the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.\n\nMy Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.\n\nOVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]\n\nBOTTOMLINE: I'll not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why. Should I just accept \"Because the culprit enjoyed lying\"?\n\nThus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, BLACKMOOR ranks.....# 18\n\n1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5\n2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87\n3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5\n4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5\n5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84\n6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83\n7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5\n8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81\n9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80\n10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78\n11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5\n12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77\n13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76\n14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72\n15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5\n16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71\n17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5\n18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70\n19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5\n20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69\n21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68", "label": 2}

{"text": "I don't write a lot of bad reviews. I am a pretty easygoing person and I rarely can't get along with a product. I wouldn't really say that about Windows 98.\n\nFirst, Microsoft had to release a patch that made Windows 98 shut down slower because it was issuing the power off command before some hard drives could park. I think this should have been fixed in the alpha stage and is pretty embarrassing.\n\nThe next problem is that it needs a driver for EVERYTHING. Windows 98 supports pretty large hard disk sizes without problems in my experience. So the question is why isn't there a decent driver library right out of the box like ANY OTHER version of Windows. This is a big PITA because NOTHING plug and play works -- ever.\n\nDell released a generic USB stack for NT 4.0 and it works natively with any flash drive on the market with full hot swap-ability.\n\nGames run on Windows 98 but nothing else. Not a lot of web browsers like 98 and not a whole lot of non-MS programs like it either. Almost any period specific game will -- kind of like a power drill that can only spin a desk fan: who cares?\n\nThere is no 'sweet platform'. Windows 95 runs like a top on a 486 or a Pentium 1. Windows NT runs like a bandit on a Pentium III. Windows XP runs great on an AMD Sempron, or Pentium M (everything runs like a scalded cat on a Pentium M) and Windows 7 runs perfect on a Pentium D. Windows 98 just didn't get the freaking memo. I have never found a computer that 98 really agreed with -- the crappy ACPI support caused problems on AMD anything and Pentium III and later. Pentium II and before were too slow. Windows 98 is just the odd man out.\n\nThe 'upgrade' Windows ME introduces a lot of cool features, but is a buggy mess. The best thing to do is stick with the NT series (4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8) and don't look back at the DOS versions unless you want 95 or 3.11", "label": 0}

{"text": "The present progressive tense indicates that the action is in progress, e.g. I am eating (now).  In Spanish the present progressive tense is quite restricted and is usually limited to what a person is doing RIGHT NOW. Unfortunately, this course uses the progressive tense throughout, where as in real life, the present indicative is usually the tense most commonly used. Some examples from the course might be: Los muchachos estn saltando; La muchacha est comiendo; El nio est corriendo, etc.  The point is, you get a lot of work with the verb \"estar\" and a lot of work with the gerund (the \"ing\" form )of other verbs, but little else.

{"text": "I've taken a total of four semesters of Spanish divided up between High School and College, but after going three years without speaking Spanish, I needed to find a program to help me review before taking Fourth Semester Spanish at the senior college level.\n\nI was disappointed in the overall structure of the software. I thought I would learn more with each disk, and the phrases that are emphasized are more geared towards individuals who need to know Spanish on vacation or while studying abroad. The first two levels provide good vocabulary practice, but do not challenge the student to construct sentences. There are important Spanish basics, such as verb conjugation, that should be a major lesson in the first two levels. I felt like I was spending a bunch of time reviewing simple Spanish words, rather than learning to construct sentences. The creator of the software made some practice games to help the learning process, but for my level I've found the games are a bit too simple, even when I did not remember most of the vocabulary that was taught before the lessons. A lot of what I learned from the software is something that I can figure out by picking up a Spanish-English dictionary. I needed more practice dealing with verbs, sentence structure, expressing feelings, and more in-depth practice with telling time.\n\nI hate to be so critical of the software, because it can be interactive (the games) and there is some variety between the disks. It is also colorful- graphics, sound, etc. is pretty solid. However, for the price the software is originally marked at, I would invest in a e-book or even find some credible online tutorials if you are a student or someone hoping to learn Spanish for scholarly purposes. If you want to learn some basics, and practice in an interactive way to prepare for a vacation, a business trip or studying abroad, then this may be a good refresher in some important Spanish phrases you should know.\nIn conclusion, the usefulness of this software depends on what you are looking for. Are you a student who needs to eventually become fluent and construct your own phrases? Or are you simply looking to learn the basic, everyday phrases? Your answer to this question will determine if you will find use in this program.\nNote: I have not looked over the DVD; I am just rating the disks and programs I have gone through; this is why, despite initial dissapointment, I am grading the software three-stars rather than two.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I upgraded from Windows 2000 Professional because I have a stack of Win95/98 software worth over $200 (mostly for the kids) and had heard that XP was the actual realization of the promise to blend the 95/98/Me line with NT.\nI give XP 4 stars for coming through on this promise.  All but one CD I had that was labelled Win95, 98, or Me was installable / runnable on XP (and most of the stack would definitely not run on Win2K).  The one exception was a Jeopardy CD labelled Win95/98 which, for all I know, is a piece of junk anyway.\nWhat I don't like about the install process, though, and the reason I only give XP three stars overall, is that you never know ahead of time if you need to be Admin.  Try to install something as a non-Admin...XP seems to install it...it doesn't run quite right...reinstall as Admin...the software runs.  Bottom line:  always install as Admin.  But Microsoft's XP documentation says \"most software\" can be installed as non-Admin.  Which software are they talking about?  There was zero feedback during an install of Win95/98/Me stuff to give non-Admins any kind of warm fuzzy.\nOther details:\n1.  Upgrade process was fairly clean...I backed up all my data but didn't need to.  XP blew away some drivers for my CD-RW so I'll have to do some research there (at least XP warned me it would blow them away).  The whole process took less than an hour.\n2.  I'm running from a dual boot Red Hat Linux 7.0 (using LILO); there were no conflicts there (using FAT32).\n3.  I had heard people say how much faster XP is to boot and switch users.  Simply not so.  I'd say XP is comparable to Win2K, if not a little slower.\n4.  I was able to hook up a digital camera fairly easily, but XP does some weird things when I switch USB cables around (not unlike Win2K).  Whenever I connect the camera by removing the USB cable for the scanner (without touching the printer's USB cable), XP \"discovers\" my printer and tries to reinstall drivers for it.  Go figure.  Yet the printer still works fine if I ignore the message, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  Plug and play it never was, and still isn't.  (I think the digital camera software is supposed to start automatically on connection of USB cable to camera...this succeeds on occasion, but mostly I have to launch camera software myself.)\n5.  There's alot of talk about how the UI's been totally redesigned.  Not so.  It's been dressed up with alot of stuff.  The colors have been changed so that people who have never used windows (are there any?) will have an easier time learning it.\nIf they had wanted to solve a real problem...how about this one:  I can have my own custom settings for nearly everything now, in detail so annoyingly painful that I'd never be able to set up two XP boxes the same way.  But all I really want to do is have the blasted system remember that my login ID is associated to a 1600x1200 pixel screen in true color, and my kids get VGA.  But NO!  Just like in previous revs of Windows, Display settings are global, global, global.  Doesn't anyone at Microsoft get upset with this?  Doesn't it annoy anyone else to have the order of their desktop icons trashed every time some other user switches to low res?\n6.  On a happier note...when you fork over your $200 for an upgrade...there's a $25 rebate inside the box if you upgrade from Windows 2000 Professional.  Just purchase your XP upgrade before Feb 28, 2002 (mail in before March 31).", "label": 2}

{"text": "Hey everyone. Been using linux for a while. I can say that this is a very nice distro. But...\nTo all the Windows users considering the switch, I have some advice. Windows users are provided the comfort of reliable hardware support and everything \"just working\". This is so because almost all of the hardware vendors are providing full support for it. Many vendors have not jumped on the linux bandwagon and those that are doing so, are being very slow about it (prime example: ATI).\nI have experimented with many distros and found SuSE 9.0 Pro to be one of the best ever, IMHO. It was fairly newbie friendly, good hardware detection, a little flexible, and pretty to boot. So I decided to give 9.1 a try...\n...Well, I am typing this on my Windows box. I am having a bit of trouble installing 9.1 on my dual opteron box with my highpoint rocketraid 404 controller and 4 x 120GB Western Digital HDs. I have spent the last day and a half trying to get it installed the way I want it, with no success. I have identified what appears to be a bug with the HPT374 chipset as it cannot seem to read the early blocks of the hard drive on the first channel of the rocketraid controller. Consequently, that section of the hard drive cannot be assigned a mount point. I have not figured out exactly how much of the hard drive is unusable in this predicament.\nMoments like this are not at all uncommon among the gazillion linux distros out there, including the other \"commercial\" distros. No matter how \"user friendly\" a distro may claim to be, you will most certainly have to use a bit of nerd elbow grease to get things going in some fashion or another.\nI did install it to one of my hard drives just to lay my eyes on it. And let me say that it is FAST! Sexy looking too. Although, my Sound Blaster Audigy strangely was not configured correctly. I checked ALSA, and it was installed, but still no sound device. Strange. Will investigate more.\nAnd, of course, no 3d acceleration yet, because I have an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro and many problems have arisen surrounding SuSE 9.1 and ATI's drivers and UT2004 (which is all I care to play). I will have to wait until ATI finally produces some quality drivers (if ever), but I will keep the faith as I will never switch to nvidia. ATI just rules.\nFor the windows power users (which I still am one of), I have come to find that linux may not be your bag. Hardware IDE RAID is almost nonexistent in the 2.6.x kernel (if not completely unsupported), so software raid is usually your only option, which is completely unacceptable for most windows power users. I enjoyed my two hardware RAID arrays with windows XP, as I had some seriously fast transfer rates and low cpu utilization, I have yet to see performance like that with linux' softare RAID solution.\nAlso, ATI owners are going to have a tough time with linux, as per my driver comments above, just to get 3d acceleration going and playing your favorite UT or Counterstrike or Splinter Cell. You have to be a friggin' pseudo programmer to get the drivers working... and then you gotta cross your fingers in hopes that your game will even run with the winex or crossover office emulator included in many commercial distros. And like I have experienced, if it does run, spotty performance. I have had to hit the forums countless times to get my card going, and once that does get going, geting my games to run.\nNow, most of this is not linux' fault. It is mostly the vendors at which to point the blame. But this does not matter to most of you windows users who are curious about linux and want to try it. Not when you've got several hard drives, a RAID controller to use them with, a $400 video card, a massive third party cooler for that video card to overclock it with, dual processors, and really fast CAS2 RAM. You don't want to hear that. You just want something to just work. You just want to fire up UT2004 knowing that it will run, you just want to render something in Photoshop with all the speed and glory that dual processors and two hardware RAID arrays can provide, and you know what, I don't blame you.\nSo, windows converts be prepared, as linux is no smooth ride in my book. I am still dedicated to learning more and using it. But I will always have my windows box to do all the gaming and more productive tasks, for now.\nI guess the point I am trying to get across to the fellow windows users is: make sure you research SuSE 9.1's and linux's compatibility with your current hardware. This will require reading all the reviews available on it and a serious stretch on the forums pertaining to it. It will probably save you a lot of time and headache, and if bad enough, money.\nSo, to all those who are considering the switch, please take my words to heart. If you choose to make the move, just know what you are getting into. Good luck.", "label": 2}
{"text": "*** This is a partial retraction to the original 5-star review I gave this.  I've since abandoned this product for McAfee's Firewall (as bundled with VirusScan 7).\nThe best mix of features, customization, and power has always been AtGuard, but that product has been licensed to Symantec and released as the inferior Norton Internet Security software.  I can say that Zone Labs has gotten some of it right, but the Broderbund edition is not updateable and the controls are flawed.  Worse?  It is susceptible to buffer overflows.\nOut of the box, its wizard-like setup routine makes it easy for anyone to lock down their machine without screwing up their Internet access.  The associated help is relevant and informative, and I would have no problem letting my mother set up Zone Alarm herself (of course, she'll still ask me if she should click on \"Next\", but that's fine with me).\nHowever, after using the product, I can now state with wistful certainty that the granularity, while there, is somewhat lacking.  The Privacy Advisor is constantly annoying users, and there's no easy way to limit what kinds of \"things\" it monitors.\nWorse, blocking hostnames and IPs isn't very easy, and it should be.\nWorst?  20-February-2004 saw the news releases of buffer overflow vulnerabilities with ZAP4 and ZAP4.5.  The good news is that Zone Labs is making updates available.  The bad news is that if you're a Broderbund-originated user, you've already encountered problems with your license not allowing you to update the software.\nIn the end, I got tired of emailing the absolutely stupid Broderbund support people for help, and Zone Labs surprised me by not helping one bit (they actually turned me back to Broderbund without so much as an apology for the denial of help).\nI went back to McAfee's Firewall, did a little configuring, and I think it'll work for me long-term.  I've despaired of ever seeing AtGuard resurrect in my lifetime, and there's no way Norton-Symantec will ever rewrite their NIS product to match its old standard of excellence.

What I learned was that just because you're a whiz at 1 kind of software made by 1 company doesn't mean anything when you go to software made by another company. I could not get past just turning it on. Everything was so different. I got worried and figured that I needed help to learn this. I didn't want to spend some more money but if I didn't the software that I had already bought was going to be worthless to me.\n\nI sure am glad that I chose to get this. In the first 30 seconds of the DVD I learned an easier way to add media (video, audio, pictures) than what I had learned in studying Adobe's website for an hour. After watching it all, it seems so simple now. The narrator does move very quickly through the functions and how to work them so the pause button on my DVD player got a real workout.

{"text": "Since buying PartitionMagic 8.0, I've changed how my computer's XP drive is partitioned from a single partition to seven partitions.  I've created, destroyed, moved, resized, copied and hidden various partitions at one time or another.  On that SATA drive, I've only had one problem with PM:  when I copied a partition, for some reason it moved all my other partitions around unexpectedly.  I don't know why it did that, but it was probably my fault.  If I had paid closer attention to the tasks PM was telling me it was going to do, I would have noticed the odd behavior and cancelled the action.  That \"paying attention\" thing is extremely important when using this software.  I've never done any permanent harm with it, but I've done several things accidently that I could have avoided if I had just put more thought into what I was telling PM to do.  If you do use this program, I highly recommend you research every action you intend to do and double-check exactly what PM thinks you want it to do.  It's very easy to make a serious mistake with this software.  Make backups before you do anything.\n\nOn my primary hard drive, I really have no complaint with PM.  However, I'm not quite satisfied with it on my external USB drive.  The interesting thing is that according to the documentation file, Partition Magic isn't even supposed to work on USB drives if it can't do all activities entirely within Windows (i.e., if it has to reboot to finish the job, it's not supposed to work).  Yet, before I researched that topic, I had copied my active XP partition to the USB drive (which had to be done in \"DOS\" mode).  The one real problem I've had with PM is when I tried to resize the single partition on that USB drive while in XP:  half-way through the resizing, it gave me an \"Error #11117\" message and just restored everything to the way it was.  I ended up moving my data off the drive, repartitioning it using XP's Disk Management console, and putting the data back.  I couldn't find any information anywhere to explain that error message.  Since then, I've used PM to add, delete, copy, and hide partitions on that drive without problem.  So, I'm not certain what the problem was.\n\nIf you know what you're doing with your partitions and can bear the risk of really messing yourself up, I give this program a decent rating of 3 stars out of 5.  But, if you don't know what you're doing and have a tendency to just try anything without researching it, you might want to hold off on this program (or any like it) unless you're truly desperate.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought Windows XP and I am happy with its interface and its stability.  I don't have the fear of crashing that I sometimes had with 95, 98, or ME.  However, I am VERY sorry that I bought this product now.  It just is not ready for prime time yet because to little is compatible with it.\nAs proof of compatibility problems, check out Microsoft's own web site of appproved hardware.  A great example is in Wireless networking cards.  Virtually no cards are approved, and I kknow that my card went from working flawlessly to not being recognized by my system as soon as XP was installed.\nThese same problems exist with software as well.  XP is not as backwards compatible as the ads would have you believe.  Additionally, even software that is supposed to be 100% compatible has some minor bugs that flareup from time to time.\nI do think that XP is a worthy purchase, but not until the next version when A) they have had the chance to work out more bugs, and B) Other companies have had more time to develop new drivers.\nAs a final note, I would HIGHLY advise that you do a full install and not just an upgrade install.  I did an upgrade install, and it just hasn't worked well.  Most of my key programs either have to be reinstalled anyways, or they don't work, so why would you want to have them sitting on your system.

{"text": "I first played this game a few years ago when I was a fifth grader myself, and I recently revisited it. When I was 10, I had mixed feelings about this game, and I still do.\n\nKID APPEAL:\nThe game is rather engaging - its adventure-filled storyline, while slightly weird, appeals a lot to the age range, and the tomboyish protagonist, Jo Hammet, appeals to both males and females. The subtitle that is occasionally attributed to it - \"Jo Hammet, Kid Detective\" - is slightly deceptive; the player doesn't do too much actual sleuthing. \"Jo Hammet, Kid Bomb Squad\" might be more accurate, but your kid won't mind - it's fun either way. Also, some of the activities in this game are very fun and arcade-like. The activities that are not action-packed tend to be more puzzle-oriented, but rather than being frustrating, they are usually pleasurable and fun - not too challenging, not too easy.\n\nA glaring exception to this is the Crossword Puzzle game. It asks some good geography questions, but it also asks questions about art history that are VERY obscure and that no fifth grader should be expected to know. The player can look through an entire museum to find the answers, but unfortunately, it's still quite hard - especially since there's SO much to look through. (One of the artists that you had to answer a question about only painted ONE tiny painting in the entire museum, and it was hidden in an obscure corner!) The crossword puzzle could've been interesting, educational and fun for kids, but sadly, it didn't exactly \"come together\". I agree with the reviewer who suggest Google!\n\nGENERAL EASE OF USE:\nThis product is relatively easy to use and straightforward, but not as much as other kids' educational games (i.e., it doesn't walk you through every step like other games), but this isn't necessarily all bad. There are a few points that are challenging, however. For example, over and over again in this game, you have to go through a \"dialog\" portion where you select things for Jo to say to various characters. Unfortunately, it's really unintuitive; in order to move on from the dialog portion and progress in the game, you need to say a certain \"trigger\" phrase. The option that's the \"trigger\" seems pretty random, at least in the first couple dialog sessions, but as you move on, it starts making at least a little bit more sense.\n\nAlso, one game (which basically consists of solving math problems) is just a tad confusing at first, due to the fact that, rather than typing in the final answer, you have to do it step-by-step - for example, if you're answering 48 + 18, you'd first up the numerals in the ones column, and thus type in 6, and then the program automatically enters the 1 by itself and carries it to the tens column. At first, it's confusing, but once you get used to it, it's actually rather nice and makes it easier. Unfortunately, if you happen to learn how to solve math problems with a different method, it kinda gets difficult and you might need a little help. (This happened with me for multiplication.)\n\nOverall, though, the game is pretty easy to use - there are just a few issues here and there that can be bothersome.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE:\nFirst, I'd like to say that the math in this game is really solid and age-appropriate. You have one game (described in the previous section) that's basically just answering math problems - a little tedious for some kids, but definitely very educational, and personally, I found it enjoyable and challenging. Another game has you using fractional measurements to mix up juice drinks, which is fun, challenging and definitely educational. The last game that involves math has you guiding a tiny android around the inside of a bomb, turning on and off different swtiches that each represent a decimal amount in order to end up at a certain number. All of the math in this game is age appropriate, solid, challenging but not too hard - just overall great, and incorporated well into the games too.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from the math, I find the educational content in this game pretty weak. They try to incorporate a lot of subjects - art, geography, history, parts of speech - but the implementation is kind of messed up. For example, in the section that's supposed to teach history, you have to go through arcade-like levels to find certain objects. Unfortunately, while a window that describes each object pops up when you select it, you don't have to read it or anything - you just need to find the objects, press a checkmark, and you're good to go. No real learning is required.\n\nThere are a lot of not-explicitly-educational, puzzle-type games. They won't please parents who want their kids to learn actual school subjects, but I think they're pretty good for building some general thinking skills, which is definitely a good thing. Still, maybe it'd be better if they put in some...I don't know...READING or WRITING perhaps? All they have in the language arts arena is a weak parts-of-speech game that doesn't really teach much at all; all you have to do is figure out what words would best go in the context, and it's really obvious what words belong.\n\nAlso, if you want your kid to pay attention to one particular subject, you don't really have an option to do that, from what I can see - you have to play specific games as you progress through the game; you can't really select a particular subject. Maybe I'm wrong and there is a way, but I haven't found it.\n\nOTHER:\nI'd also like to mention that this game is very repetitive. There are only about 8 games, and you have to play most of them 6 times each. It's not exactly bursting with variety, but your kid might be willing to persevere to make it through the storyline.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'd say this game is pretty fun, and your kid will probably enjoy it. How much they will enjoy it depends. If your kid is the type to persevere through a good story despite a few long or challenging points, and they like this type of plotline, they'll probably find it really fun. If they get frustrated easily, however, they'll probably give up pretty fast.\n\nAs for the educational value, the math is really strong and fun, but the other subjects kind of failed due to implementation, and the language arts is especially weak. So if you want a game to help your kid practice math and general puzzle-solving (and using Google!), this will probably be a good game education-wise. But if you want to improve reading or writing, this will be pretty useless for them.\n\nLike I said, my feelings are thoroughly mixed. If you can find it for cheap and your kid likes these kinds of games, you should probably go for it. But if you're looking for an exceptional product, sorry - this isn't it.

{"text": "As a Norton Antivirus user for the last 4 years, I decided to upgrade to the 2005 version.  The upgrade went smoothly and the product is reportedly quite effective at detecting and eliminating viruses, however, be warned -- Norton bogs the system down quite horribly.

This seems like a pretty viable way, with a good price, to get a handle on Adobe Flash CS5.\n\nI read the intro, plugged it in and thought I was going to just take off with it. The vocal on the presentation are pleasing and easy to understand. If you miss something it is *so easy* to back up and hear it again. There is closed caption at the bottom, but if you need that, good luck...it is pretty tiny. It took me a while to set things up so that I could use the assets that come along with the classes (or even find them) in order to do a 'hands-on' follow along with the lessons. Was pretty frustrating to set up an environment to do that as you can't save back to the DVD and Flash liked to argue with me about the destination of the items I wanted to save.\n\nEnded up just copying the DVD onto my computer and then using the files from there (but starting from the DVD itself) worked fine. Another thing I noticed is that when it opens up the tutorial screen is huge and not scalable. This to me is a royal pain because I wanted to work AND watch the video. There is a *work and watch* mode you can put it into, however then the *watch* portion becomes very small and you cannot minimize it without going back into regular mode (which is not full screen mode, but takes the whole screen without being able to 'down size it' like other items I am used to.\n\nThose frustrations aside, it is a sharp presentation that includes tests and items to help you make sure you capture the essence of what is being taught.

Well, they don't happen with newer versions of Windows  (because applications are forced to run in their own protected memory  space, and can't corrupt the other applications, because the OS (Operating  System) prevents them from destroying each other.)

Most items will install rapidly, however, we have seen some software that will appear not to be loading but after several minutes (as long 10 to 15 minutes in some cases) it will install.\n\nBe sure the cd is clean.  As all the product we sell is new, this is usually not a problem, however, sometimes fine dust will settle on a cd and impede the install process.  By simply blowing on it will remove it the dust.\n\nUnfortunately we can NOT replace or refund the following:\n\nItems that were shipped 30 days previous to today's date.\n\nItems we did not originally sell you.  (Some buyers have attempted to return software not purchased from us - unfortunately, we will know if that is the case and no refund or exchange will be issued).\n\nIf you believe you have defective software, you may return it with a Letter Of Explanation as to the problem encountered, including your email address and original order number and of course your name and address..\n\nUpon receipt we will test it.\n\nIf it loads and plays, there will be no refund or exchange of product.  However, should you want the item returned, we will mail it back to you upon payment of our normal shipping rates.\n\nIf it will not load or play and has not been tampered with, we will replace or refund the item and pay the shipping, plus refund the shipping required to send the defective item back to us, up to the rates below:\n\nAll jewel case items must be returned by 1st class mail.\n\nAll retail box items must be returned by 1st class mail if possible.\n\nYou will need to send ALL THE FOLLOWING:\n\nItem purchased with all the original packaging.\n\nA  letter explaining the problem encountered\n\nYour email address\n\nYour original order number\n\nThe name and address you wish a replacement to be sent.\n\nSend the item to:\n\nBart Hartman\n\nI Global Cds\n\n1126 Terrace Crest\n\nEl Cajon CA 92019\n\nUSA", "label": 2}
{"text": "As many reviews have stated, Windows XP is a significant step forward in features and ease of use.  BUT, there are real problems becasue not all the hardware drivers needed to effectively install Windows XP are available yet.  Specifically, drivers are not yet available for my  15 month old HP 8250i CD-RW and my brand new Creative Modem Blaster V.92.  The general IDE CD driver that Microsoft provides allows me to read standard software and audio CD's; but without the correct HP specific driver for my CD drive, I cannot read my data back-up CD's nor use the CD drive to burn new CD's.  The Microsoft generic V.90 modem driver seems to work OK, but I suspect that once a specific driver for my modem is released; hopefully, I will get a little better performance.\nOne other problem I discovered is that my Norton 2001 Anti-Virus and Utilities is not compatable with Windows XP--forcing me to buy Norton 2002 Anti-Virus and Utilities.  So the (money) that I planned to spend to upgrade to Windows XP grew to (much more).\nIn spite of these problems, I like Windows XP.  My recommedation is to upgrade to XP, but wait 90 days or so until\nXP compatible drivers become available.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm a big fan of the \"Once Around\" slot.  The version on here is not like the original.  First, there is no music.  If you spin the bonus round, there is no \"Mo-nop-o-ly\" jingle either.  Overall, all of the sound effects are lackluster and rather dull compared to the real thing.  The bonus round is really boring without music.  Second, you are forced to play 9 lines every time (the casino version lets you play 1,3,5 or 7 as well).  Next, there is no \"Last Bet\" button, for quick play.  You have to resubmit a bet and press the spin button.  Next, the graphics are not the same as the slot.  They are adequate, but they look a little odd if you're used to the real thing.  Finally, the game is slooooooow.  I have a 1.2 GHz machine and this software doesn't make use of it.  It takes a long time for the 5 wheels to spin compared to the real thing, further detracting from the feeling you are playing the real thing.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm sitting here thirty-six hours away from sharing my script with my screenwriting group and I don't know if I'll have a script to show them.  This program started out fine at first.  I, too, didn't mind having to put the CD in each time; afterall, I have to put my disk in each time I work.\nFirst time I noticed a problem was when I tried to email my script to a friend for comments - you can't.  Unless the other person has Hollywood Screenwriter, they won't be able to open it.  The program doesn't even allow you to cut your text into a Word document (or any other application for that matter.)  Secondly, the top and bottom margins were set at 1.5 inches so for several weeks I thought my script was much longer than it actually was.  The margins are easily corrected, but still, 1 inch is proper industry format - they should know that.  Third, the spacing between scene headings is incorrect.  Proper industry format says three spaces, this program gives you two.  I had to go in and hit a hard return at the beginning of every scene heading in a hundred page script - very annoying.  Fourth, you can not incorporate a (beat) into the dialogue.  As soon as you type a parantheses, the program thinks its acting instructions and formats whatever is in the () accordingly.  On the online FAQ they recognize this problem and say to use [] or {} for beats!!!  That's great, try to break into the business by having your script look different than other professional scripts.  I don't think so.  I makes me wonder what other formatting stlyle is incorrect.\nFinally, and this is a doozy, at any point you can go and try to open a script you've been working on forever and find that it isn't there.  The program gives an Error 32, whatever that means, and opens up what it calls your script but is actually one blank page.  The company's online help has an update you can download to fix this problem and after the download, you'll supposedly be able to recover your script.  Didn't work for me.  I opened an older version I had and then re-did my work to the best of my memory.  Now, this morning, I popped the CD in and...nothing.  The program won't open at all.\nWhen I researched the different programs to buy I did see mention of some little quirks but I figured for the price it would be a good place to start.  Wrong.  Unless you have no intention of sharing your script with anyone via email, etc. or don't care about proper format, or don't mind just randomly losing your whole damn script for no apparent reason, spend the extra few buck for something that works.  Speaking of which - does anyone have any recommendations?  I'm now in the market.", "label": 0}

In fact, I would say that TaxCut makes e-filing a breeze except for one thing.\n\nEarly on, you're prompted to download updates, which the software states should take a few minutes.  I suppose \"a few\" is subjective.  I actually thought the update was stuck, but it turns out the size of the file is 13.9 MB.  If you have dialup, you may as well download that while you sleep, the night before you plan to sit down to the actual task.\n\nBut that's not all: once the update has downloaded, there are some key components not yet up and running, if you itemize, primarily having to do with charitable contributions.  The update says that these will roll out on January 27... And that's simply not true, as I downloaded the update on January 29.  If you go to the H&R Block site and poke around, you find that the missing forms will be available \"mid-February.\"  Well, which is it?\n\nIf I had wanted to wait until mid-February to file, I wouldn't be buying TaxCut in the first place.

{"text": "AGH!\nRoxio Go Back came with my copy of Norton SystemWorks disk, and the first thing I noticed after installing it was, booting up my PC (1.8 GHz Pentium 4, 512K DDR SDRAM, WinXP) suddenly took up to 3 times longer than before...other software suddenly took 2-3 times longer to boot up.  Even my [moderately priced] high-speed cable internet connection slowed down, to how my old dial-up connection was on a good day.  I began having problems shutting down, had to resort to just hitting the power off button sometimes.  Then I began having problems starting up...once in a while my PC would lockme into in 8-bit display mode, so I had to restart in order to go back to my normal graphics display mode.\nFinally, about 3 months later, my PC would start up ONLY in the 8 bit display mode.  I lived with this for a few days hoping it would eventually go away, but finally decided to actually USE \"Go Back\" for a change.  So I \"went back\" about 2 months to an alleged \"safe point.\"  Bad, bad idea---it stopped booting up at all and started giving me the XP \"Blue Screen of Death.\"  To its credit, I WAS able to get out of this hairy situation by \"going back\" to a \"safe point\" only 3 days back, finding myself right back in 8-bit graphics mode.  But then again, I would never have NEEDED to \"go back\" if I hadn't installed this blight disguised as a software utility.\nAt which point I did a little Internet research, looking at the CNET users' comments on this product I realized that I wasn't the only victim by far.  So I removed GoBack, and whaddaya know...PRESTO!  All aforementioned problems evaporated and have never come back since.  My system now boots up well under 15 seconds instead of 2 minutes, and everything just zings along beautifully.\nMoral: somethings are just too good to be true.  If you already have Roxio Go Back on your computer, remove it before it starts to screw your PC like it did mine.  If you don't have GoBack, spend your money on a CD burner instead and just get in the habit of backing up your docs regularly, or if you want to be extra careful, use Norton Ghost to back up your whole system every couple of weeks.", "label": 0}

Worse still is the search. The designers apparently felt that having a stack of magazines in front of you is the ideal interface because this search stinks.

{"text": "This is one of the best tools for complete beginners to Japanese. Human Japanese will teach you how to write the kana, why the Japanese writing system is the way it is, as well as basic grammar and about 1800 words/sentences (with good quality audio recorded by native speakers). Everything is explained clearly in plain English and I found it fun to use. I only have a few minor complaints:\n\n-Human Japanese does not mention pitch/word accent. While Japanese does not have a \"stressed\" accent like English does, syllables can be low or high in pitch (similar to how our voice rises when we ask a question in English). However, the pitch accent is very obvious in the recordings, so as long as you model your pronunciation after the audio, you'll know how to say the words properly.\n-This software briefly mentions whispered vowels, but only for \"su\" and not other vowels. When vowels come between certain consonants, they are often whispered. Again, if you copy the audio's pronunciation you'll be fine.\n-The search functionality included in the software is helpful, but it only searches for key words, not the entire text. It would be nice if it showed all instances of a word.\n-Another complaint is that words and sentences must mainly be learned through memorization. They are presented in a list format that is clickable with audio. There are short quizzes and games available to practice, but it would be cool if they made this part of the learning more interactive and fun, especially since this is software. The advantage of the list format is that it gets right to the point, so if you just want to learn words quickly without going through a bunch of animations, you can. It's more like an interactive textbook with good explanations.\n-Additionally, since Human Japanese is a beginner course, it only gives an introduction to kanji and doesn't cover all the grammar found in a regular textbook. Its purpose is to give you the confidence that you can study Japanese, even by yourself! For what it teaches, the price is right.\n\nIt's easy to be overwhelmed by Japanese as a beginner because it is completely backwards from English. Textbooks often assume that you already know how to write the kana and they don't explain the basics in much detail. It's a shame that most textbooks aren't suited for self-learning beginners, but that's where Human Japanese excels. After finishing this course, you'll have a very solid foundation and be able to jump into any popular Japanese textbook series.\n\nIf any of my friends ask me what they should use to start learning Japanese, I'm definitely going to recommend this. It's suitable and friendly for just about anyone with an electronic device. I don't think I can say that about the majority of language materials I own. I really hope this company makes more advanced levels, as well as versions for other languages. I'm also trying to learn some Chinese right now and a Human Chinese would be wonderful!\n\nInstead of reading reviews, just go to the Human Japanese website and try it out for yourself. There is a demo available for your browser as well as a downloadable version for Windows. It goes through 8-12 chapters depending on the demo, and there are 40 chapters total, so you should be able to get a good feel for the full version. Human Japanese is also available for the Mac on the Mac App Store, as well as the iPhone, Android, and Windows 7 phones. For the phones there is also a free \"Lite\" version, which I downloaded prior to writing this review. The phone versions seem to be the same as the PC/Mac ones. I haven't used the phone app much, but it lists the same 40 lessons and the first few chapters have the same exact text and audio. It's obviously a bit easier to read the text on my computer screen than on my phone, but the formatting looks fine.\n\nIf you want to learn through software and you've thought about trying Rosetta Stone, get this instead. It's much better \"bang for your buck\" than Rosetta Stone and you'll have a more thorough understanding of how the Japanese language works. It doesn't cover as much vocabulary as Rosetta Stone or use pictures, but there are so many other cheaper (and more efficient) methods to build vocabulary, such as Anki, a free flashcard software, with user-shared flashcard decks (some even include pictures and audio).\n\nOverall, 9/10.\n\nIf you are looking for an audio program, too, I really like Michel Thomas' Beginners Japanese course. Similar to Human Japanese, it will give you a nice start to speaking and basic grammar. I think it would complement this software well.\n\nA little about my Japanese studies: I'm using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Japanese-for-Everyone-A-Functional-Approach-to-Daily-Communication/dp/4889962344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication</a>&nbsp;as my main textbook. For Kanji I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Remembering-the-Kanji-Vol-1-A-Complete-Course-on-How-Not-to-Forget-the-Meaning-and-Writing-of-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824831659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Remembering the Kanji, Vol. 1: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters</a>. To review vocab/grammar/kanji I use Anki, a free flashcard software with spaced-repetition.\n\nIf you want some more ideas for well-reviewed resources, I've made a Listmania List called The \"Best\" Books/Resources for Learning Japanese: Beginner to Advanced. I also created a guide with a bunch of free resources titled: So you'd like to...Learn Japanese Inexpensively (Free Resources Included). I'll post the links for those in the comments in case you are interested.\n\nGood luck with your Japanese Studies!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I bought PC-cillin 2003 to replace a McAfee product which was worse than useless (it took *forever* to initialise each time my Windows 2000 system was rebooted and locked up many processes while you were waiting for it to decide - after many minutes - to continue.) PC-cillin 2003 doesn't have that problem, at least. It appears to be quite a competent product and has a few features which may or may not be useful to you (my mid-level rating is partly because I will not need some of the included features.) Included among these are a personal firewall (I use the excellent free version of ZoneAlarm instead) and protection for WiFi setups (which I don't yet have) and PDAs (which I do).\nInstallation was touted as easy but in fact it caused confusion by taking *several minutes* to start the Windows Installer the first time I tried. After uninstalling and deleting the newly created directory (and two from previous trials of the product), it worked normally.\nThe program requires registration over the web before you can use the Intelligent Update feature - allowing you to download new virus-recognition (pattern) files and updates to the scanning engine. This registration process will also apparently *disable* multiple copies of PC-cillin: if, for example, you try and install it on two different machines using the same serial number. I can't confirm whether or not this is the case. Also, be advised that you should *disable* your existing firewall and browser pop-up killer *before* installing this product or it will fail to contact its remote server for program and pattern file updates and will also have trouble completing the registration process, as browser screens that it pops up will be suppressed. If you do make this mistake, the update screen of the program makes it look as if you still have a step to do to complete the registration when in fact it is already done. Confusing, and a sign of careless programming.\nThe auto-update feature also appears to have some bugs. On my system it successfully updated the pattern file but did not automatically update the engine to the latest version. Following the instructions on the Trend Micro website that supposedly tells you how to manually update the engine did not work either. Their technical support has not yet responded to my queries about this...\nOverall this program is probably OK - I don't know how competently it detects and handles viruses as I haven't had one recently. It is way too expensive at its normal retail price, but the current rebate running (as of January 2003) puts it under ten bucks and therefore it becomes reasonable. However it has some confusing behaviour in some areas and ties you in to future expense with the yearly requirement to fork over more cash to keep the ability to download new pattern files and updates. If you are aware of the above issues and requirements, I can recommend it - but if what I describe above seems like too much hassle, steer clear.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Alright--this might turn out to be a lengthy review! So if you wanna skip to the grits, I'll let you know exactly where to go.\n\nFirst, I'll start you off with a little history lesson so that you know where I'm coming from in relation to language. I'm one of those people, one of those thousands of people who simply didn't get language. A second language wouldn't STICK in my brain. As soon as I began to grasp a concept, it would slip. As many Americans do, I was forced (more or less) to take a second language to pass high school. I chose spanish, as it is a money making language in the US. All throughout my spanish career, I struggled. In no offense, I didn't like the language. I didn't care about the culture, I didn't care about anything at all in relation to Spanish except for passing the class. Well, needless to say, while I passed the class, I didn't learn a damn thing. I didn't know why, and assumed it was because I was just one of those thousands of people who just didn't get language. But I do understand language now. It's taken me to my third year of college and a linguistics class to understand WHY I never really learned spanish--and the answer is so simple I could slap myself. It was because I didn't CARE about it! True, you can \"learn\" something that you don't care about--but do you excel? How long does it stick in your brain? Do you remember it or do you actually LEARN it? Ask yourself this!! I realized that I don't give a rats hat about spanish, and that subconsciously affected my learning. But I desperately wanted to become bilingual, so I took a look at a culture and language that I DO care about...\n\n**(This is what you want to read!)\nThe Human Japanese program is outstanding, amazing, enthralling, captivating, and any other positive \"-ing\" word you can think of. YES, MAC USERS, WE CAN GET IT. Just not here, search it in the Ap store, and you will find it for around 20 bucks (18.99 if my memory hasn't failed yet). Just as the other comments say, it is indeed HUMAN like. He is so warm, simple, and even kind of funny! He cracks a few jokes here and there, and relates tough or questionable subjects to things English speakers can understand. He even gives history lessons so that we can better understand the \"whys\" and the \"hows.\" There are animations, a real Japanese woman helping with pronunciation, everything! I absolutely love the program. I admit, I've just start using it--but at the same time, I'm halfway through learning Higarana. And, these things STICK. I don't know how he does it, but he puts his information in a way that really does stay with you. I remember things from pages (the program reads like a warm, friendly book) ages ago. In spanish class, I couldn't remember things we've talked about SENTENCES ago. Best 20 bucks spent.\n\nNow, if you WANT to learn another language, you LIKE Japan and are INTERESTED in the language, with no experience, Human Japanese is the program for you. You have to want to learn it, but when you do, Human Japanese is here to hold your hand. Buy it! I pray that he makes an intermediate and advanced levels, because I don't want to learn from anyone or anything else. :)\n\nLong response! Eh??", "label": 1}

{"text": "I live in Idaho, and actually, really, go into the wilderness.  The level of detail provided by garmin's u.s. topo offering is honestly not sufficient for accurately setting waypoints.  National Geographic's state series is indeed sufficient (in fact it's the best for Idaho).  Not to be cruel, but being able to download inadequately detailed map source is not nearly as important as being able to download truly accurate waypoints.  Buying both packages would obviously be the best solution, but really you can set up all the detail you need (for getting in & out) using just national geographic (whereas you can't with garmin's u.s. topo stuff).\nCritical note: I strongly recommend not carrying *just* electronic maps if you really, truly, go into wilderness.  Electronic toys aren't foolproof - they break through no fault of your own, they get dropped, can get destroyed if you fall, etc.  Paper maps should *also* be carried - ideally ones printed out just for your current trip.\nThe garmin hardware itself is truly impressive.

{"text": "Norton is dead as most you know. It will work on 10.2 or earlier but Norton SystemWorks does not work on any Mac OS after 10.2 very well. Norton had one thing going for it - it did a nice job of repairing B-tree catalog errors and directories - when things started going wonky, if you ran Norton, it would clear things up for a while. The other features might've worked well 5 years earlier but in the end (even though they updated them to run under OSX) were of dubious value - defragmentation, file recovery etc ... especially in the end when you no longer boot from the Norton CD, it was all rather useless and in case you hadn't noticed, the Norton UNINSTALLER only runs under OS9 so if your Mac can't boot OS9 (Classic), you can't remove all those invisible files they leave scattered around.\n\nDRIVE GENIUS looks like the best replacement for Norton. I had a drive go down - it wouldn't mount but since APPLE's DISK ULTITY could \"see\" the drive, the drive was fine, it was just a matter of restoring the directory. DRIVE GENIUS was the only Mac utility that could recover the directory. My only complaint would be that under REPAIR, there are submenu choices - for some odd reason REPAIR did not repair it but REBUILD did. It would seem that users like us do not really care if you rebuild or repair - as long as you can get the directory fixed so it shows up as an HDD, all is good in the world, right?\n\nIn addition, you get other features such as DEFRAGMENT, DUPLICATE, SECTOR EDIT, SHRED, INTEGRITY CHECK, BENCHTEST & SCAN. Of course, Defrag, Duplicate and Shred are pretty obvious as to what they do. Sector Edit is for advanced users - you get to look at the underlying raw hex (?) of the data on the drive so if you feel comfortable doing that. Integrity Check & Scan seems to do the same thing in checking the underlying hardware of your HDD.\n\nDRIVE GENIUS has a pretty nice user interface and you get a constant feedback on when it's doing repairs/rebuilding. That is an EXCELLENT feature. When you are wondering if your data is still intact, you want to know what the utility is doing. And you can boot off the CD - presumably not Intel Macs as it's 10.4\n\nIt is not perfect though. For drives that Apple recognizes as drives (you get the query if you want to initialize/eject or ignore) - I was able to get the directory fixed on an IDE USB drive but not an IDE Firewire drive so if you are in the same situation, you might need to plug it in as a USB drive versus in a firewire enclosure. But since it was actually able to see and repair the USB drive, I consider that a victory of sorts plus the the interface is much more re-assuring than the interface of TechTools Pro or DiskWarrior.\n\nTECHTOOLS PRO is now much nicer looking and now feature laden. If you have a couple Macs and quite a few HDD's as I do, you'll most likely want to get it to have it handy to do some things that DRIVE GENIUS does not do. One advanatge is that it can actually test the hardware of your Mac including memory, cache, etc ... unfortunately, it still has the same old \"feature\" of the old TechTools in that it launches into the test mode as soon as you click on SUITES (what they call hardware tests if choose to do them altogether). For the unintiated, this can scare the crap out of you as when it gets to the video test, your screen changes color in rapid succession (at least it's faster than before) but it's still scary and disconcerting because they do NOT tell you it's about to happen! The other main choices are TESTS, PERFORMANCE, TOOLS & SAFETY. Tests is actually the hardware test that does not scare you. You actually have to press the start button before it races off to check your mac itself. PERFORMANCE lets you optomize the drive or fix directories. TOOLS is actually a nice addition - it is broken down into multiple parts: eDRIVE which lets you create a bootable partition. Aparently you can create this partition even if you haven't physically partitioned your main HDD - frankly, I'm a little too leery of messing with this feature to try it on my main HDD but good luck if you're brave enough. You can also create a duplicate on another HDD.  In addition under TOOLS, you get DATA RECOVERY, WIPE DATA, AUDIO & VIDEO testing. The last choice is SAFETY which offers under it:  PROTECTION SETUP which is nice as you can back up your directory info; DIAGNOSTICS SETUP which creates an auto schedule for checking up on your Mac & HDD; SMART SETUP for auto notification when your drive is about to have problems and ALERT so it can email you.\n\nTo be honest, I had bad experiences in using TechTool's (before it went Pro) in using to fix directories. Like other people, it seemed to have ended trashing most of my files so I can't vouch for its ability to repair anything but the diagnostics and early warning setup are unique to the Mac in one package so if you are really dependent on your Mac to start up & run everyday, it's probably worth getting the diagnostics and eDrive feature - when you actually have a directory problem though, you are probably better off running DRIVE GENIUS first.\n\nOne other nice feature of TECHTOOLS PRO is you actually get a printed manual. DRIVE GENIUS is a PDF - unless you print it out, not real useful when you can't access your Mac.\n\nThe third main Mac utility in this genre is: DISKWARRIOR. It's main feature is that it has the SMART warning system also to let you know when you might experience a HDD failure. It has some rudimentary repair/rebuild feature but I ran into two main problems. It's hard to tell exactly what it's attempting to do. The progress bar doesn't move very much but the main problem is EXACTLY what you do NOT want out of a utility ... It tells you there is directory problem but it could not fix it. Not what you want when the HDD does not mount.

{"text": "UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows.  Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.\n\nNational Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.\n\nSince these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.\n\nThese maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.\n\n  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work. I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps.\n\n  The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions. For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen. You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button. The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is. Another observation is that there is no EDIT menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications. But these are relatively small concerns that you can quickly adapt to.  All in all this is a very valuable tool that I highly recommend.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Buy this instead of their bundle with their bluetooth GPS. Vuy the Holux GPSlim instead, it's the same receiver but in a more convenient package which doesn't need to be powered on every time and has a replaceable battery and external antenna connection.\n\nThis review is based on six months of daily use and a couple of 3500 mile trips through western USA and Canada.\n\nI use a Dell Axim X51v, so performance is not an issue, even on thousand mile routes the initial route calculation only takes a few seconds.\n\nInstallation. The installation was simple and trouble free. I had heard that getting the product might be an issue but as soon as I connected my PDA to the internet and entered the key I got authorized. I guess the individual state maps are on the rest of the CDs, I only needed the installation and the first two map CDs. For myself I'd rather this had been on a DVD. By comparison iGuidance Europe, which is on a DVD, took two trips to the Internet to search for help and quite a bit of messing with the Bluetooth connection before it could see the receiver.\n\nConnecting. If the application is started whilst Bluetooth is disabled on the PDA it simply enables it and connects. Other than waiting a few seconds there has never been an issue with the Bluetooth initerface. If you need to pair it the code is 0000. If you need to use a different GPS then tap the screen, hit \"change preferences\" then three right arrows and then \"show GPS status\". Hit the \"Configure\", use the arrows to select the right hardware and hit Select. Easy. In iGuidance I had to add the receiver as an 'outgoing' serial connection and then tell it which com port had been assigned.\n\nThe 3D and normal map displays are both useful, however the zoom controls only last a few seconds and then the map returns to showing only a small section of road ahead. The zoom seems to be controlled partially by proximity to your next turn and partly by local road details, so in urban areas you get about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps they did this for safety, but in that case they shouldn't have provided the controls. In cities this is ok but when you are driving around rural areas it doesn't let you see the area around you, so you can't see if your route is sensible. I have taken to using the browse map view and then moving it as I drive in rural areas. I should be able to zoom the display until it shows a level of detail that is useful to me and it should stay there.\n\nThe text at the bottom of the screen can show the next turn, speed, distance to go, current time, time to go and eta. The choices are configurable, but nothing like the twenty or thirty that Garmin allowed you to choose from six years ago. The text is very small, I have good eyes and I really have to look hard to see the figures. If I'm 400 miles from my next turn I need to know that a lot more than I need to know I'm going to be turning left when I get there. For this sort of price it should be possible to have more control of the information displayed. iGuidance shows even less information and gives you less control. But this is another case where Garmin had a better solution six years ago.\n\nTouching the lower right corner brings up the overview of the route, this should have pan/zoom controls and be in the day/night color scheme. For a trip of several hundred miles it's hardly possile to make out the route on the full VGA display of the X51v.\n\nThe options for finding a destination are easy to use, the ones I have needed were address, city center, POI and point on map. The routing is also non-volatile, so you can stop for the night and resume in the morning. One strange thing is that the previous destinations are stored per map, so if you route to a city on the major roads map and then switch to a more detailed map the destination isn't on the list of recent destinations. The unit exhibits a common problem to north american products, you can't route between countries, you can't ask for a route from Calgary Alberta to Salt Lake City Utah because there isn't a map that has both cities. If you want to route from Bute Montana to Idaho Falls Idaho you have to use the major roads map because the states are on different major maps, west and plains. Worth bearing in mind if you live on a border.\n\nTrip time predictions are very poor. For a trip from Alameda CA to Port Angeles WA the initial prediction was around 18 hours, which means they are using an average speed of around 50mph. That may be reasonable for I880 on a Monday at 9am but it's 50% out for I5 in northern california. The actual duration was about 14 hours including stops for food and fuel and a visit to Hertz in Portland, OR. On smaller roads the errors are much larger. For the Nephi UT to Tonopah, NV the predicted time was over eight hours and the actual trip time was just over four. On major rural roads in Canada with a 60mph limit the trip times appear to be based on a 30mph average.\n\nRouting is fast and the suggested route is certainly in the right direction, but there are issues related to poor choices of road speeds. The software works out the time taken for various routes based on the average speeds for those road classes, but the low freway and major road settings lead it to choose apparently shorter routes through urban areas, this means that it avoids fast roads like US101. In Calgary it routed my south for miles on city streets when I was only half a mile from Deerfoot Trail which is a 65mph road with no stop lights and ultimately becomes I15 at the border. There are also minor weirdnesses, on my daily commute I take I880 south from Oakland CA to San Jose CA, at I238 it directs me to take the off ramp, then then on ramp back to I880. Strangely, if you start from a different place it is able to route you straight down I880 without detouring to the off ramp. Mostly the routes aren't bad though, but Garmin did it better five years ago.\n\nRerouting: If you ask for an alternate route it seeks an alternate for all of the route. So if you are going from Oakland, CA to Seattle, WA and get stuck in traffic trying to get to the freeway and ask for another route it will not only change the entrance onto the freeway, it will also reroute the rest of the trip, so instead of a long day on I5 you may find yourself on a three day drive up the coast. The simple solution is to divert until you are past the problem and then to resubmit the original destination.\n\nThere are some major mapping errors, much of the time in Canada and Montana the mapped road position was tens or even hundreds of yards from the actual position. This causes the software to either show you driving through open fields near the road, or down the wrong side of a freeway, or even down the frontage road hundreds of yards away on the far side of the freeway in Banff national park. This causes some strange voice directions too, like \"turn around when possible\" when you are driving down I15 at 70mph and have been going the right way for hours and have to keep going straight ahead for hours. Most city streets in the US are spot on though. But the maps do seem to be 2-4 years out of date.\n\nPOI problems. The POI list is very lacking. Maybe half to two thirds of gas stations are missing. But worse is the method of selecting POIs. You can look up stores by name, but in the case of the major chains you can get quite a few hits. In places like the San Francisco Bay Area there's a world of difference between somewhere 11 miles down I880 and ten miles across the bay, the first is a 22 mile round trip and the second could be 70. All you get is a list of stores with distances, no address, no direction. So you can't tell which 15 mile distant place they are in. If you select the wrong one and thereby discover that you need to drive thirty miles and cross a toll bridge to get there then there's no back button, you have to go through the whole POI selection process again. This is a method that is not yet ready for the real world. It took me a good ten minutes to discover that the POI list didn't know about the particular version of the store that I thought it should know, I guess I didn't really need it, but then I'm not always in my own back yard. Garmin gives the address and direction of POIs before you commit to one.\n\nIn Death Valley the POI list was positively dangerous. My rented SUV was down to about 100 miles range and Tomtom was telling me to go back through Death Valley to get gas. In the event there was a gas station about 20 miles ahead of me. I passed three more gas stations before I got to Las Vegas, and even there it only listed a few stations. Fortunately they are well signposted.\n\nThe map accuracy and POI list needs a lot of work.\n\nOnly the main map display follows the day/night color scheme, the route map and browsable maps remain in their standard eye wateringly bright colors. A brightness control would be more useful than night colors, but to get to that you have to go to the PDA settings, not something I feel like doing whilst driving.\n\nAt the end of November '05 Tomtom released Navigator version 5.21 for Windows Mobile 5. The behavior of the system has certainly changed. The most noticeable thing is that it now strongly prefers the shortest route for in city 'fastest' routes. Unfortunately that means that it will now route me on surface streets rather than the adjacent interstate. For example Alameda to Emeryville can be achieved almost exclusively at 60mph+ on I880, I980, I580 and I80 and yet the new version chooses the surface streets at 25mph with lights every block. I suppose it can't be expected to know that the route it chooses goes through West Oakland which has more murders than most European countries.\n\nI have contacted Tomtom customer support about the ludicrous average speeds, however they have not contacted me in a month, much less the 24 hours they promissed. Neither Tomtom not Teleatlas have given any sort of response to my eight map error reports, if I am going to all that trouble to accurately describe their errors the least they can do is acknowledge that they have received them, right now I don't know if they are dropping them in the round filling cabinet.\n\nAfter more research I have found many reports of Tele-Atlas inaccuracies (in the UK, for example, major towns missing and impossible directions at some of the bussiest interchanges in the country, like the M4-M25 near Heathrow airport, which may well be the first interchange many foreigners meet in the UK) and even major cities missing from the database.\n\nCompared to iNavigator 2.1.2 Europe: Tomtom update rates are faster, the maps are drawn better, the voice prompts are timed and spaced better. Tomtom shows more useful data than iNavigator, though still not near the standard of old Garmin dedicated units. iNavigator Europe has some serious usability issues related to windows-style menus covering up essential controls like the map zoom and exit buttons. The zoom control on iNavigator is persistant, but not available as often and is very difficult to use whilst driving (on Tomtom the top corners zoom out and in, on iNavigator it's a tiny little control at the bottom center). It may not be fair to compare the US Tomtom (Teleatlas) maps to the European iNavigator (Navtech) maps, but they are about comparable. Both have their issues but will still get you there in the end.\n\nOn balance still a good product, however I am becoming concerned that the hype of the advertising campaigns isn't matched by world class technical teams. But to be fair, most of it works well. And it is very pretty. Overall I haven't seen a better solution.\n\nAfter six months I still haven't seen a better software solution. For me, until there's a significant improvement in the general state of the GPS software market, this is about as good a solution as any if you already own a PDA. But the Garmin integrated units do a lot more than the Tomtom systems and with better routing, POI and navigation features.", "label": 2}

First was Roxio's Easy CD Creator Basic (bundled with a computer I just purchased).  It was supposed to come installed, but did not work.  After countless hours messing with support, on-line forums, etc. It still failed the same way, and never did work.  Sooo, I then did something \"not-so-bright\" and decided to go with Roxio CD Creator 5.0 Platinum.  Second big mistake.  First it required that I download an update from their web-site for it to work correctly (I am running Windows 2000 and parts of this product are incompatible with the operating system - goes for XP also).  I created a couple of coasters (i.e. failed CD burns).  The real grief was when I tried to un-install the product.  On re-boot I received a blue-screen-of-death!  Turns out that Platinum does NOT remove a couple of driver entries from the registry, but DOES remove the drivers from Windows!  According to the various technical forums I visited, this is a know problem with Win2K and XP.  The result is several hours trying to rebuild my system (there is an easy fix, but Roxio doesn't tell you what it is, I found it out on a support forum).  Anyway, in my book, any product that flames your operating system is a virus, not a useful program.  Oh, it is pretty easy to use feature wise, but I have had nothing, but problems getting Platinum to: recognize my CD drive (a Toshiba, go figure), run (after three different installs, taking different paths in the installation it finally came up), un-install!

{"text": "As a longtime user of Quicken, I found Money to be an adequate replacement. Quicken has become more and more \"advertisement-centered,\" which is more than a small annoyance when I paid for the software and not the ads.\nMoney also includes advertisements, but to a much lesser degree. Some of the advertisements are blatant (for financial services) and some are more subtle (check your stocks!).\nWhat I least enjoyed about Money is the \"dummy\" factor: they literally walk you through everything, and have voice help prompts. You can turn off these features, but you have to search the help files to find out how, as they're not readily available. I think it would be a good idea for software programs to offer two 'start-up' options: one for experienced financial software users and one for beginners.\nMy favorite feature of Money is the ease of importing financial information from online services. If you have an American Express card for both yourself and your spouse, you know that Amex assigns two separate card numbers. With Quicken, I would have to manually change the account numbers before downloading the statements for the card; Money allows you to match a download with an existing account, even if the numbers don't match. I also found that Money will import my bank's online statement feature, whereas Quicken would not accomplish this task.\nMoney is a bit different from Quicken - some features are easy to use and some are more difficult or less user-friendly. Keep in mind that no two financial programs are the same when making the transition.", "label": 2}

Many pages have their photographs oriented and displayed vertically onscreen. If a function exists on the installation disc to make them appear horizontally side-by-side I can't find it. Having to turn my head sideways to view these vertical pictures/read the text every so often is sure hard on my neck! LOL\n\n2.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\n\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\n\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\n\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a very good program.

You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud.  That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!\n\nApart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well.  If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear.\n\nHaving said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews.  When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc.) but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking.  That was a surprise and a great relief.\n\nThe opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office.  Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document. If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files.  There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface.  It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it.\n\nSo... all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers.  That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash.  And oddly, I could get to the files in the cloud seamlessly from an iPhone, but not from an iPad.  If I find a way to do that, I'll edit this review.", "label": 2}

And although I finished this game (with nights of frustration), I had to go to the herinteractive.com website for hints from other people who have already finished this game before me. And when you have to find something, you can only get it when you click at a certain angle, and most of the times you must click repeatedly.

{"text": "Here's an unpleasant fact about computers: you can't get one without an Operating System.  Or rather, you can, but you can't really do anything useful with it. An OS contains all the basic software logic that all the other software needs to run. That's why Bill Gates is the richest man in the world: for a long time, he's sold a product that most PC users had no choice but to buy. It's only recently that serious alternatives to Microsoft OSs have become practical for most users.\nFive years ago, this review would have just said, \"Buy the MS OS -- you don't have a real choice.\" Sure, there were alternatives, but compatibility and support issues made them impractical for most people. But that's changing. So now a review of XP boils down to, \"Should you consider an alternative\"?\nNote that I did not say \"a better alternative\". True believers in the competing OSs (and for most users, the competition is either MacOS or Linux) tend to get pretty religious about why their systems are better than Windows. And they're not entirely wrong. But these issues are mostly irrelevent to the average computer user.\nLet's look at the two alternatives one at a time. First, MacOS, which only runs on Apple Macintosh hardware. Mac true believers claim that Mac hardware is fundamentally superior to the Intel/IBM design that most PCs use. And, in point of fact, I think they're probably right. Problem is, that superiority is at a level that just doesn't matter to the typical computer user. Yes, a 1GHz Mac will outperform a 1GHz PC. But even a 1GHz PC is a lot more computing power than most people need.\nAnd this technical superiority is not free. Because they put more work into it, and because a lot of the tech is proprietary, Macs just plain cost more.\nStill, you should strongly consider a Mac if you're totally intimidated by computers. Mac is the only system designed from the ground up with usability in mind.\nThen there's the compatibility issue. That's less of a problem than it used to be. It's still true that most Windows software just isn't available for the Mac. But what software do most people need? They need basic internet software, which the Mac has. And they need office productivity software. Nowadays, that market is also dominated by Microsoft. But MS Office has a Mac version. Sharing Mac files with Windows users used to be a hassle, but Mac OS X does a lot to ease that problem.\nThe second alternative is Linux. The big advantage here is licensing costs. It's illegal to install a single licensed copy of Windows on multiple systems -- and with Windows XP, Microsoft has added feature that make it technically difficult as well. This is not an issue with Linux, which places no restriction at all on multiple installations or duplicating the installation CDs. If you're a programmer, you can even modify a Linux distribution and distribute it as your own product. Which is, of course, why there are so many Linux distributions. And also why people who enjoy fiddling with technology love Linux.\nBut what about everybody else? Is Linux a realistic alternative to Windows XP? I think it depends on who you are, what you need your computer to do, and how important the cost savings are.\nNow, if you absolutely need to run certain Windows software, or your web browser just has to be 100% compatible with Internet Explorer, than Linux is just not an alternative. The compatibility gap between Windows and Linux is getting smaller every day, but it's still pretty big. And if something you need to do falls in the gap, you're stuck. And the gap will never close completely. For example, sharing word processor files will never be seamless and foolproof, unless you can somehow make the word processor work under Linux -- WP file formats are just too unstructured and complex.\nOn the other hand, if you're on a budget and compatibility is not an issue, Linux is a very serious alternative to Windows. This is especially true if you're in a position to burn your own installation CDs, either from borrowed originals or ISO images freely -- and legally -- available on the net. Amazon doesn't allow reviewers to post URLs, but ISO images are not hard to find, using your favorite web search engine.\nAs I mentioned, there are a lot of different Linux distributions. Most of my own experience is with Red Hat, which has the largest user community in English-speaking countries, and is thus on the top of my recommended list.\nI've also been intrigued by Lycoris Linux, though I haven't gotten round to trying it. Most Linux distributions are made by and for techies, so they throw in every piece of free software a techie might want to play with. Lycoris focuses on providing a simple coherent package for the typical computer user.", "label": 2}

For example, I used the file name \"JCA-CD101\" for \"Johnny Cash American Series\", CD1, Song 1; and similaryly, \"JCA-CD102\" for song 2, etc.  When you sort these names on your computer and in a play list they are shown in the proper sorting order.  Unforunately, Roxio jumbles all this filename (information) together and comes up with some numeric equivalent, and definitely not in the alphanumeric order I want.\nWhen I was (not easily) able to contact someone at Roxio their only suggestion was for me to not use alphbetic characters in my file names.  Now isn't that silly.

That is very cool.  If it were not for this labor saving feature I never would have bought the software.\n\nNow for the bad news:  Once you download all the data you have to assign it to a category.  There is nothing wrong with that but Microsoft could have made it easier.  For instance, I buy a lot of gas from the same place and I charge it to my AMEX.  It would be really nice if I could tell Money, \"When you see a charge from this place add it to this category\".  According to Microsoft's press package there is an \"Auto-Categorization\" function but it doesn't appear to be customizable and it didn't work for the vast majority of my transactions.  If there is a way to customize it I haven't discovered it yet but I've only used the software a couple of nights.\n\nOn the other hand, I spent a good bit of time looking around the on-line help with no success.

Or perhaps it is the software that lacks depth.\n\nAnother problem is when you download bank account and credit card information.  If you have $1,000 in credit card charges and you pay off your credit card with a $1,000 check then you end up with all the credit card charges plus the check so it looks as if you have $2,000 in expenses.  That wouldn't be a problem if I could tell Money not to put the credit card charge in any category but if you don't assign it then you have to keep $1,000 balance of un-categorized charges which is messy.

Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this \"revolutionary new Bible\" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.\n\nGLO features:\n\n++  450+ Virtual Tours\n  These are 360-degree tours of \"modern-day and re-created\" ancient biblical locations.\"\n\n++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos\n  You'll be able to enjoy the \"In His Shoes\" HD interactive documentary.\n\n++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos\n  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.\n\n++  7,500+ Articles\n  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan\n\nTake for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.\n\n++  650+ Works of Art\n\n++  Integration with the best web content\n\n++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program\n\n++  Concise, compact organization through five \"lenses\"\n\n++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study\n\nLENSES:\n\nBIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.\n\nTIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation\n\nMyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and \"reading plans.\"\n\nMEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.\n\nATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger \"picture\" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.\n\nTOPICAL:  Here you can \"quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.\"\n\nThere are three DVDs in this packet.  You can now install it on both Windows and Mac systems.  Below are the system requirements.\n\nPC System Requirements:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 operating system with latest service pack installed\n\nDuel core processor\n\n1GB RAM for Microsoft Windows XP, or 2GB RAM for Vista or Window 7\n\nAt lease 1GB of free hard disk space, 18GB for full media install\n\nVideo card with Microsoft DirectX 9 support\n\nInternet Connection\n\nDVD-ROM drive\n\nMac System Requirements\n\nIntel-Based Mac\n\nMac OS 10.5.8 (Leopard) or higher\n\n2GB RAM\n\nAt least 200MB of free hard disk space, 18 GB for full media install\n\nInternet Connection\n\nDVD-ROM drive\n\nThis is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I believe that many of the bad reviews were before the update that National Geographic did.  This is truly a wealth of information, and quite remarkable software.  My copy installed flawlessly onto my hard drive.  If you're wondering if this will work for you or not, here's what I think you need:\n\n1)  A decent computer-- If your computer can be found on on an advertisement in National Geographic from the 80s or 90s, this software probably won't run too smoothly on your system.  So don't say that these CDs suck if your computer once survived Y2K.\n2)  Follow the instructions --([...] )Their website tell you to insert disc 1, then go to preferences and update the software.  After doing that there is a button that says to install it to the hard drive.  It lets you choose where you want to install it, and after about 5-7 hours with vigilance to swap out the discs (real time depend on your computer), your software will be installed.  No tricks involved if you just update the software from the start.  Very easy.\n3)  I expected there to be at least three things, but there's not.  It's quite simple.\n\nI am overwhelmingly satisfied with this purchase.  I wish I could take a few days off just to catch up on some National Geographic reading, but instead I will enjoy the sparse moments with this software at random times over times over the next several years.  This would make for a great gift, a great resource, a great hobby if you had all day to read.\n\nNegatives:  The only thing that would make this better in my opinion is if they could have some sort of side scroller that would show the different pages (smaller) so that you wouldn't have to clink each page one by one just to see what's on it.  Also, they need to solve the problem with the pages that need to be rotated 90 degrees to see the content.\n\n**Bonus tip:  Many people have mentioned that you cannot get the images directly from the articles, however, if you have Vista or Windows 7 this problem is solved with the \"snipping tool\".  Very easy to grab images if you would ever need to.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I do tech support and for the last week or two practically all the calls have been about windows XP.  It is a very powerful operating system, a monster that can do a lot... that is a lot of things the avg person doesn't need.\nThis is basically a punched up 2000 system with some nice bells and balloons.  The best feature in my opinion is the compatibility mode allowing old programs to run in their own enviorments.  It is very useful... But will it work regularly?\nThe interface is familar with anyone familar with windows 2000 and its true purpose is the final death and destruction of DOS.  People have been predicting DOS's death the same way they have predicted COBOL's death.  We shall see.  The 640k memory barrier is well gone but I see basically a monster of an operating system that pushes users where they may not want or need to go.  For the professional user this is less of a problem but for the home user it is a headache.  Even the built in firewall will force people to learn about ports, or get them to go back to 98. (A better OS then anybody give it credit for.)\nThis is the attempt to force feed the type of stuff that a more technical user might use on the home user.  If it was released in about 10 years when a full generation had used home PC's on a regular basic it would be an easy and useful transition, however the way this system takes over your machine makes it a monster that is not really needed.\nIf you are a home user or if you have an older machine, do yourself a favor and stick with what you have.  If you just have to have a more powerfull machine to download and own every video and MP3 in existance, be prepared to learn more than you want to.\nToo Much too soon for too many.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I've used PaperPort 7.0 for many years to store scanned images of my financial data.  My biggest reason for upgrading from 7.0 to 9.0 was because PaperPort 9.0 can now save files as Adobe Acrobat PDF files.  It can also convert existing PaperPort MAX files to PDF via the Save As function.  So far, this is what I've found:\nIrritations:  First, PaperPort 9.0 insists on creating a folder in My Documents entitled \"My PaperPort Documents.\"  You can cosmetically rename it WITHIN PaperPort to anything you want.  But, you can't actually change the name that Windows itself shows and you can't delete it (except via a Registry hack).  You can delete everything out of the folder and use whatever other folders you want, but still, it's irritating that the folder exists.  Another irritation is with the version numbering.  I actually downloaded the upgrade from Scansoft's site.  According to their site, with the latest Service Pack (SP-2), the latest version should be \"9.0, SP-2 (9.0.0.503).\"  In my case, under Help -> About PaperPort, I show a version of \"9.0 (9.1.0.497).\"  So, I'm not sure what I have (I'm missing the SP-2 designation, but I have a higher version number).  PaperPort 9.0 does have a \"Get Latest Updates\" function under Help -> ScanSoft on the Web, and it says I'm fully up-to-date.  So, I'm a tad confused.\nProblems:  The first glitch I ran into was when I was batch converting folders full of MAX files to PDF files.  In a few cases, the new files didn't name correctly, so I had to copy the old names and paste them on the new documents.  That problem seems to be related to the existence of periods in the document names.  The next, and more serious, problem is that it doesn't handle multiple page printing of PDFs properly.  I tried printing some stacks of PDFs to my Tektronix Phaser 740 Postscript color laser printer (on my network (not shared)). Stacks of 8 and 6 pages just timed out. A single page PDF prints fine. If I duplicate twice that properly-printing page and either stack and print those two pages or just print the two pages as one operation, the first page prints, but the second doesn't. Any time a page prints, it's followed by a printed Postscript \"ERROR: ioerror, OFFENDING COMMAND: image\" page.  I'm assuming this is what's stopping multiple page PDFs from printing.\nFrom within Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1, I can print the smaller PDFs fine (the 6 and 8 page ones still time out).\nIf I unstack objects and separately print each page in it's own operation, I can get everything printed (with a doubling of used pages since each page generates that error page). Also, if I re-convert the PDF back to a MAX file, it prints fine.  For instance, I re-converted that non-printing 8 page PDF stack (about 3.9MB) to a MAX stack (about 4.5MB).  It printed in about 13 minutes (which seems reasonable for that file size).  So, it is possible to work around this problem.\nAnother problem was mentioned by j. zehala, here.  PaperPort's ScanDirect program allows you to scan a document directly to other applications (no need to open up PaperPort).  Though it offers the theoretical capability to scan directly to my copy of Outlook, the file it attaches to the email doesn't arrive with an extension and there doesn't seem to be any way to rename it. Thus, Windows won't open the attachment.  The work-around I found was to scan the document into Paperport and then just drag it onto an email.  The other problem j. zehala mentions (Print to PDF) I can't reproduce:  with PaperPort set to default to PDFs, telling a program to print using one of PaperPort's print drivers puts the file right in the last folder used in PaperPort (which is where the program will open).\nIn general, I'm fairly satisfied with the program.  Once I get the printing problem solved, I'll be very satisfied.  But, whatever you do, make sure you either go to Scansoft's web site or do the \"Get Latest Updates\" from within the program itself.  As of this writing, SP-2 is out and it's supposed to correct many problems.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I started using Smartdraw shortly after the now defunct Micrografx discontinued Windows Draw! I am also a veteran chemical engineer well versed in the use of CAD packages. Smartdraw beautifully bridges the vast void that exists between expensive CAD packages typically used to produce abstract vector-based process drawings and the high-end raster graphics packages more typical of illustrations and graphics.\n\nIf you don't have the money to spend on CAD, nor the desire to learn what amounts to be very steep learning curve packages like Photoshop, but still need a way to communicate your data, ideas and concepts in a manner that will wow your audience (in spite of limited artistic skills), then give this software a shot.\n\nThe developers have continued to make subtle but substantial improvements with the package. Some highlights include the extensive symbol and graphics libraries that make assembly of rich illustrations trivial. The templates that come with this package are phenomenal as well. You can spend a couple hours just looking at all the examples and getting ideas from them. The smart graphs are a killer way to take the admittedly powerful tools in Excel up a notch.\n\nEven though Smartdraw provides powerful and extensive exporting functionality, it is a simple one-click affair to get your work into Microsft office and it goes out of its way to make the integration (back and forth for those last minute edits) seemless.\nFor those who dare to do more, the granularity of the editing tools is all there, with and endless array of gradients, line, pattern, etc. that can be used to create custom, polished graphics. You can even set up your own templates along with common blocks and setting like I do and use them for common work.\n\nRecently, they've jumped on the cloud wagon and provide an iOS app that makes work accessible and easier to manage. This has saved me already from an accidental file deletion.\n\nAs a process engineer, my work can be abstract and well, boring to many folks. Smartdraw changes that, making my drawings come to life and intuitive to casual observers given the nature of the graphics vs. simple CAD symbols. It's so simple to combine photos and vector graphics into one and kick off a pdf that anyone can view that you will be hearing \"how did you do that\" a lot.\nThe package does take some time getting used to. While the ribbon interface is done well, some settings and features can be a bit quirky. I still have trouble with snaps versus grid specs. And a couple pet peeves remain like if you rotate a symbol, it will cause connected lie arrows to rotate as well. There are work-abounds but it's still annoying.\n\nIn my work, Office, AutoCAD and Smartdraw are the keys to my productivity. I'd say that puts Smartdraw in some good company and places a whole lot of power into folks like me with limited budget and artistic skills to boot. Try the trial, you have nothing to lose.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I attended a private school when I was younger and had 2 years of German language.  Later, I switched to a public school and the language receded into my subconscious since I had no one to communicate with.\n\nThroughout the years, I made several attempts to re-learn the language and gave up in frustration.  I wanted to be able to think in German again, but the teaching methods created a translation process in my mind.  Finally, I decided to give Rosetta Stone a try and have completed levels 1 through 3.\n\nThis program helps build a solid foundation of the language because you are learning through association, not translation.  The lessons help you develop both spoken and written language.  As I progressed with the lessons, the content made sense and I found the Adaptive Recall sessions to be extremely helpful in retaining what I had learned.\n\nI also noticed significant improvement in my comprehension and understanding of the language.  And, when exposed to German (outside of the software), I was naturally isolating unfamiliar words and determining the context to accurately interpret the meaning.  (Which I later verified by looking up the unfamiliar words.)\n\nThe only negative that I found with this program is with the voice recognition technology.  It works well for the most part, however it has not been perfected yet.  It works by comparing sound patterns.  So if the native speaker uses a different tone or speed for a particular phrase, you must replicate that exactly or the software won't recognize that it's correct.\n\nSometimes I pronounced a phrase precisely and had to endure several frustrating attempts for the software to acknowledge this.  Other times, I said the wrong phrase, but the software considered it correct because the tone and speed matched the native speaker.  (For example, the phrase was informal \"Was machst du gern\" but I said formal \"Was machen Sie gern\".)\n\nI was so pleased with the results of this program that I later bought Rosetta Stone Italian levels 1 through 3.  I highly recommend Rosetta Stone for building a solid foundation of a language and if you would like to think in that language, rather than have a translation process in your mind.", "label": 1}

They do do live updates every once in a while so who knows maybe one day these issues will be fixed. This was the cheapest software I could find and I'm just getting started editing so this is okay for beginners or people how don't edit often to get started to see if they'd want to invest more money into video editing but if you know what you're doing and are seriously committed to editing I'd recommend investing in better software.", "label": 2}
{"text": "My son loved the Serene Screen screensaver I had installed on my old computer, so when we purchased a new system I decided to give this product a try.  It advertises 40+ fishes, the ability to 'tap' the screen, feed the fish, etc.\n\nInstallation was uneventful, and my son eagerly waited as I launched the software.\n\nsome quick observations:\n\nFirst off, the backgrounds stink.  They are extremely unrealistic...I think another reviewer mentioned that already.\n\nThe fish have a tendency to 'swim' off the screen...and not return.  There were several instances where there were NO fish on the screen at all.\n\nThe scale of the fish seems a bit off--some fish were MUCH larger than others, and there is little sense of depth when the fish \"swim away\" from you.\n\nFish movement seems jerky and unrealistic.\n\n'Tapping' on the screen seems to work, as some of the fish turn toward the screen.  'Feeding' them seems to have some effect, but not what you would expect.\n\nThis product went back under their 30-day refund policy...and Serene Screen is now on the new computer.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a good program with many useful features.  I use it primarily for hiking and backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas.  The excellent quality maps that I can print out are perfect to use in conjunction with my GPS receiver.  You can't download the topo maps into the GPSr, but that's okay since the GPSr has such a small screen (and I prefer having a paper map in hand when hiking).  The program also lets me plot courses along trails and calculate hiking distances.  The elevation profile tool has been very handy and there is an option to include the profile at the bottom of a map print out.  My only complaint is that the USGS maps used by the program do not have all of the trails that other paper maps include (but then again, I've found a few trails in this program that aren't on some of my other paper maps).  I also save waypoints and courses to a \".gpx\" file which I can then import into Google Earth to get a better feel for terrain and vegetation. I give it 4/5 Star because it is not perfect (see above complaint) but it is close.  Overall, I highly recommend this program for anyone who enjoys hiking in California's mountains.", "label": 1}

I've been trying to self-teach since May, and although I've found a good system for learning kanji I still struggle to work up the motivation to learn grammar. I find the brevity of the chapters to be refreshing and easy to work through.\n\nThe text seems to be well researched. It doesn't make the mistake of telling you that \"anata\" can be used just like we use \"you,\" for example (one thing I didn't like about my old textbook; some of the advice and info was outdated).\n\nChapters are followed with vocabulary and concept reviews, allowing you to practice what you've learned. You can even choose to display the answers/questions in Japanese or English. The chapters are interspersed with cultural notes that explain how some things work in Japan. There are numerous example sentences, and you can click on them to hear them read aloud by native speakers.\n\nTo make it more accessible for beginners, everything (so far) is written using kana. I already know some basic kanji, so I would have liked the option to switch to kanji, but that's a minor gripe. The interface is simple and easy to use. I think I'll continue to use this and refer to it from time to time. This is a useful tool for absolute beginners.", "label": 1}

I didn't really feel like I was learning or doing anything until well into the lessons.  She also seemed to wander off course to much for my liking.\n\nI also found that she didn't prep me well enough for each lesson by telling me what files I needed and setting up Dreamweaver for each lesson.  I was frequently going to the DVD's Assets folder to get files that were missing from the lessons.  Luckily I have been using Dreamweaver long enough to know how to troubleshoot and find the missing parts.

{"text": "Relative to many of the other languages offered through Rosetta Stone, the Mandarin package is very good. Rosetta presents all material using the continuous tense (e.g., \"The boy is running;\" \"The girl is laughing.\") -- this is not conducive to learning how to conjugate verbs, which, in my mind, would make learning how to effectively use a lanuage very difficult. But in Mandarin, there is no conjugation of verbs, which makes learning through the continuous tense just fine.\n\nI have already studied Mandarin for a few years and lived in Beijing for a few more. I purchased this set with the goal of improving my reading and writing skills. In terms of reading, it's not bad -- definiately beats the tradiitonal learning method of going through blocks of text, dictionary in hand (using a dictionary to look up Chinese words can be very time consuming). That said, the software doesn't present any opportunities to practice reading more than one sentence at a time, or something that is out of context (the true test of lanuage mastery). As for writing, this package is useless. There is no input method for Chinese characters.\n\nSo, for learning how to speak and improve pronunciation, I would say this series isn't too bad.

When I find an included report that I want to use, it lets me customize it (that's good), but it saves my changes to the included report (that's bad!!). I should be able to change any report, but then I should have to save it as a different / favorite report.

It boasts of good networking options, as well as built-in Firewall internet security; yet, its value-for-money is suspect.\nInstallation is time-consuming: budget one hundred minutes for it.

Again, bear in mind that Windows XP may compel you to spend more on updating other applications that would not run on it.

Most of the added features are big, bulky gewgaws like Windows Media Player 7, which sports quite possibly the most insipid user interface of any application I've used since 1986, and is impossible to remove once it is installed. Internet Explorer 5.5 is included, except that it's not the _final_ build, so you'll have to go to Microsoft's web site and download an 11 megabyte IE upgrade the instant you install WinMe.\nOld-school folks who are into DOS games and apps will find that Windows Me has completely removed the \"real mode\" DOS startup option, so you are effectively screwed there. You can get creative and make boot disks with some files from Windows 98, but it's ridiculous that this is even necessary. Windows Me is still running on top of a 16-bit DOS operating system; Microsoft is just trying to make their product look better by hiding that fact, to the detriment of us all. No one is helped by the removal of a menu option to boot to real-mode DOS. NO ONE.\nProfessionals who tinker with Photoshop or other development tools are advised to get Windows 2000. It's incredibly stable. Gamers and novice home users are advised to stick with or obtain Windows 98 Second Edition. There is absolutely no reason to get Windows Me.

{"text": "After reading all of these 5 star reviews, I decided to buy a copy of Zoombinis Logical Journey for my 8 year old boy. Once I successfully installed the game, I left the rest to my son. Two minutes later, he came up to me and said he didn't know what to do. I went back to the screen and all I saw was a little ship, some mountains and what looked like little comical body parts to build a character. There were absolutely NO instruction on the screen. The makers expected a little 8 year old kid to know that they should hit the pink hidden questionmark in the corner for instructions. Once clicked, it puts confusing instructions (confusing for little kids) using \"big\" words such as attributes and other words a little kid needs to ask mom define. Once I figured out that you needed to build 16 different Zoombinis, the little characters are taken to another screen where the player needs to put them in a certain order. If the player fails to do this, he/she loses all of the little Zoombinis except for 3 or 4 out of the original 16 that were created. And thats it...the game ends.\n\nWhen a player does complete the task required, they don't get a \"good job\" or \"Yay! you did it!\" Instead the game exclaims, \"And the zoombinis move on.\" Absolutely no motivation or reward to congratulate the player on a job well done.\n\nOn top of that, there is no \"Save Game\" button. Lucky for me, my older son knew that one needs to press Ctrl+S to save the game.\n\nThe \"no numbers required -- all logic\" motto caught my eye when I was looking for a game to purchase. THERE IS ONLY ONE CHALLENGE - The player needs to put the Zoombinis in a certain order where the an \"attribute\" of the next Zoombini is the same as a Zoombini previous to it. This idea is followed through the entire game except for a couple of mini games. The only difference between levels is the color or characters that need help in completing a task. For example, the Zoombinis need to cross a river. In order to do this, they have to hop on some turtles' shells to get the other side. Put the Zoombinis in a specific order (explained before). The next level would be a frog that will only row the boat if the Zoombinis put themselves in a certain order - except this time they need to put themselves in an order in such a manner that they form a rectangle. Very little variation.\n\nWorst game ever created. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy a different game.", "label": 0}

{"text": "While it's a definite step up from 98 and NT 4.0, it still has some serious flaws.  It is certainly more stable than either of those two versions of Windows, but crashes and \"maintenance reboots\" are still a common problem; particularly with graphics software and games.  DirectX support is buggy and unstable. Rebooting at least once a week is mandatory due to the archaic memory management and flawed garbage handling; which can result in massive system lag if allowed to go too long between reboots.  Networking is still kludgy and poorly designed; and takes too long to set up and debug.  Better than NT 4.0, but not by much.\nHardware recognition is good for commonly used components such as consumer-level video and sound cards; but less than adequate for more specialized hardware, such as CD-RWs and even some types of printers.  Legacy support is almost non-existent.  Win2k Pro is also a serious resource hog.  Expect to have to upgrade quite a lot of your hardware, as you'll need nearly twice the memory and processor power.  The minimum requirement is 64 megs on a P-133 processor.  I'm running a P-166 with 128 megs and i quickly run out of resources.  I'd say the minimum for this OS is 128 megs on a P2-300/K6-2 300; and quite a bit more if you are doing graphics work or need to run more than two or three large applications at a time.  The system requirements indicate 650 Mb of disk space for a typical installation, my experience is closer to 800 Mb, unless you plan to serious limit functionality.\nMultimedia, Java, and system tools are rudimentary and buggy; you'll be better off going with third-party software for most of these functions.  Particularly if you are planning to do any software development.  The user interface is improved, but still kludgy in many areas -- bordering on counter-intuitive,  particularly for system administration -- and the Wizards are slow and cumbersome.  Not to mention that Microsoft didn't provide access to some of the most useful tools (through start menu, desktop, or control panel shortcuts), and you'll have to go hunting through the system directory to find them (and you better know what you're looking for since many of the names are seriously non-intuitive).\nIf you need an easy to learn system for your office that won't get too much high-stress use, and you can afford the required upgrades, then Windows 2000 Professional is probably a good way to go.  If stability, upgrade costs, and communication are high priorities, and you don't mind a slightly higher learning curve, check out some of the recent Linux-based office solution packages.", "label": 2}

I read the Nancy Drew books as a kid, so when I found out about the PC games I decided to take a chance. I've solved 3 other ND games (Phantom of Venice, The Final Scene, and one other that I can't remember lol) but this one was my least favorite. I thought there was way too much history in this one, so unless you want your brain stuffed with lots of information about the Maya culture, or you're a history buff, I would stay away from this one. I found the story to be uninteresting, unlike some of the other ND games I've played. (I'm looking at you White Wolf of Icicle Creek!) There was no real sense of suspense or danger. The graphics were good, but that was about the only thing. Also, if you don't like writing tons of stuff down to help you remember, don't buy this game! There also seemed to be a lot of back tracking that you had to do. So. Final verdict? There are better ND games out there, and if you are a hardcore ND fan, that's the only reason I would buy this game. If you are new to the series, I'd recommend White Wolf of Icicle Creek or another ND title. This one was just...eh...overall, I would give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me. It just doesn't deserve a 4 or 5 star rating. Hopefully Treasure in the Royal Tower is better then this one.", "label": 2}

It's pretty complete in its coverage of Lightroom basics, and differences from Lightroom 2; the only real issue I have is with the pacing. And that's not a real complaint about the product; it's more of a personal preference.\n\nWhat you get in the package is a slim volume of 100 pages, about half of which discuss Lightroom and photography in general terms; the remaining 50 pages are divided between notes on setting preferences in Lightroom and tables of keystroke shortcuts. Given that the booklet is glued into the packaging, it's not exactly a handy references. The bulk of the course, though, is on a disk that contains (as noted in the description) a full 10 hours of video lessons.\n\nThe lessons are divided up functionally in a manner that reflects Lightrooom's functional division- the first section is devoted to importing photos, followed by a section on the Library function. Each section is in turn divided into lessons covering one or two detailed areas. You can play all the sections and lessons in order, or pick and choose as you like. I began by playing straight through the first two sections (over two separate sessions) and picked up a lot of new and useful information about using Lightroom 3. Each lesson involves watching an expert carry out some function while narrating exactly what he's doing. The demonstrations and accompanying narration afre very clear, and made it easy for me to perform the same actions on my own. There's also a \"watch and work\" mode, in which you can shrink the video window down and try an example on your own in Lightroom, using supplied data files. Very nice.\n\nWhat I particularly liked was the us of professional photographers, rather than trainers, to present the material. The result is a real-world approach, in which the instructor both demonstrates the full range of options for some piece (like importing) and then explains exactly how he uses this in his own workflow. What you get is not a theoretical exploration of how a piece of software could be used, but a real demonstration of how it's being used by someone working in the field. Of course, that can be a drawback, too; one particular photographer's idiosyncratic methods may not be best for you. But I think this program manages to avoid that, but presenting the full range of possible approaches before the instructor gives his personal preference.\n\nThe one problem I do have with the course is, I suppose, unavoidable in this sort of presentation, and that's that the videos are fixed in duration and what's covered. Going through everything is going to take you the full 10 hours, at a minimum. You may look ahead to one chapter for something you're specifically interested in, only to discover after watching it through that what you really need is in a different chapter. That's why I generally prefer a text and image based approach. For me, at least, reading is several times faster than listening. But as I say, that's just my personal preference. For many, if not most new users, this may be one of the best ways to learn enough yo get started managing workflow with LR3.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I am a physicist/software developer, not an architect, and have experience with Punch Platinum (Punch), Better Homes and Garden Suite 6 (BHG), and DesignWorkshop Lite (DWL).\n\nNone of these are architectural design packages -- for that you'd pay big bucks and a lot of learning time.  Rather, these are perspective drawing packages.  DWL is in a slightly different category being closest to a true 3D modeling application.  It is the only one that builds 3d objects from fundamentals, importing house objects from libraries.  Hence, it takes more time to get going.\n\nBHG and Punch are great for rapid prototyping, allowing you to construct a semblance of a home in just minutes.  Punch has a big advantage in that it uses the popular OpenGL rendering engine.  It also has a true 3d CAD capability to build unique objects that can be integrated into the design.  Objects can be 'grouped' to form compound onbjects, but this capability is not available for their house objects, like walls and roofs.\n\nBHG claims CAD tools, but they are simply 2D drawing tools -- rather useless as a design tool.  I found BHG too limiting to use -- could not do multi-level flooring, etc.  Punch, on the other hand seemed to do most of what I wanted.\n\nOne caveat for dealing with additions or remodeling:  these packages, especially BHG, may not be able to model pre-existing structures accurately enough.\n\nHere's my bottom line:\n\nBHG: useful only as a concept designer for very traditional homes.  It's single advantage is easy to use, but that feature is comparable to Punch which adds much more capability.\n\nPunch: has true 3D capability as well as good object design based on OpenGL software.  I regret it doesnt carry object design techniques, like grouping, over to the home oriented objects.\n\nDWL is free and perhaps the most sophisticated at 3D design.  It is a bit weaker on rapid prototyping and to do anything serious, you may need to buy the upgrade.  DWL is cross-platform software, running on both Mac and Windows, and so it suffers from minor oddities in the GUI.", "label": 2}

I eventually found out how to load this feature after searching the net for 3 hours!!\nAs far as I am concerned the backup feature is one of the most important features in the operating system.

Maybe they are trying to get users to but the more expensive \"Pro\" Edition when they eventually get tired of looking for this feature? I almost did.\nFor those who want to install this feature - here is the procedure. Dont go to microsoft for help or you will be wasting your time.\n  Hidden deep in the recesses of the Windows XP Home Edition CD lies the actual installation program that you need to put the Backup Utility on your computer.  Simply insert the XP CD, and run NTBACKUP.MSI (it might look like just \"Ntbackup\") program from the folder D:\\Valueadd\\msft\\ntbackup where D: is the letter of your CD drive.

{"text": "This game is hokier than the classic version.  The dialouge between the ACME agents is somewhat painful, albeit usually educational.  For those who are looking to walk down memory lane, you may be disappointed.  Unlike the old games where you would hunt down minions, & work your way up the ranks to hunting Carmen herself, this is 1 overarching case made up of several mini missions.  I actually like that take on the game.  The interface is completely different now as well.  Rather than questioning witnesses and getting clues of the next step, the game mostly requires the agents to click on hotspots and retrieve scraps of notes that are, well, rather blunt.  Gone are the days of a slow-build to revealing the solution with a broad clue that applies to a region and more specific clues that eventually narrow down the location you need.\n\nEach mini-mission takes approximately 30 minutes and there is apparently no way to save the game until the mission has been completed.  For that matter, even after certain missions have been completed, the game will not save.  It could not be more frustrating to keep replaying the same missions over and over.\n\nIn sum, this game appears to be dumbed down quite a bit from many of the other mystery/problem solving games out there.  The key clues needed to solve many of the puzzles are automatically put front and center after the puzzle has been selected so it takes little thought to solve them.  It's also impossible to lose Carmen's trail.  All the player has to do is contact the chief and she just point blank tells you \"Go here.  Do this.\"  I think the game would be more challenging (and educational) if the Chief would give hints, perhaps for security purposes.  Maybe for younger players, that direct approach is necessary, but I find it hard to believe that 12 year-olds need to be so directly walked through the story.\n\nFinally, please note that this game was copyrighted in 2001, so on a visit to New York City, you will see the Twin Towers, not only standing, but as a point of discussion.", "label": 0}

{"text": "GLO is a visually stunning bible program with so much to offer. Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.\n\nGLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.\n\nGLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\n\nBe forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.\n\nThe one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.\n\nI'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.\n\nGLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.", "label": 1}

In fact, some of them are so simple and shallow that it's hard to believe there isn't more to them that is inaccessible somehow due to a programming flaw.  The butterfly selector is confusing and requires adult assistance.  The program comes with two levels of play, and the level selector pops up anytime the mouse nears the bottom of the screen.  This is bad because many of the child's activity zones are also located at the bottom of the screen.  This means the level selector gets launched inadvertently every few minutes.  The selector then covers up the section of the screen that the child is playing with.  In addition, the level selector doesn't work according to the steps laid out in the directions.  My husband and I are both multimedia developers and neither of us can figure this selector out.  Our son enjoys 2 of the 6 activities, so I feel we got somewhat of our money's-worth.

It's not just a bunch of memorizing words, in Human Japanese you are actually taught how and when to use the words. Every Japanese word in the book is clickable and will pronounce it for you. Hearing it really helps. I like how the program breaks it up too, you go from learning vocab, to some culture information, to some new Hiragana/Katakana/etc. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting, and helps a lot because you are slowly introduced into each topic, rather than thrown in and expected to memorize everything. Definitely a great program! Though you can get the digital download for a bit cheaper (I think I paid $19 on the Human Japanese website) if you don't care about having the hard copy of the disc.

Instead, it functions more as an intrusion detection system. It is easy to install, and fairly easy to configure, but that's about all it does. It certainly stops low-level attacks, like port 80 scans, but if you get a more involved probe, like a SubSeven probe, BlackIce Defender doesn't block it. Instead, it lets the probe happen, then tells you that someone was looking for something but couldn't find it. That's kind of like having a car alarm that tells you when someone is checking out your car but decided it wasn't worth stealing (okay, it's not a perfect analogy).\nSure, you can block specific IP addresses, or allow only certain IP addresses ... but if you want to block every SubSeven probe, for example, you have to wait to be probed, then tell BlackIce not to let that person through again. Small consolation. Also, the interface that displays the most recent attacks is somewhat buggy - it wasn't unusual for me to be paging through attacks, blocking IP addresses who had probed me, when the list would suddenly shrink to the last 20 or 30 addresses.

Low looks terrible, medium looks ok and high looks fair.\nIt's mainly intended for emailing these clips. Sometimes I like to make video clips, burn them to a CD/Zip disk and send to friends that way to preserve quality and sound. I also prefer Real Player files, over Windows Media.\nThe System Restore feature isn't all it's cracked up to be: It only does around 1-2 entries every few days. It's not very effective/reliable. For example with WildFile's GoBack(TM), you can easily go to virtually any day/time in your history log and restore your PC to exactly the way it was. If your PC was not running, then at start-up it has a restore option whereas on Windows System Restore, it's limited to two or three entries every few days, and it only works as long as Windows does.\nThe \"new and improved\" My Pictures is pretty nice. It lets you thumbnail your photo's without having to click them to see them. You can preview them now. Boot-up and shut-down times on my pc are extremely quicker than Windows 98 SE. I have a 850Mhz PIII w/384MB of RAM.\nFinally, MSIE 5.5, Outlook 5.5, MSN Messenger 3.01, and Windows Media Player 7.0: Are all FREE downlaods from Windows Update. And don't let these features pursuade you to Windows Me. I also didn't notice any difference with Defrag and ScanDisk. it's still the same old boring program, was hoping it would be more \"Me-ish\" and colorful.\nOverall, I'm not too impressed with Windows Me. One reviewer once said this was like Windows 98 3rd Edition. For the most part, everything is laid ou the same. I only have Me because I got a FREE copy, otherwise I would stay with Windows 98.", "label": 0}

As a dedicated Mac user, unfortunely I have to say Encarta is the best. World map from Encarta is top notch. You can rotate the globe, zoom in and zoom out. Let say I am doing a research paper on a town named Mecca. Not only Encarta list the article part and useful links, but also showing where is it in the map. When you click on the map, the map becomes fully interactive so that I can zoom out several steps to find out where exactly in the globe is this town located. Again it's that same globe that is rotatible at any direction by click, hold and drag. It utilizes fully the 3D engine to render the globe on the fly. The maps on both World Book and Encyclopedia Britannica are very dull and not very detail. They are pure 2D images and they are small. Encyclopedia Britannica 2004 is very slow. It seems like the programmers are using Java to write it and port it to both PC and Mac. This method saves time and cost in writing for both platforms but sacrifice performance. Where as World Book is written from the ground up just for Mac (the same goes with PC). World Book is the fastest because of its native OS coding (the same goes with Encarta on PC). But World Book's contents are the less of the three. Many contents are not found. After hearing everyone here said how slower the Encyclopedia Britannica 2005 is, I decide not to upgrade. I gave three stars for the last version because it contains more articles than World Book. And two stars less for OK maps and slow performance. Slowness is the biggest drawback for this software.

{"text": "There was a lot of reluctance amongst old time MS Office users at the idea of 'renting' Office for an annual fee to Microsoft. It felt like MS was trying to shore up into income stream by turning us into subscribers rather than traditional consumers (because they were and are). But if you consider this\n\n365 comes with ALL the office products\n365 gives you the very latest version of the office products at all times\n365 gives you FIVE separate licenses for 5 computers or devices\n365 gives each of your FIVE licensees 1 TB or OneDrive Storage\nOneDrive Storage is fully integrated into Windows 8 & Windows 10. It also works on iOS...\n\nThese features are neat in and of themselves. I'd also argue it makes 365 a bit of a bargain. Some might argue that owning Office would be cheaper over the long term but I'd have to disagree. 5 licenses covering Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook etc. run about $1000 or so. And eventually you will want to upgrade - some people say you don't have to but as someone who has used Word and Excel since version 1.0...I'd say most full-point version upgrades ARE worth it if you can afford it. And with 365...you've got it.\n\nYou can get a personal edition with 1 license for less.\n\nHome editions can be found on sale for around $70 a year sometimes. You can buy 4 of them and take care of ALL MS Office needs and your cloud storage for $280 for 4 years like I did.\n\nI've had a long and sometimes troubled relationship with MS products dating back to the 80s. I think I've tasted the good, the bad, and the super ugly they've produced over the years and am hardly a cheerleader for them. But Office 365 is a decent value proposition, and there is still no real competition for MS Office IMO - so this is pretty much a no brainer.", "label": 1}

This means you have a constant \"whirring\" sound to accompany your learning.  Gets annoying after a while. (2) You can't make archival copies of the originals to work from which means you run the risk of accidentally scratching your original CD (from constantly having to put the CD in and take it out of the drive each time you work the program).  Scratch your original CD and you are out a lot of money!  (3) Even with a fast computer, the program works quite slow due to being forced to work from the CD.  I found myself often waiting for the computer to read information from the CD before I could progress with the lessons.\n\nI'm disappointed with being forced to work from the CD's to make the program function and especially the accidental risk of damaging the CD's and basically losing a costly investment.\n\nSurely in this day and age a prominent company such as Rosetta Stone could come up with a better operation for their software to be used than what they currently have for their customers.", "label": 2}

To cite a few; a very limited autofill and formatting features, very limited ability make buttons, macro scripts, and missing features such as a pop-up calendars and calculator, a workable preview mode, floating help boxes, etc.\nGood points?  Conversion from a MS Word form was flawless, and scanning a form was not half bad.  It's easy to use (it'd better be because the documentation is almost useless), automatic generation of database but it has to be manually exported to DB programs.  A 10,000 record limit to the number of records that can be stored per form is ridiculously low.  You can create \"e-mailable\" forms to send to others to fill even if they don't have the software (but you are limited to 100 such forms unless you buy the premium edition).  There is supposedly a way to post forms on the scansoft website but it hasn't yet worked for me.\nWorse, Scansoft allows only ONE free techsupport event and then you have to pay for each event after.  The so-called support forum has NO INPUT from Scansoft techs.  All the better to force you to pay for tech support.\nUnfortunately, if you need form software that is easy and somewhat mature there aren't alot of competing products out there.

{"text": "I have been mad about the onenote 2003 as most of the people are. The initial days with it were great, a new software with a new look and a new concept. But as the days progressed with it and the honeymoon period was over, I observed certain serious limitations in it- which i think will be developed in the new versions.\n\n1.it is not certainly that intuitive that it seems to be.\n\nIt is seriously handicapped by the lack of  treelike  structure that one finds in treepad software that makes  every page you created appear on the left side of the  screen, in a heirarchial structure. This structure makes it  very easy to navigate through the entire note book in just  a click. where as in the onenote this structure is present in an drop down menu like  thing which is embarassing to use as time goes by (which i would like to give one word - primitive).each time one has to point an arrow on it and click it and the menu drops and click on the + signs to see whats in the folder and u find only sections in it and there are no pages seen in that structure. and you have to know some how, which topics are in which section and in which page and its a great demand on the mind. And when you leave that heirarchial structure it is gone and again you have to repeat the entrie procedure. it gets on the nerves especially when your notes grows and when you have to suddenly view some page in some other section or folder.\n\n2. With this onenote can you guess how many note books you can create? take a wild guess!!!! YOU would be utterly disappointed to know that the answer is 1 only ONE note book can be created with it.  {for comparison and to tell you that there  are better softwares - treepad is excellent in this feature you  can create any number of  notebooks any where on your system  unlike onenote where you have to create the sections only in  the  default folder -in my documents it provides when it is  first  installed and the organization of each note book is  preserved where ever you open that notes,}\n\n3. take this scenario:- you have to reformat your system, or open the notes in some other system. the clumsient part of the picture now surfaces. when you copy and paste a new sections  Onenote opens it through a shortcut but not directly. the heirarchy in the onenote is maintained only for the only one notebook that it creates when it is first installed. when you reformat your system or transfer sections of some other system  those sections are seen as aliens by the Onenote and the only way to navigate through them is through the windows browser. its really awkward.\n\nmany of the features are good to brilliant. But these are mostly superficial features that you can get on without, or find alternatives. But it is some what crippled when the above features are considered which take away the userfriendly tag of Microsoft corporation from this product. especially when there are a few other softwares that have the above features, that are either free or less cheap. you can try treepad business edition if you can afford some bucks. or treepad  lite or keynote softwares these are for free. they don't have some of the fancy things of onenote like note flags... But are much more intuitive and userfriendly.\n\nOnenote is not the ultimate note taking software as it is portraited. It has to travel still further before one can place it there.", "label": 2}

One thing I miss about Quicken is the right panel which keeps tabs of which accounts and other windows that you recently opened, which I used a lot to one-click to my favorite accounts and reports.  Now in Money, it is 2-3 click process of either pulling down the menu to access the favorite accounts/reports, or first clicking on the account/report list icon then clicking on the account/report you want to view.\nAnother more significant thing to consider is the different Financial Institutions that are signed up with Quicken and Money.  As Quicken has been around longer, I believe that there are more places that you can directly download into Quicken.  For example, Citibank: in Quicken you can download directly your account activity, but in Money, you have to go to Citibank's website, log-in, download a QIF file onto your harddrive, then import into Money.  Same deal with PNC Bank - you can download directly into Quicken, but not Money.\nAs you can see from the numerous reviews, neither Money nor Quicken get high ratings, but if you're going to choose between the two, you should definitely visit their websites and see what the status is with the financial institutions that you bank with.\nAs for me, I'm so fed up with Quicken crashing all the time that I'm going to stick with Money for the rest of the year and see how things go.", "label": 2}

Quite annoying, but the real kicker is that the refund never came and Intuit was pretty much unresponsive to my attempts to follow up.\nI will probably continue using Turbo Tax because the product is solid (at least for me...I see others have had issues), and because once you've got your tax information in for one year, the next year and the next year after that you keep reaping benefits.  However, I wish some other company would buy the product from Intuit so I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore.", "label": 2}

For the most part the features are poorly implemented and confusing ... I don't have nearly enough space to list all of its problems but lets just say the only reason I'm using it is because it is the standard word processor for my company. I write large (200+ page) documents on a regular basis and have done so for many years.

{"text": "Before discovering the reality of the warning expressed in the title of this brief - but I believe important - review, I used several different brands and types of print-and-stick-on disk labeling systems. The CD Stomper Pro is among the best of the six or seven I tried. That is to say, the software it comes with is pretty easy to use and creating attractive labels for your CDs and DVDs is pretty easy - as is the basic application of them using the \"stomper\" itself, a plastic device that holds the sticky label in correct position so it can be placed on the disk with minimal effort.\n\nIF you decide, after reading this review, to continue to either use or consider using this type of disk-labeling system, be aware that each manufacturer has it's own proprietary 'blanks' - that is, the sticky backed paper labels, while all round and standard disk diameter, are plotted out idiosyncratically on each companies templates. So, the ones you need to use with CD Stomper are NOT compatible with ANY other labeling system. This can be important as the prices for the blank sheets vary considerably. Also, some companies produce blank sheets (and the necessary software) that include options of printing labels for CD cases and narrow side-of-case title label blanks. Others do not. So - IF you are going to use these things, shop carefully. Not just for price, but for the accompanying software and labeling options each one provides.\n\nThat being said, the MAIN agenda in writing this review is to try to dissuade you from using these sticky labels at all! All of them (there is no one brand exception that I have been able to identify) will throw the balance of the disk off - some by quite a lot. Over time, this will make many of them unreadable on your standard CD and DVD players. Also, the glue itself causes the plastic of the disk to actually decompose. Again, this is not something you would notice right away - but over time, the quality and overall playability of the information, pictures or videos on the disk will become compromised.\n\nSimply put, while the CD Stomper is among the best of what it is - what it is should be avoided.\n\nAlternatives that will NOT damage your disks - either today or into the future, include 1) simply water-based markers, or - for those of you who, like myself, prefer a more professional looking identification of your disk, investing in either an ink jet or thermal printer might be worth your while. (I have a review posted of mine, The Signature Z1 by Primera - a thermal printer that I have been entirely satisfied with.) Additionally, some computers now come with drives and the necessary software to use a system patented as \"LightScribe\" which allows you to print directly onto the disk while it is still in your computer's drive.\n\nIn any event - eschew these stick-on labeling systems. You have worked too hard to produce your disks and don't want them ruined by sticking extra weight and chemicals on them.", "label": 0}

These guys should buy a clue. I don't have 6 months to try to figure out how this software is supposed to work. Why don't they test it for user experience???\nThe bad experiences never stop with this piece of junk: you install it, it doesn't give you a choice as to where to install it to (which drive) - a big no no!\n I installed the NeroMedia - horrible! Didn't work - didn't play or open a single CD. So, I uninstall it using the uninstall from the Nero installation CD, only it does not uninstall completely, and now everytime I click on the CDRW, it keeps looking for NeroMedia.\nIf you insert a blank CDR or CDRW, regardless of manufacturer, it freezes your computer so bad you have to unplug the power supply! So, I uncheck the autostart, which gets rid of the freezes, but now you have to manually start the \"run\" every time you install any software from the drive, which is a pain - I never had to uncheck the autostart to prevent my Adaptec CD burning software from freezing my computer with a blank medium!\nThe InCD part of the Nero software does not work proprely either - it is supposed to alert you to when the CDRW disc has been formatted... does no such thing - so you have to wait up to 40 minutes, before checking manually, because if you do it sooner you might interrupt the possibly ongoing process, and have to start over again! Hopeless!\nThe \"Help\" section is useless. Try to find a section that tells you such a basic thing as how to burn a DATA CDR - there is actually no entry for data CD burning - check it out. You have to go through the whole stupid interface and sort of blindly figure it out on your own through trial and error... which brings me to the user interface...\nUser interface - OK, this has just got to be the single worst feature of this piece of junk software. Nothing makes sense, and none of the choices are obvious. The dialogue boxes are hopeless. Compare it to the clarity of the Adaptec software - as a complete novice, with the Adaptec you can go and burn CDs because the process is logical and intuitive, takes you from one part of the process to the next logically - with Nero, you'll spend your days trying to figure out the simplest things!\nA really horrible feature of this junkware, is the utter lack of choices and the hidden process by which it does things without giving you a say. It will not let you decide where you want to store an image - I happen to have my drive partitioned and since it stupidly installed itself on C without giving me a choice, I have a problem, in that my C is rather small and not sufficient in space to hold a full audio CD image. But I have plenty of space on D. Well, there is no way to tell Nero to go to a specific folder on D! Idiocy. And so on with all of the processes. With Adaptec, I can choose everything - I love it. Nero is a piece of junk.\nI will uninstall it and junk it as soon as possible, and going back to Adaptec. My only fear is that just as with the NeroMedia part of it, these guys will leave a mess on my computer instead of uninstalling completely.\nDO NOT BUY NERO - avoid it at all costs.

{"text": "This is a further comment to the review below, since I can't respond directly to the posting above which describes a fix for Windows XP installation;\n\nI appreciate that Mr. Norris is trying to be helpful, and his **fix** will work as described, however, it is an extremely bad idea for most people to make edits in the registry, and should not be encouraged as a fix to get around false advertising and a game that should not be sold in its current form. Any mistakes, even a slip of the finger while making the edits, can result in catastrophy (machine may not reboot next time), so it should only be done with extreme care, and by someone who knows what they're doing. My assumption is that most readers of these posts (and, if fact, most purchasers of game software for children) do not fit that category, or do not want to take that risk.\n\nDo not reward companies that sell things to a general market that are unfit for use, and unsupported by the vendor. Do not buy this product, period.\n\noriginal comments follow:\n\nThis game is not compatible with Windows XP unless your children are allowed Administrator accounts on your PC.  The reason for this is that the game was written for Windows 98, and has not been updated since, despite the indications on the box that it works with XP.\n\nUnfortunately, my son was in tears after spending his allowance to buy this game at the school book fair because in our house, kids do not get administrator accounts.  When I called Scholastic to request support, their only workaround is to run the game as an administrator. They admit it was designed for Win98, and that they haven't updated it because they \"haven't had enough complaints from customers to write a version for XP\".  All this despite the labelling which claims it is XP compatible.  You must run as an administrator because the game needs to update the registry (this is an extraordinarily bad program design decision for a children's game) every time it is run.\n\nI am perplexed at the numerous positive reviews of the game here.  Either all of these reviewers are running obsolete versions of the operating system, or their kids are given administrator accounts on XP, which is dangerous and foolish.  Scholastic will not refund your money once the box is open, even though the claim of XP compatibility is false advertising, at Scholastic tech support's own admission.  My recommendation is that no one should buy this game unless they are still running Win98.  No company should be rewarded for relabelling obsolete software and continuing to sell it as if it was current.", "label": 0}

Well, I sat down with my son to play the game and thought it was over his head. To solve the first puzzle, your child would have to go back through one screen to find a key, then to another screen to unlock a shed, then search the shed for the object and finally return to the original screen to use the object. Don't get me wrong - I think it's a great idea to get kids looking for the less obvious answers, but this game is just not for 3 to 4 year olds (the age range the magazine recomended it for).

{"text": "My situation: Both my 8 y.o. son and I are learning Japanese together.  I have taken one year of Japanese in college, my husband speaks some, and we have access to native speakers.  That said, mostly I am a beginner needing a simple, clear, and accurate text that we can use for self-study.\n\nWe are using the i-pod touch application of Human Japanese (which is very handy to carry around in your pocket and use to practice pronunciation and what-not where ever you happen to be.)\n\nReasons this software stands out:\n\n  -I LOVE that I can instantly hear the pronunciation of any Japanese words or sentences simply by touching them.  Japanese writing is introduced immediately, so this is very helpful in building your reading skills and  pronunciation at the same time, which is the only effective way to do it.  This is a HUGE improvement over my college text books, where one has to pop in separate audio C.D.'s to hear the lesson's vocabulary.  With Human Japanese you see it and hear it together all at the same time, and it's easy to access.\n\n  -I love that the hiragana and katakana are animated, so you can see how it is drawn simply by touching it.\n\n  - The explanations and layout are easy and enjoyable to read.  My son enjoys reading the lessons to me in the car, and is not intimidated or confused by it.\nIt's clear this is someone who knows from experience what would be useful to an English speaker learning Japanese (and is no doubt creating the text he WISHED he had when learning.)\n\nMy son and I have been taking a very leisurely pace and are on chapter 10 after about 5 months.  This is mostly due to wanting to get the kana down solidly, and having the limitations of an 8 y.o. attention span.  We aren't doing tons of talking yet, but the delay is worth having a comfortable reading relationship with the kana.  I have skimmed ahead and the other chapters seem well done.\n\nI do find it helpful to do some supplementing:\n\n We could not remember all the hiragana and katakana characters so easily, so we made our own charts, and would quiz ourselves by drawing the characters in the air, until we could do them from memory.  I highly suggest printing out two blank 10 by 5 box grids (plus one drawn in for \"n\") and making a hiragana and katakana chart for yourself.  You can easily print out a chart from the web for reference, but making your own really helps the memory.  We have used practice print outs from a Japanese website for kids, that are fabulous, with cute pictures for the characters that teach you simple words at the same time.  They have corresponding Hiragana and Katakana charts.  The site is kids dot nifty dot com fowardslash study forwardslash index dot htm\nThe chart with the yellow background is the hiragana, the mint-green is the katakana, and the pictures with the pink ice cream and candy are the worksheets.\n\nThis, however, is only to supplement: Human Japanese will teach you what need to know about the characters...this just gives extra practice to those who need to write it themselves, and see it all in a chart in one spot.\n\nFor the numbers chapter I found myself wanting to know what the Kanji for the numbers are, and looking that up on the web.  I wish it had been included in the lesson, even if we weren't technically covering Kanji yet.  Same thing for the days of the week.  I found helpful info. fairly easily online for this [...], and also a more useful way of understanding the number units \"man\" (10,000) and \"oku\" (100,000,000) by showing them grouped by 4 places instead of three (shift that comma over so you get 1,0000 and 1,0000,0000.)  This is a small thing, but very useful for understanding what is going on with the numbers, and I'm surprised it wasn't presented that way.\n\nDespite me wanting to supplement here and there, this is a great program to use as the backbone of your beginning study.\nUltimately, this software is a very pleasant and solid way to start...and is preferable to programs faaar more expensive.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Among the all-in-one MP3 ripper/encoder/jukebox products out there, MusicMatch is definitely the best, imho.  BUT, the extra features you get from the non-free, registered version is only a slight improvement. I really do like the program and did buy a lifetime upgrade for the deluxe version.  And if you do buy it, download it from their website and buy the upgrade key...it's a few bucks cheaper.\nThe only thing is, I don't use this application any more.  There are lots of opinions on the best way to encode an MP3 and the one I agree with most, is the combination of the Exact Audio Copy ripper and the LAME encoder.  General opinion on the Internet says that EAC is the best(most accurate CD ripper) available.  PLUS, the LAME encoder, which is open source software, is considered to be the superior encoding engine.  The only other codec worth a crap, is from the original creator of the MP3 compression scheme, Fraunhofer.  That encoder is what is used in MusicMatch and Nero.  The problem with those implementations is that it cuts off at 16kHz.  Not the greatest for archiving, but if you don't care about getting the best sound quality, it's okay.  For most people, it's hard to hear the difference between an MP3 encoded with MusicMatch and LAME (or any other encoder for that matter).  What MusicMatch is definitely good at is doing it all, fairly easily.  Encoding a CBR rip of my CD's is definitely faster with MM6.1 than the EAC/LAME combo.\nIn the end, I still care about getting the BEST sound quality out of my MP3's and so I will stick with EAC and LAME(besides, they're free).  I even paid for MM, but still choose not to use it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is my fifth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my third year using the state tax version. I don't like the product activation (who does) but I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.\nI'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. Still, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. You can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.\nI tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out.

{"text": "As far as features, I agree with much of what's been covered in the other reviews.  There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: \"it's probably due to spyware\".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!\nSo, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.

The Mapsource TOPO maps have some sort of background shading.  Perhaps this is color detail (e.g. green means vegitation).  The problem is that on the screen it is just dark grey.  With this dark gray background on your Etrex screen, you can barely, if at all, see any other map features, your route, waypoints or tracks.\nTherefore, loading the Mapsource TOPO map on the Etrex practically renders the Map screen on the Etrex useless in the back country.

{"text": "So, I'm a really visual learner.  Therefore Rosetta Stone (visual-based) should be much easier to use and learn with than Pimsleur (audio-based), right?? We are going to France and I wanted to learn French before the trip.  I bought this produce as well as a new copy of Pimsleur French Unlimited level 1.\n\nRosetta Stone:\n1. Easy to install\n2. Lots of different \"types\" of lessons (reading, writing, speaking, grammar,etc.)\n3. The ability to see the words and memorize the visuals.\nBUT also\n4. I hate the little \"correct!\" sound that it uses.  You can't turn it off.  It's terribly annoying.\n5. My pronunciation is not very good because I can see the word and keep trying to pronounce it like it is spelled.\n6. When I speak into the microphone, the program hates my effort and keeps failing me\n7. All worked well until I hit Lesson #4.  At that point, the pictures because vague and I wasn't quite sure what I was saying or why.  I started worrying about verbs and rather than understanding grammar, just started memorizing things without understanding.\n8. Oh my, the \"correct!\" sound became an aversion stimulus by this time.\n\nPimsleur:\n1. Easy to install\n2. Two types of lessons (listening and reading)\n3. Because I'm not a good Audio-learner, I had to redo the lessons, sometimes 5 or 6 times\nBUT also\n4. My pronunciation got a LOT better because I was listening to the speakers and not looking at the words\n5. I picked up enough of the grammar to understand what I was saying and recombine words and phrases rather than just mimicking them\n6. This program doesn't attempt to \"reward\" you with that awful dinging sound\n\nBottom line?  I made it through Pimsleur French 1 (30 lessons) and am buying French 2.  I have found it much easier to use (DESPITE being a visual learner).  I quit at lesson #4 in Rosetta Stone.  I do not want to go back to Rosetta Stone unless they can:\n\n1. Speed up the testing process.  (A more rapid click and on to the next question)\n2. Eliminate the sound they use to indicate a correct response.\n\nI'd recommend at least trying Pimsleur first - even if you are a visual learner.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Before I start my review I want to say two things.  First off, I only give 5 star reviews to things that change my life.  Second, although I was raised Catholic, I am more interested in Christianity from the academic point of view.\n\nGlo is by far the most amazing Christian tool I have ever used.  The artwork, maps, videos, etc that are linked to biblical scriptures brings the bible to life like nothing I have ever seen.  Bible study groups will love the topical sections which is an encyclopedia of relevant scriptures.  Students will love how easy it is to navigate and learn from the bible.  Anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity will find Glo to be a valuable tool.  I truly wish this was out during my Catholic School days.\n\nDespite having a 5 start review, there are some things I would love to see added.  A timeline that followed Christianity through the present time.  A Christian Denomination option for an upgrade, or an add on (as an academic I would love to have links to different writings and additional texts of various denominations).  Inclusion of scriptures that did not make the NIV Bible.\n\nOverall I feel that by using the Glo software, you will see Christianity in a whole new light.  Every person that I have shown this program to has gone out and bought it.  That says something about the quality of this product.\n\n(FYI I have a Mac and it worked with out any problems)", "label": 1}

I am very familiar with Life Application Bibles and this time I was purchasing one for a friend, because she had fell in love with several of mine that I carry along with me and/or leave at home.  She was very pleased with the cover and color of the Bible. She was interested in knowing where I get my biblical material from and I shared my experiences of ordering from Amazon.com with her. After hearing about Amazon.com, she was very delighted with the timing of delivery and receipt and wanted me to order her the same Bible so she could see for herself; and I did.\n\nNow, to the one who may be researching a new style of reading that truly helps you to understand what the text is saying...Please allow me to suggest the \"Life Application Study Bible\".

Yes Red Hat is no longer supporting it's desktop version (9.0 support ends 4/2004), and yes after I heard this, I wanted to try another distribution, but for easy installation and a number of developer applications (Kdeveloper, QT, Apache Server, etc.), Red Hat could not be beaten.  Also because RH is one of the most widely used Linux distros out, you can go to almost any major bookstore and find books for all types of users (newbie to advanced).  In fact, I will probably upgrade to the Fedora 1.0/RH 10.0 after I learn more about RH 9.0. In addition, of the three distros I tried to install (RH 9.0, Mandrake 9.1, and Suse 9.0), RH installed the way I wanted to the first time, with minimal configuration.

My purpose for using this software is primarily to create slide shows of JPEG images that are self-running on CD-Rom.  Creating music CDs is secondary to me at this point.  Before I purchased the software, I read a good number of the reviews posted here, so I was forewarned.\nWell, the other reviewers weren't lying.  I had a lot of difficulty trying to get my images burned on a CD and then to create a slide show with Photo Relay.  My PC crashed 3 times in the process. There were not any step-by-step instructions on how create the photo album and slide show in the documentation.  I was referred to the Roxio website - which kept freezing up on me. There also did not seem to be a way to specify that I wanted to create the album/slide show on the CD rather than on one of my hard drives.\nIn the end, I was able to jury-rig a way to do what I wanted by using DirectCD (included in the software). Once I treated my CD burner as another drive, I was able to transfer the files and create the album/slide show.\nI tested the resulting CD on my office computer to see if the slide show would run on its own and it worked fine.\nI am now trying to figure out how to do this the \"correct\" way using PhotoRelay without Direct CD.\nSince this is the only software I have been able to find that allows me to create the kind of slide shows I want, it looks like I am stuck with it.\nGood luck future buyers!", "label": 2}

{"text": "Like the other reviewers, I find the program entertaining and far more enjoyable to use than your ordinary language study CD or books.  However, after nearly completing the entire program, I find that I have not learned a lot of important vocabulary or how to really conjugate verbs.  My biggest complaint with the program is its inclusion of esoteric vocabulary.  For example, one of the sentences you learn is \"The boy can speak because he is not underwater.\"  True, you are learning \"can speak\" but that's really not something that's going to come in that handy.  Other examples of strange vocabulary that gets too much attention:  lieing down, bending forward, drying your hair, zippering close a jacket, tieing shoelaces.  I'm very surprised at the kinds of vocabulary they have chosen to include.\n\nOn the plus side, one is much more likely to use this program every day than open a book or listen to CDs.  So you will learn more just by virtue of hearing Italian every day.  The repetition is good and after not too long when you get to Level 2, you will probably be amazed at how well you can understand complicated directions like \"go three blocks past the school, turn right\" etc.\n\nI find that only use a few of the different types of exercises -- for example, I don't use the part that has you type in response to dictation-- but it's good that they have a bunch of options for you to choose from.  The most useful, I think, is listening to the phrase and choosing the photo that is described.  The least useful exercise mode is seeing the photo and then hearing four phrases before picking the correct one.\n\nIf you expect to be introduced to verb tenses as they are in a text book, then you'll be disappointed. You learn third person forms first and later they introduce first person.\n\nIn conjunction with some other language study, this is a useful program.  Don't expect to be speaking fluently after level 2. My guess is that even Level 1 and Level 2 together would not get you as far as one year of a good college course.\n\nOne more note:  Level two has some good vocabulary lessons at the end of the unit. You can use these lessons as you are doing Level one because they are just vocabulary quizes.  (Nouns are grouped by subject: food, clothes, etc.)  Level two also has a bunch of \"humorous sketches\" where the captions to cartoons are given and you are supposed to be able to figure out what the captions mean.  There isn't enough preparation for this to seem doable at first, but probably after I study with another method and come back to it, it will seem less difficult.  If it weren't for the vocabulary lessons in Level two, I would say that Level two is not really that helpful.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This program and the other Earobics titles are clearly designed for North American users.\n\nThis is a shame because most of the activities work quite well.\n\nWhat is more problematic is the English vs American accents.\n\nSome of the differences are very frustrating for the kids, and leaves them stranded on the same level, unable to progress.\n\n(This review is of Earobics Step 2 - but also applies to the other Earobics titles.)\n\nIn the Fireman sounds game - the short vowels u and o sound almost identical.\n\nFor English speakers (UK, Australia, NZ, Sth Africa etc) these sounds are very different.\nwith the short 'u' sound clearly being pronounced 'uh' as in 'cup' or 'but'\nand the short 'o' sound pronounced as 'o' as in 'cot' or 'orange'\n\nHowever the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.\nSo instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.\nHowever in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.\n\nSimilarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.\neg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min\nchicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in\nkitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin\n\nFinally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.\n\nSummary:\nThe Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.\n\nThe beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.\n\nApart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.\n\nProbably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.\n\n***\nThe games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I decided I wanted to try designing my own web site but I'm not really a computer person.  To test the water before I dove into it financially, I got the HOT Macromedia Dreamweaver MX book to learn what I could about it.  Although I have yet to actually put a page on the web, I felt confident enough after using the trial CD to buy the program.  I've been having a lot of fun with it, and look forward to starting the site.  As I noted in my review of the Green and Rudner book, however, there is a significant caveat to the situation.  Eventually one has to have files of ones own with which to complete ones actual site, and that will involve one in learning other programs like Adobe Photoshop, Flash, or similar work.  Furthermore, although the Dreamweaver takes the problem of computer languages off ones shoulders, these programs require even more artistic talent, patience and diligence than the Dreamweaver program does. For me, that fact suggests more fun things to learn, but for others it may be a major pain and just one more barrier to accomplishing their goals.  If you find yourself in the latter group, I'd find a professional web page designer to deal with the problem. If you're like me and enjoy learning new things, then this is the program for you.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Dantz Retrospect 6.0 is an industrial grade product.  From what I can tell it's nicely implemented when it comes to supporting backups in a \"heavy\" environment.\nFor my use on my G4 Mac (dual 825 Mhz processors w/1 GByte of ram) I find it pretty hard to use.\nFor example, to backup files from a single directory, you have to choose the \"Source\" but that only let's you choose a source disk or create a \"Volume\" that only seems to be able to contain a whole disk.  There's no option to directly specify a directory as the backup \"Source\".  There's no screen specific help button on the screens where these terms are mentioned.\nTo backup an individual directory, it looks like you have to specify a \"Selecting\" option separate from the \"Source\" option where the \"Selecting\" option let's you specify substring to match against filenames/directoris when looking at the \"Source\".  Again there's no screen specific help button in the \"Selecting\" screen.\nI'm trying to backup the files in a singe directory right now, but Retrospect seems to be scanning all files and folders on my Mac.  I'm actually writing this review while waiting for Dantz to scan my whole hard drive.\nThis seems brain damaged.  I suspect I'm doing something wrong.  So I'll go read the manual and figure it out, but that's exactly the problem.  You have to read the manual to use this product.\nI'm also curious about why Retrospect has to scan each file on the whole hard disk *before* starting the backup.

{"text": "Some people learn more by watching than by reading. I know that I first learned about how to use Lightroom in videos by the redoubtable Michael Reichmann and Jeff Schewe, but that was mostly because they were the first out with instructional material. Mostly those videos were images of talking heads with an occasional screen shot. \"Learn Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 by Video\" is an offering by two other great image processing authors, Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland.\n\nThe approach taken is fairly standard. After an introduction the videos go chapter by chapter through each of the Lightroom modules, and an examination of most of the buttons and sliders that, because of its easy interface, has made Lightroom popular with so many photographers.  Each section shows a screen shot where the viewer can follow the moves made by the authors to apply Lightroom functions, accompanied by the voice-over of one of the two authors. The chapters cover everything from bringing images into Lightroom to outputting them to web sites or slideshows. The level of instruction is fairly simple, but if you've never used the software, the instruction will get the average person processing pictures after several hours of watching. More experienced users won't learn anything new, but they are not the audience. Not every function is covered in all aspects, like my favorite test, whether the discussion of keywords covers the importation of a keyword list from another source into Lightroom. On the other hand, although this isn't covered, it clearly a subject for a more advanced user.\n\nAt the end of each chapter there is an examination. Unfortunately, if you get an answer wrong, you won't be told the correct answer, so you'll have to watch the lesson again. Maybe that's not unfortunate.\n\nThe video comes with a booklet where Aaland first presents some ideas about composition (perhaps added because the video, like most Lightroom books, doesn't tell you when a slider or button is appropriate; for that, I'd recommend \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vision-Voice-Refining-Your-Vision-in-Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321670094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vision & Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (Voices That Matter)</a>\" by David duChemin). That's followed by a chapter about what's new in Lightroom 3. The disk also contains images that can be imported into Lightroom by the viewer to follow the same procedures as the authors in the lessons. I'd like to say that this allows one to follow along with the authors, but it was here that video presentation encountered a stumbling block. With a book you could keep the book in front of the computer and, if images were provided, the reader could follow along. To duplicate the experience there is a button in the lower right hand corner of the video screen, called \"Watch-and-Work\". If you click this, the video is reduced to about one-fourth of the screen. Unfortunately, when I tried to follow along with the video, the video image was often in the way and had to be moved around to gain access to the Lightroom sliders. Eventually I figured out that it was easier to pause the video and minimize the video screen and work in Lightroom. This doesn't take a computer guru to figure out, but given that the videos are aimed at tyros, it might have been useful to provide more detailed instructions in how to use the videos. Unfortunately there is just a very brief help screen, that, to make matters worse, refers to processing the picture in Dreamweaver! It might also have been useful to suggest to users that as soon as possible, they should import the images provided on the disk into Lightroom, as well as other instructions on how to best use the videos to learn.\n\nI'm still a person who prefers books, being a geezer who didn't grow up with YouTube. I underline important ideas or read them twice, and even read them on a bus, without opening a laptop. To be fair, the video does allow for bookmarking (again undocumented), that accomplishes many of these functions and perhaps reading on the bus may not be the best way to learn about running a piece of software like Lightroom.\n\nI'm impressed by the video technology, and even though there are a few bumpy spots, as an introduction to Lightroom, this will certainly teach the new user how to use the software.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The Crime: C\n\nNancy is invited to Blackmoor Manor in merry old England to check on the new wife of a British diplomat. The woman has apparently become sick shortly after her new marriage. Rumors abound that the Beast of Blackmoor is creeping around, along with a family witch.\n\nSuspects include Linda's stepdaughter Jane Penvellyn, scholar Nigel Mookerjee, batty old Mrs. Drake, and Jane's tutor Ethel Bosinny.\n\nThe villain and the Penvellyn treasure were both RIDICULOUS. All that threatening atmosphere and chilling spookiness wasted on such silly things.\n\nPuzzles: C\n\nArgh! Just aargh! So many of them! And so tedious they were! The premise is that the Penvellyn family has a long and illustrious history of being geniuses of one kind or another. Each member of the family studied a certain subject, such as computers or astronomy. And they all left clues for future generations to a great hidden treasure (there it is again). The clues are all crazily scattered all over the manor, hidden in Latin crests and books and alchemical symbols.\n\nYou also have to talk to an 80-year-old parrot to solve one puzzle. The family trusted a huge and important secret partly to a parrot that could keel over at any moment. (Yes, they live a long time, but not every parrot lives so long.)\n\nOther silly details include a revolving room and a strange map that somehow tracks your progress through an area, even though GPS wasn't invented way back when.\n\nThey could have left out the anacronistic map, sure, but then we would have been in serious trouble. The gamers needed all the help they could get in this game. The puzles just kept going and going. The game was long and involved.\n\nGameplay: C\n\nNancy is supposedly in England and we aren't allowed to see a single bit of the English countryside. Why? Because Mrs. Drake doesn't want us tracking mud through the house. If I came a thousand miles to another country, nobody would stop me from taking a look outside! This game didn't even have to be set in England. It could have taken place in Salem, Mass. just as easily. (Of course, the Penvellyn family wouldn't have been as old then.)\n\nI couldn't trigger some events in the game no matter how carefully I played or what walkthrough I followed. I ended up downloading saved games from other people to get past these parts of the game. It lessened the quality of the gameplay for me, to say the least.\n\nOne thing I loved were Jane's mini-games. Sometimes I open the game just to play Skull and Bones.\n\nTime Changes: The alarm clock is back. Argh!\n\nVoice Acting: B\n\nJane is a cute, cultured little English girl. Ethel got on my nerves, appearing out of nowhere and looking down her nose at me. Linda irritated me, her voice and character. I mean, I realize you're depressed, but I flew a thousand miles to help you, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just answer my questions instead of clamming up, okay, lady?\n\nThe cockney rhyming slang was extra cool, though.\n\nMusic: A\n\nVery restrained and classical. Chilling and spooky when it needed to be.\n\nIGraphics/Video: A\n\nJane in particular was weirdly animated. All joints and long legs. I think she was too thin.\n\nOther than that, the graphics were the best yet. Bonus points for the smooth animated sequences in between player-controlled action.\n\nTechnical: C\n\nAlong with the problem I had triggering events, I had another glitch in the game. When ordering food from the restaurant, it would appear on a silver platter in my room. But, after that, I could never get other food to be delivered, no matter how long I waited or how many times I asked for it. Every time I lifted the lid, it would always be the first thing I had ordered.\n\nOverall, it was a good game, but it's definitely not my favorite.", "label": 2}

With that, you don't have to remember which computer has which document. If you are working on something large, like a book, you can work on it at whichever computer is available.

Keep server version, or Keep My version\". Apparently one of those didn't get my changes. Just yesterday I saved a document which appeared to both save and upload correctly. Then this morning I was faced with the dreaded question. As both saving locally appeared to work, as well as uploading, shouldn't they both have my changes? I chose \"Keep my version\", since saving locally seemed more likely to have succeeded. Wrong! All my changes were gone. Ironically, they really had been uploaded, as I could find the changes in the previous version on the onedrive website.\n\nWriting something like a book this sort of issue can be dramatically more painful. What if the last time you touched it (a week ago) you made important but key updates in a few places, but you don't recall what they were anymore?

It offers fantastic interaction between allies and manages to convey some of the complexity of strategic decision-making without bogging the player down in details like logistics or politics.\n  This software, however, is one of the worst-written things I have ever seen. It even plays like it's not object-oriented, the same parameters being controlled in different ways on different screens. It is full of bugs that are resolved by none of the available patches. In the Iron Blitz version, for example, if you  are the defender in a naval battle and your only unit is a destroyer, the enemy's submarine hit will freeze the game because it does not check to see if there are units left to receive normal hits.

{"text": "My wife and I are both college graduates and enjoyed playing the later games in the Nancy Drew Series (Mansion and Final Scene) very much, however this game fell real short of our expectations. For starters the interface is clumsy and does not allow the player to see or interact with critical items unless they are approached from a certain angle. Often the player will find him or herself relying more on repetitive clicking of certain areas, than using the deductive reasoning involved in solving the later games in the series.  At times, the game seems more like a \"whereisit?\" than a \"whodunnit?\".\nThe game is too linear at times, in that you must do certain things that do not seem crucial to the plot in order to proceed to other events, yet at times the game lets you proceed onto other events unprepared, setting the player up for great dissapointment (tip: do not save the game in the \"bomb scene\" unless you have found the wirecutters).\nPerhaps the most dissapointing thing about the game, when compared to the later games in the series, is the lack of realism in both the dialouge and puzzles in the game. There are too many times when the game should include the opportunity to question suspects to get a better grasp on their personalities and does not.  This is not a problem in the later games which usually include thoughtful conversations with the suspects.\nMany of the puzzles also make you feel like you are jumping through the programmers' \"hoops\" instead of relying on logic. The final puzzle is particularly worthy of note in this case, as you are given a timed puzzle which can only be solved by trial and error.  At times in the game, you are given seemingly solvable puzzles that do not have impact on the progession of the game (such as word jumbles that state obvious things).  At other times you are misled to believe that you can find important clues by performing certain actions, which lead nowhere.  Realistic solutions to puzzles are also sparse in this game.  For example, at one point, you are required to cut some wires (in a hurry), but are not allowed to pick up a scalpel that is right in front of you.\nOn a more positive note, the game does have and excellent story line and sometime seemed as though it would redeem itself, but each time it began to flow nicely gameplay was hindered by another problem.  In sum, stay away from stay tuned for danger and start with the later games in the series if you want to try a Nancy Drew adventure.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've just completed reading the reviews on various home design software deciding which one to purchase. While they all seem to leave something to be desired (not to mention their confusing names and software lineage), you can make a variety of roof types with this software. I have the demo for \"3D Home Architect\" Home Design Deluxe 6 by Broderbund as it says in the About dialog. I assume this is the software included in the suite.\n\nToday I made a standard gable roof using the default 20 or 45 degrees, a standard hip roof, a low angle ranch style gable roof of 15 degrees, a \"shed\" style gable roof with two pitches 15 and 20 degrees on each side, one of 15 and 5 degrees. I tried to make a flat roof, but either I missed something or you need to make a gable roof of zero degrees, but it would not accept anything below 5 degrees.\n\nThe slope can be specified in 1 in N style, N in 12 or percent instead of degrees.\n\nThe roof tools are a bit counter-intuitive and obscure. It took me a while to figure out how to use them. Although the Wizard is limited to a choice of 20 or 45 degree pitches, if you look at the roof properties, you can specify ANY ANGLE once a roof is constructed. Also, in the roof list there are only 20 and 45 degree pitches listed standard for Hip roofs. But you can change these to any angle.\n\nOne of the difficult things to notice and get your head around is that these tiny blue squares on the roof selection marquee are how you affect changes to just one section of the automatically generated roof. So to create a gable roof, you need to first create a Hip roof, then select the roof, select the blue square for the end you want a gable, then click Properties, then change the roof type for that section to gable. I know, it is weird, having to change the roof type for just a section when \"gable\" usually refers to the whole roof.\n\nIf you don't select the blue square you will change the whole roof and just get frustrated.\n\nMaking a curved roof is also strange. It creates one with Hip style ends. You must select and convert the ends to Gable, oddly enough to create an arched roof with \"gable\" ends where the siding is exposed beneath the curve. You have to get used to working with each end of a roof individually. The end result is unfortunately a kind of \"barn\" style roof that is not really curved. By increasing the radius on sections, I was able to get a smoother curve without flat spots. If you think about it, the radius of a curved roof is wider at the base than the building, so the default radius is not enough. By fiddling with the roof data I was able to make a downward curved oriental gable roof. I still was not able to make a satisfactory curved roof or for it to display truss framing for it. I may try adjusting a double slope.\n\nIt always crashes when I try to TrueView render the scene, from the diagnostics it apparently is my ATI drivers or more probably the OpenGL drivers. Crashes have been rare otherwise.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This review is primarily about the software, not the content. I have updated the software to whatever was available as of this writing (3/29/2010). The software seems more like a beta version than a production-ready version. I've been kicked out a few times and it otherwise locks up periodically. I am running off the DVDs; I have not copied any of the disks to my hard drive. Consequently, moving from page to page is slow. Trying to back up to refer to a map or recall a fact is not something you want to do. Lock ups occur when trying to quickly scoot past several pages.\n\nEven if paging were fast, there are other problems. I expect there to be a class action lawsuit against NG owing to the mass outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome that is inevitable.  The text is unreadably small as presented, so I double-click twice ON EACH AND EVERY 2-PAGE sheet to magnify the text so I can read it. Then I must click and drag each page 2 or 3 times to move from top to bottom, and then a few more times to move to the top of the next column; the mouse scroll wheel is not active. A few book marks have thrown me to the magazine cover rather than to the desired page. As I progress through an issue, I have to create a new book mark at each stopping point as there is no quick way to reset an existing book mark.\n\nIf you are accustomed to an eReader like Kindle, the whole interface will seem like two steps backward. If this software is your first foray into reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer, then you will think that a computer is not suitable for reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer. For reference reading, the absence of any way to copy text from the page, or add notes to the text, makes this a poor reference tool.\n\nMy lone comment on the content stems from my attempt to begin reading from the very first issue. Basically, it seems that you'd better be a geologist or physiographer (term from text) to enjoy the early issues as even the first issue is thick with geo-jargon.

I used to get an error that indicated that the program was not working properly every time I ran my computer.  2005 only does that on occasion.  The 3 stars I gave this program take into account that I haven't had any better luck with McAfee or Panda and when this is working (which is most of the time now) it seems to do its job very well.  One feature I really like is banner blocking--it just removes those annoying flashing banners that you see on most sites (ex. \"You're the 1,000,000th visitor and you won a free DVD player! CLICK HERE!\").  So far this has worked perfectly for me.  I also like the firewall better than any other software firewall I have ever used.  Parental controls, on the other hand, are fairly useless--the program seems to crash more often when I have them turned on and yet many objectionable sites are not blocked). Another con is that there is a documented conflict with \"Creative Media Source GO!\"; if you have both load on start up, Internet Security will not function (if you let IS load first and then manually start Media Source, however, it is OK).\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend this product if you can get it for \"Free after rebates\"--a deal that comes up fairly often, if you are looking for it (you will still pay taxes and any postage, depending on your state).

{"text": "I downloaded the \"free\" VP trial version, based on glowing product descriptions, hoping to find an inexpensive practical solution for a particular kind of work.  What I found was that the program was priced at $300 for a single-seat license and will not do the kind of drawing it was promoted for. And its general design is quite poor, often awkward and unwieldy.  It probably will do some things reasonably well, but I think it is too limited and rigid for general use.\n\nWorse, the entire marketing scheme is dishonest.  First off, they claim a five-star review rating on Amazon, ignoring the several one- and two-star ratings.  And it is grossly overpriced.  They offer a $100 discount if you purchase by a short deadline.  That \"deadline\" is regularly shoved out just a few days ahead to apparently stampede a purchase.  The $100 \"discount\" brings the price down to about the regular price on Amazon, so the whole \"discount\" offer is a sham.  The obviously shilled five-star reviews here are another example of dishonest self-promotion.\n\nThere is a basic principle in online purchasing (actually applicable to many aspects of life):  Never buy anything from anyone who lies to get your attention.\n\nNotwithstanding all that, the program might be useful for some people for a limited kind of work.  For those narrow purposes even I might be induced to pay $30 or $40 for it.  Amazon sells previous versions for not much more than that. Some of those might be worth the price for some users, and on that basis I'll give it two stars.", "label": 0}

Sindy Felin's harsh and inaccurate review of Hollywood Screenwriter.\n\nAlso, I am rating our product at 3 stars because I do not think it would be proper for me to rate it in a way that would affect the average rating.\n\nFirst time I noticed a problem was when I tried to email my script to a friend for comments - you can't. Unless the other person has Hollywood Screenwriter, they won't be able to open it. The program doesn't even allow you to cut your text into a Word document (or any other application for that matter.)\n\nANSWER\n\nYou can copy or paste into other programs now and you could always save as an RTF file. Which would allow you to share your script.\n\n Secondly, the top and bottom margins were set at 1.5 inches so for several weeks I thought my script was much longer than it actually was. The margins are easily corrected, but still, 1 inch is proper industry format - they should know that.\n\nANSWER\n\nThis has been corrected in all of the available formats.\n\nThird, the spacing between scene headings is incorrect. Proper industry format says three spaces, this program gives you two. I had to go in and hit a hard return at the beginning of every scene heading in a hundred page script - very annoying.\n\nANSWER\n\nActually the program has always given you several different formats of screenplay to use, including one that gives you triple spaces.\n\n Fourth, you can not incorporate a (beat) into the dialogue. As soon as you type a parantheses, the program thinks its acting instructions and formats whatever is in the () accordingly. On the online FAQ they recognize this problem and say to use [] or {} for beats!!! That's great, try to break into the business by having your script look different than other professional scripts. I don't think so. I makes me wonder what other formatting stlyle is incorrect.\n\nANSWER\n\nBy Holding the Control Key while typing the Parenthesis it will place it in your dialogue.\n\nFinally, and this is a doozy, at any point you can go and try to open a script you've been working on forever and find that it isn't there. The program gives an Error 32, whatever that means, and opens up what it calls your script but is actually one blank page. The company's online help has an update you can download to fix this problem and after the download, you'll supposedly be able to recover your script. Didn't work for me. I opened an older version I had and then re-did my work to the best of my memory. Now, this morning, I popped the CD in and...nothing. The program won't open at all.\n\nThe Error 32 is absolutely fixed in the current version that is shipping, so this should not be a problem. If it did not work for this user, than more than likely the update was not installed correctly.\n\nMost of these Reviewer's complaints could of been resolved with call to Technical Support or by simply spending some time exploring the program.", "label": 2}

We wanted to upgrade our home laptop too.  Since this allows you to install on up to five PC's the pricing worked out better for us in the short term.  We didn't have to shell out $600 for three copies of Office 2013.\n\nGone, are the days of owning and installing a copy of Office on your laptop.  Typically, you'd replace a PC every five years, or so, anyway.  Most people would always install a new copy of Office on a new laptop, so you'd be purchasing a new copy for each machine at $200 every few years.  This ends up costing about the same or less if you are installing on multiple machines.  For installation on one machine, you might be still be better off to purchase a copy.\n\nInstallation was easy.  We installed it on the old laptop as well as the two new ones with no problems.\n\nAgain, the biggest advantage is that (for $99/year) you can install on up to five machines.  If you get rid of a PC, you can simply go to your Microsoft account and deactivate that copy.  That frees up a copy that you can download to a new PC.  Another advantage is that it remains updated too.

Geographic's 3D version. Nat. Geographic provides more features such as greater grid spacing options. But don't expect either to print with the resolution of the regular 1:24,000 USGS maps; both software brands have to default to a larger scale to get that kind of resolution and clarity at least with ink jet printers. National Geographic Topo's 50% default setting results in an approximate print scale of 1:31,000 which results in very good clarity. However even at 1:24,000 they are legible (although a bit fuzzy). They will both save you money verses buying the regular topo maps (after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink and paper costs) plus they give you advantages if you use a gps unit especially in overlaying grids, trail markers, etc., on the printed-out maps.

{"text": "I've been using Microsoft Word since 1985. I don't even remember the version(s) of DOS Word I used. For the most part, I found it worked in many areas better than anything else. It wasn't better than WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS, but then again, neither was most any software ever written. But Word XP/2002 is trash and I refuse to use it anymore. As I have been a Microsoft defender for years, that should tell you something.\nFirst, the outline numbering feature doesn't work. It hasn't worked since Word 97. If you want something in the form of I.A.1.a, etc., you better be prepared to do it by hand because while the outline styles will format correctly, the numbering will be off. You will have an a)1 and a)2, followed by a b)3 and b)4, as the number won't reset. I have been on the phone with Microsoft tech support at least 5 times over this one issue and none of the techs know 1/10th the Word I know. That in itself is frustrating, but the most frustrating part is 30 minutes into the conversation, they will say something like \"well, you have to click on feature ____ under the _____ window.\" Of course, I had already done that and it didn't work, hence the call in the first place. And, yes, I've reinstalled, and the system is state of the art (and then some).\nNow, Word likes to lock up on occassion. Not a real lockup like Windows locking up, but you can't use the keyboard or type in Word. For some reason, when I do a cut and paste or a c&p special, the document will lock up. If I wait, I can then type a letter or a few letters, then it will lock up again. I refuse to call MS tech support, and have posted this on a web site, but apparantly can't explain it well enough. The best way to describe it is the mouse pointer disappears, and no keyboard function works. I can move to a different application, and sometimes when returning to Word, it will start to work, but only for a few characters. I charge by the hour, but I can't bill clients for buggy software and time spent adapting to it. Until I find my copy of WordPerfect I had, I downloaded Open Office to do documents in.\nWhen it does work, the windows that appears sometimes on cut and paste functions is terribly annoying. And I don't care to speak to the rest of the features in this program (read my review of Word 2000 if you want to see that) since I can't get even the basic features to work right. I say stay the heck away from this or other MS products until they write stuff worth a darn.\nI don't know what's worse: the fact that MS released a new product as buggy as this or that they haven't fixed known bugs from a product released 2 cycles ago.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is definitely a program for the computer savvy. When it worked for me it was great...I got around very bad viruses twice. However, the degree to which it dragged on my write capabilities (I have a 1.2gig processor, 500+ meg of ram), and seemed to bog me down when running multiple programs at once led to write errors and eventually the need to reformat what became a hopelessly fragmented drive. This on my main computer that suffered from some of the shutdown problems typical of Win98SE. On another computer which I use far more gently, usually keeping one program at a time open, it seems to be fine, though the constant humming of the hard drive is a distraction. My sense is that it should be installed on a very clean machine after full fragmenting, disk scans, etc. for the utmost protection. Unfortunately the documentation does not provide ample caveats and warnings about possible problems -- a feature it has in common with other Roxio software. I may try another install and be far more careful with disk maintenance -- should be done from dos or safe mode -- and shut down, but the jury is out for awhile because I use an excellent Mijenix program which allows me to easily go back to older system settings when things start to screw up. Careful backing up of files, virus checking and firewalling may provide ample protection for most users.", "label": 2}

The last third of the game was almost impossible for us to figure out. (Plus we were running out of patience by then.) There was one puzzle that we found particularly challenging (the moving rooms ) and I don't think we ever would have figured it out without cheating and looking up the solution on the Internet. So while I liked the mystery element of this game, I thought it was too hard. (Granted this was our first Nancy Drew game. I'm hoping others are a tad easier.)

{"text": "I bought this as a renewal for the occasional use of Office in our family. My kids are both college students so sometimes they need to produce soft copies of papers in a MS file name.\n\nWhen the key code arrived, I updated it to my account and then handed the card to my son, assuming that this worked like every other multi-computer key coded software on the planet. It doesn't. My account changed to reflect that my subscription expired and my son's sign-up created a new account. I didn't know about this until MS contacted me to let me know that my service had expired. I followed their instructions and the date simply did not update - no explanation of why or what happened. No error message. The process simply didn't result in an updated expiration date.\n\nSo after sorting through MS web pages for 20 minutes to actually get service I could contact, I chatted with online help, who seemed confused themselves, didn't answer my questions and who ended the chat without helping 10 minutes later. How do they expect a customer not to be frustrated by the time they even find access to online chat? Just because they don't know the answers themselves, they could check with someone else rather than ending the chat.\n\nThere are other similar office suites available that are both cheaper and similar in functionality. Some even allow files to be saved as MS file types. I bought this product because I'd used it professionally for years. I had no idea the product and especially service degraded to this level. After this experience I don't think I'll ever buy Office again. It's too bad Amazon won't allow this to be returned at this point.\n\nSo I now understand that you can only have one online account despite the up to 10 machines it promises to cover. Does that mean that only one person can use it and is expected to use it on 10 different computers and tablets? How does a second or third person access and use the software on another computer?", "label": 0}

{"text": "The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.\n\nThe full review:\nMore to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First of all, I think that the Nancy Drew games are wonderful. The developers have done a great job in the creation of these software programs. I have met fans of these games that are young girls, elderly adults, and even urban, teenage guys. With their affordable prices, you can't go wrong with a Nancy Drew software game.\n\n That said, this is one of my least favorite games in the series. It starts out well - Nancy takes a trip out west to a working ranch where there are phantom horses, treasure lore, historical romance, and quirky characters. The visuals are lovely and the music is fun. But, the enjoyment of solving the mystery quickly gets lost in the tedious tasks that make up most of the gameplay. There are a lot of puzzles and clicking activities that are required to complete the game. Normally, puzzles add interest and intrigue to the gameplay process. In this case, however, the sheer number of mundane tasks and procedures make the game frustrating and, often times, boring. For example, doing a detailed pixel search to find ten arrowheads scattered around the game...trying to bake a cake ten times because much of it is trial and error...playing the same gameboard on an arcade game fifteen or twenty times to receive a necessary prize, etc. Many of these tasks are built into the storyline, such as the daily chores of picking vegetables and gathering eggs. Although these activities help give the game an authentic \"ranch experience\", they come at a sacrifice of the actual mystery-solving. I wish that the developers had spent more time creating a multi-dimensional sleuthing experience, and less time coming up with random puzzles and trivial activities. In fact, it feels like many of these activites were added just to extend the playing time and drag out the gameplay. This is certainly a case where quantity is not better than quality.\n\n The developers also used a new visual format to create a larger action screen. The tools and objects that Nancy uses are now in pop-up menus that are activated at the bottom of the screen. The dialogue box also pops up during conversation and then disappears. This design makes sense in theory, but adds to the frustration during gameplay because of the additional pointing and clicking that is required. At times, it was also awkward to maneuver through the scenes - you might see an item of interest but have to turn around or back up before you could actually click on it.\n\n That said, I am not sorry that I bought the game. If you are a fan of the Nancy Drew games, or if you are interested in horses, ranching, etc, then you will probably want to buy this game. However, if you have not played a Nancy Drew game before, I would advise that you pick a different game to start in the series, such as Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, Treasure in the Royal Tower, or Message in the Haunted Mansion. In my opinion, those games are more enjoyable for their pure sleuthing fun. If you like the Nancy Drew games but would also enjoy a more adult-oriented mystery game, then try the Law and Order software series.", "label": 2}

The user interface isn't the best, but it's workable. The problem is that the software is so unstable as to be useless: Imagine working on a design for a couple of hours and have the program crash. What's that I hear? I should have saved it? I did save it. Frequently. Unfortunately, the save file was corrupted in some way that once I load it, the program crashes almost immediately. If you must use this product, save frequently and to new file names.\nAnd even when this product worked, it didn't work well. I tried several roof lines for a very basic house layout and most failed profoundly. Modifications I did in one view would be lost after switching to another view and back again. I can't adequately commuicate the frustration of using this poorly written software.\nBy the way, the system I was running on was a very fast (1.1Ghz) system with 512Mb of RAM, so there shouldn't have been a memory or speed problem.\nDon't buy this program.

Problems include: Can't change ceiling and floor Height in rooms; Can't define the Hinged side of Doorways; Lost Support Pillars from Ver 3.0; Still limited control over roof; Internal dimension lines randomly measure from the outside or middle of the wall instead on the inside; Room sizes in m2 are wrong; Can't print on A3 format; Text with Arrows doesn't work, Can't create half height walls.  Other issues: Stairs, still limited possibilities; Can't place plants or other objects on Concrete Slabs; Would be nice to be able to show slopes on Land around the house; Would like to be able to create windows in the roof; In 3D mode, it would be nice not to see through windows and doors i.e make windows opaque; if you change the colour of an object in one room, all the similar objects change as well.\nHopefully they bring out a patch release to this soon.

{"text": "I have the earlier CD-ROM version of The Complete National Geographic, and was attracted because this one is not only more up to date but takes up far less space. Surprisingly it is not so good. It takes an interminable time to load. Not only is it much harder to use \"SEARCH\" but it lacks the facility to rotate pages. The National Geographic throughout its history has printed many of its pictures sideways on the page, and so if you use a desktop, they are extremely dificult to see properly unless you are athletic enough to turn your head to be horizontal to the floor. All right with a laptop because it's easier to rotate the whole thing. But what a crazy omission.\n\nI found that one entire issue in the 1950s has been reproduced twice and defied the index.

But if you are creating a site for a real organization, AVOID it.\nFrontpage tries to do what lots of programs do-- take a complex task and simplify it, letting the software do a lot of the thinking for you.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the program without difficulty, but with the same result (except the error message popped up at different times) for a total of four attempts at \"add another OS.\" Incidentally, I chose to not make the boot disks, as this is a new computer with nothing important on it yet, so I could more easily restore it than rebuild it. So, I then decided to create the new partition manually. I am closer to \"novice\" than \"experienced,\" and I did have a few false starts.

{"text": "Simply put, my idea of decent CD burning software is one which supplies you options for copying, organizing, and storing information on a compact disk, and interacts with your hardware to get the job done. It should also interefere with the computer and its operating system as little as possible. Nero's software did none of the above for me. The software provides \"wizards\" to aid the inexperienced software user through the burning process; it also allows you to bypass the wizards and manually control settings. Either way, the software behaves clumsily. The \"wizards\" are idiodic examples of cryptic pseudo-simplicity which performed poorly for me, while the manual settings are arcane and difficult to manipulate. The software does not come with a printed manual, but with an extremely awkwardly written electronic version (in fact, I think the manual might just be incorrect, as I followed its \"Step by Step Instructions for Copying a CD\" and found out the steps to be incomplete and to produce results inconsistent with those listed in the manual) which one must click back and forth onscreen between software and instructions. In addition, loading the software on my computer (which is equiped with Windows 98 SE) produced DLL errors which interfered with the computer's operations and were time consuming to fix. In sum, instead of accomplishing the business at hand, this software forced me to decipher its impossible instructions and to hunt down DLL files and tinker with my computer -- a colossal waste of time.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is my honest review of the Adobe Dreamweaver Learn by Video.  The DVD comes in a standard plastic disc holder in a cardboard box, which is part of the whole box package.  It DOES NOT come with Dreamweaver CS5.\n\nI thought it was a standard video DVD.  It is in fact a program that has to be executed (without installing anything on your computer.)  I am running it on a PC workstation.  My antivirus/spyware programs have not gone off yet, so there does not seem to be any malware associated with it.\n\nThe video contains over 12 hours of video instruction, and is accompanied by a printed guide book to teach the fundamentals of Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  It also goes through some basic principles and fundamentals of web design.  The presenter (Candyce Mairs) is a clear and eloquent speaker, and is an Adobe Certified Instructor.  The video runs in the middle of the window, and you can select to have the sidebar available or hidden.\n\nFirst few chapters are very basic.  It is intended for those who have little or no background/experience with the terminology, such as \"URL\" and \"domain name.\"  Yeah, it's goes to the fundamentals.  I like the subtitle at the bottom of the video.  The first few chapters are so basic that I actually started writing this review while I the video is running on the other monitor (I have a dual-monitor setup).  The first chapter is dedicated to HTML fundamentals and also acts as a refresher for those who have the experience.  The second chapter is an introduction to what Dreamweaver is and what it can do.  Chapter 3 is a \"Quick Start\" chapter that gets the user setup with putting together a homepage (basic starter layouts, building the homepage, creating header area, etc.).  There are some tests at the end of each chapter to help reinforce what you've learned.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-This is a book designed for beginners.  As such, the first few chapters will be mostly overview and fundamentals.\n-The DVD comes with a guide book.  It helps with the video, and it can be brought around so you can read it without the video.\n-The course layout is logical, and therefore it makes sense.  I've seen so many poorly designed guides that jump all over the place, and this video guide is not one of these.\n-Having the a \"video\" of what the speaker is talking about really helps.  You can follow what the screen should look like.\n-The caption at the bottom of the video.  This was such a major positive.  A+++\n\nWhat I did not like:\n-The startup was not as straightforward as I expected.  Again, no big deal, but I can see how this could be a problem for those who do not know how to enable autostart, or those whose antivirus prevents the startup of an .exe file.\n-The DVD could have came with the trial version of Dreamweaver.  No big deal if you have a fast internet connection, but I know a few people who are stuck with a slow DSL speed.\n\nIn the end, you'll be familiar with the program's interface, and hopfully you will learn how to use the essential commands and tools to create and design websites.  It also identifies some areas that are typically and easily overlooked.\n\nThe book (printed guide) is glued onto the packaging with those sticky gel dots.  Though it can be separated from the box, it was not immediately obvious and I ended up carrying the entire package with me.  I wish the book was kept separated or maybe in a pocket.  No big deal.\n\nOverall, it is a nice beginner's guide to becoming familiar with and using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  Highly recommended.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This review is strictly for people like me...beginners in the field of digital photography...who love digital photography so much, you want more and more stuff associated with it! But do you need this much photo software?\nIf you're like me, you already of course have photo software on your computer...I already had the MY PICTURES XP software, the Dell photo software, the ArcSoft photo software that came with my Canon scanner, the HP photo software that came with my HP printer, the PictureIt! photo software that came with MSN 9 internet service, and the Kodak EasyShare software that came with my camera.  Oh, and just today I got the Ofoto photo software that came with my first Ofoto archive CD, which contains my film photos.\nSo, what in the world did I buy this for? Well, I got it half price, and I guess I was thinking the Digital Image would become the Almighty photo software, which would allow me to discard all the others.  Wrong! It has not worked out that way.\nThis software has a great library, but so does the PictureIt! that comes with MSN 9.  It's actually like the same Microsoft library. The Kodak software also has a great album library...only many time the photos are there only in thumbnail, and the files are in some other software library...at which time I must go find the photo file, right click, and open it with the Kodak software to get it back there.\nBut why would I want it back there, you ask...well, as it turns out, the Kodak software is the only one that flawlessly controls my Iomega external CD burner.  The Kodak software also seems to make better prints, than when I use the HP software, which is what I must use with the Digital Image.  Moreover, the Kodak software is simply easier and less time consuming.\nOf course, the Digital Image has tons more editing features and such.  So, what you need to ask yourself, if you are a beginner like me, is do you have the time and interest in exploring massive photo software?  If you do, this is an excellent program to get.  If you do not, you may want to save your money, and just use one of the easier, less costly softwares...such as one you already have.\nThis does come with a huge manual, which I was so pleased about, since I am an avid reader of manuals.  Yet, I'm afraid the manual is not that detailed!  It's odd--it even devotes lots of pages to a photographer who discusses her adventures with digital photography.  Gee, if I wanted to read such stories, I would have gotten a photography book! This was suppose to be a detailed manual, but in my opinion, it fell short. Also, all the \"auto-fix\" editing devices have fallen short--the Kodak software does just as well in fixing photos.\nI intend to come back and edit this in the future, if I discover I can't live without this Digital Iamge software. But right now, I could.  Easily. I just don't have the time to explore it all right now, or to troubleshoot the problems it has with the Iomega burner. In just a few minutes, I can burn hundreds of photos on a CD-R with the Kodak software.  When I use this software to burn CD-Rs, it's one bizarre problem after another.  I'd just rather spend my photography time taking pictures...not editing them...or troubleshooting software or hardware problems.", "label": 2}

I have used the Franklin Covey Day Planner and really enjoy how it has gotten me to prioritize my tasks and keep information at hand, and so finally caved and bought the software.\n\nPlan Plus must be used with Microsoft Outlook (not Outlook Express), so make sure you have that on your computer before getting started.\n\nFirst, several things I like about Plan Plus: it puts everything on one page-your calendar, a small monthly calendar where  you can one-click to any day's schedule, a view of today's schedule, a look at your inbox/preview pane, and today's prioritized tasks.  It's great.  The prioritized tasks, for anbody not familiar with the Franklin Covey system, allows you to create new tasks (and have them recur), set due dates, and prioritize them (A=Must do, B=Normal priority, C=Not important) so that you can easily see what needs to be done.  What most people don't always realize in life is that important tasks (i.e. long-term planning) are not always urgent, while some urgent tasks (email messages/ telephone) are not always important.  I also enjoy being able to sync these tasks with my Pocket PC and take that wherever I go.\n\nThings about Plan Plus that I don't really use.  I don't use Power Notes, which allow you to write directly on the note and scribble anything you want.  To be honest, I have yet also to really utilize the goals and compass aspects of the software.\n\nI have never had Plan Plus make my computer crash, although my computer is relatively new (Pentium 4).  It takes about five seconds to load, and another five seconds to call up all of my tasks.  You decide whether that's too long for you.\n\nIn short, I like Plan Plus, and I'm glad I bought it, but at the regular price of $80, I'm not sure it's exactly a steal.

{"text": "I'm a faculty member at a small college, and I agreed to do community service page for a local organization (because I know a bit of HTML, more than anyone else in the group).  We wanted the web page to look slightly more professional that I thought I could develop from scratch, so I ordered the \"free one month trial\" of FP 2002.  FP seemed easy enough to use, although the \"help\" options lacked info I needed and there is NO manual.  There was a glitch with how the program generated custom link bars (my page displays ugly file names, such as \"contact_1.htm\" rather than page names like \"Contact us!\" on the buttons of the page's link bar), but figured I could clean up with just a little help - there must be some trick that they don't explain in the minimal instructions provided.  Naively believing the big Microsoft ads claiming \"free on line support within 24 hrs for all retail users\", I shelled out more money for the \"academic version\" from a college bookstore, thinking I was buying the \"help\" service as well - only to learn (after a week of non-answers - none within 24 hrs) that this support is NOT available, because I have what they call \"a stand alone version.\"\n  Not comprehending that this denial of promised support could possibly be legal, I posted this problem on a FP2002 user's group and got a reply from another user that he'd paid FULL price and STILL was given no help beyond basic installation.  (Apparently in addition to non-standard HTML, Microsoft also has a non-standard definition of \"retail\", hidden someplace in the fine print of that user's agreement.) We may get our questions answered only for $? per (which I refuse to do as a matter of principle, to not reward misleading advertisement).  If I had it to do over, I'd have stayed with the free web-development software from our web service provider, rather than spend time, money and psychic energy on FP 2002 - I'm out a lot of monet and the site still doesn't look all that good.", "label": 0}

It does allow you to quickly design most landscape and deck designs possible and the 3D is drawn quickly and the detail is excellent.  Trees and plants for many California locales are lacking, but it is possible to use a variety of trees/plants that will give you a good idea of what you are after.

Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.\nI am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported.\nIs it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?

Well - they don't work in Windows 2000. And if you install them, thinking one day you might get around to using them, well don't. They'll screw up your system. I'm not just saying that either. After days of frustration because my computer wouldn't boot right up, I found on Roxio's Web site that they recommend NOT installing those two programs because they don't work right on Win2K and will cause hang-ups on boot (in some cases up to 2 hours). They are \"legacy\" applications that work better with Win95 or 98. If you have an NT based system (like Win2K and XP) you'd best not waste your time. So do a custom installation and uncheck those two programs. You don't need them anyway.\nAnother tip, if you are upgrading from another CD burning software package, best uninstall it first and reboot your computer then install Roxio. Don't want any trace of a competitor's drivers or things might not work properly after the installation.\nOK tip number 3 and that it... If you have Windows Media Player 7 installed, make sure that the Roxio CD burning plug-in is NOT installed. It also causes problems. Microsoft and Roxio are pointing the finger back and forth trying to figure out who is to blame, but who cares. Just remove it from WMP7 if you are upgrading to EZCD 5 Platinum.\nSo after all that, I'm still giving a 3 star rating. The installation difficulties by themselves warrant a -50* rating, but the CD & Data burning applications are top notch which is why I bought it in the first place. I'd give it 5 *'s if it weren't for the funky installation and useless add-on programs. They have really improved the interface (looks very Mac OSXish) over version 3 & 4. It really is easy to use (even my husband can burn a CD!) and I applaud Roxio/Adaptec for that. But they got carried away with the rest of the applications which hurts their stellar rating... until next time.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Too bad Amazon won't let me rate this product at less than 1 star, because it doesn't even deserve that.\n\nLike many other Mac OS Lion users who have been abandoned by Quicken/Intuit, I've been looking for another finance app.  I was using demo versions of iBank, See Finance, and MoneyDance side by side for comparisons.  The jury is still out on the other two, but MoneyDance is now in my Trash Can.\n\nImport of previous data from Quicken was a disaster.  I was in the habit of saving new Quicken Data files every year, so I have multiple data files.  Even just working with my current data from 2011, the result was utter chaos.  MoneyDance imported transactions without carrying over the opening balances, so all my accounts were screwed up and I had to correct the opening balances manually.  Then I discovered that vast numbers of transactions were being duplicated because they were transfers from one account to another (for example, paying my mortgage involved a transfer of funds from \"Checking\" to \"Mortgage\".)  My account balances were hopelessly screwed up.\n\nI deleted all my data and started over, this time I exported each account from Quicken individually.  So I had separate QIF files for checking, savings, mortgage, etc....\n\nStill had to correct all the opening balances by hand.  And since \"checking\" was the first account I started with, each subsequent account that I imported screwed up my transactions & balances even more.  So I had to delete \"Checking\" AGAIN, create it again, and then re-import all my transactions and correct the opening balance again.\n\nIt was then that I realized that NONE of my old Quicken categories had been carried over into MoneyDance.  I now have thousands of transactions in multiple accounts with no categories for any of them.  I am not about to go back and manually enter all that info.  So therefore the Reporting features are worthless to me.\n\nAnd oh, by the way, all the old accounts that I deleted mysteriously kept reappearing.  I deleted them again, and they reappeared again.  With the result that I had multiple accounts named \"checking\", etc.  And I accidentally imported a year's worth of transactions into the wrong one, so had to start all over again.\n\nThis is just ridiculous.  Doesn't anyone test this software before releasing it to the public?  SeeFinance imported all my data from Quicken correctly the FIRST time, with all associated categories and opening balances.  iBank didn't... I had to enter the opening balances manually again, but at least it handled my categories correctly and old deleted accounts stayed gone.\n\nMy advice to all Mac users looking to transfer data from Quicken:  stay the heck away from MoneyDance.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I don't know about comparing this item to Rosetta Stone. RS is very expensive. It's extraordinarily expensive.\n\nInstant Immersion is a great starting place to introduce foreign language to children: 1. It's interactive, engaging and entertaining. 2. It's a less-expensive alternative than other programs.\n\nThis is better than a textbook or from a class. 1. Correct pronunciation is at your fingertips. You just can't get that from reading. 2. Associate visual and audio cues to aid in learning. 3. I don't have to worry about the smart kids dictating the pace of the class.\n\nBased on a recent study, it was determined that repetitive testing (practice exams) help us develop cues to learning foreign words. For example, windu is Swahili for clouds. It's easy to associate \"wind\" with clouds. The reason I mention this is that these software programs can significantly aid our brains in developing multiple associations. We see the pictures, we hear the speaker and we determine the rate of our learning progress.\n\nThe negative: Discipline. It's tough to sit down and dedicate the time needed to learn the language unless this is made part of an after-school assignment or maybe a homeschool learning objective. For me personally, it is easier to \"have to go to class\".

{"text": "This game was a birthday gift for a slot-addict friend who likes playing the Monopoly-themed slots in the casinos.  Infogrames already released an earlier version of Monopoly Casino, but I never bought it because a lot of reviewers were complaining the slots were not accurate representations of the casino slots.  I figured  the complaints would be addressed in this new version.  Instead, Infogrames went the opposite direction and completely eliminated the casino slots from the release.  Because of this, my gut reaction was to give this game one star and trash on it - how can you not include actual Monopoly slots in a \"Vegas Edition\" of Monopoly Casino?  But I'll be fair because there are a few well-done games included in the package (as well as some other major blunders.)\nThe game installs easy enough but there's no option to run the game from the CD so it takes up about 90MB of hard drive space.  I've played all the games and haven't run into any system crashes, so the beta testers get a thumbs-up.  The 55 page manual is small, but adequate - giving you enough basic information to be able to play the games, but not necessarily the strategies needed to play the games well.  The Infogrames marketing department was working overtime with such catchy phrases as \"Ultra Realistic Casino Floor!\" (just one simple screen you click on to go from one gaming area to the next) and \"Over 245 Popular Game Variations Guarantee the Fun Will Never End!\" (which basically means you can set the same 12 slot machines to nickel machines, quarter machines, or whatever - - whoopie!)  The graphics and sound effects are sharp with probably the best looking tables and slots I've seen in a casino game.  The swing/ragtime themed background music is catchy, but there are only 3 or 4 songs included so they start to get annoying after a while.\nFrom a visual perspective, this game gets high marks, but it's in the accuracy of the gameplay - especially the most popular games - that this game falls off a cliff.  It's apparent these programmers have never set foot inside a casino.  To keep this review from turning into a book, I'm only listing the pros and cons of the most popular games:\nBlackjack: 1. No single deck blackjack, are they crazy? 2. No even money payout when both the player and dealer have blackjack. 3. In the casinos you are given one card when you split aces.  In this game, not only can you hit, but you can even double down on split aces. 4. Cards are dealt slow enough to get annoying and there's no option to change the speed. 5. A funny part of the game is when you bust, the dealer says \"LLLoooser, I'm sorry.\"  It's bad enough that you lost the hand, but now you've got this dealer calling you a loser, then apologizing for the fact that you are a loser.  You can't help but laugh.\nCraps: (Craps players will hate this game) 1. When you're the shooter, your bankroll is obscured.  You don't know how much money you have to bet. 2. When betting multiple chips you can't verify how much you've bet.  A simple pop up window next to the pointer would have avoided this. 3. Computer players do stupid things like playing the pass and don't pass line at the same time. 4. Place bets are returned to you once your number is rolled (never happens) 5. Even though you bet the minimum on the pass or don't pass, you're not allowed to toss smaller bets in the prop box; which casinos allow. 6. Can't work the odds on a come-out roll, even though the book says the option exists. 7. Still waiting for a craps game that includes three-way-seven or hop bets. 8. The only nice feature in this game, one I haven't seen in others, is your chips are marked with a monopoly token you select (battleship, horse, iron, etc.)  making it easier to distinguish your bets from other players. It's not enough to make up for all the other blunders, however.\nRoulette: I'm not an expert player, but the game seems to look and play well.\nKeno: The game looks good and plays as if you're in the restaurant betting on the numbers while scarfing on the all-you-can-eat buffet. There's no \"fast-deal keno\" (resembling casino video machines) and no option to change the speed that the numbers come up.\nPoker: 7 Card Stud, Texas & Omaha Hold 'em is offered as well as hi/lo versions.  No low money tables.  Like all card games here, you can't change the speed the cards are dealt but they're dealt at a decent speed.  You are also forced to play with seven players.  Fortunately the computer players play and bet very fast so you're not stuck waiting if you fold on the initial deal.  The computer AI seems good too - enough bluffing and random raises to keep you guessing.  Single player only, but poker fans may like this game.\nPai-Gow Poker: There's a bug in this game that costs you money.  In your two-card hand, if you tie the high-card with the dealer you lose, even if your second card is higher than the dealer's.\nThe standard slots are accurate in the fact that you get to watch your money slowly disappear (some people find that entertaining), but it's the three video slots that really shine.  Monopoly 500 allows you to place a side wager on a car you choose and the cars race toward the finish line based on how many times they show up on the spinning reels.  Whodunnit is a combination of a slot machine and the game Clue.  Mr. Monopoly disappeared and you have to guess who took him, what car was used and where the kidnapping occurred.  It's interesting to see a slot machine that also requires a little strategy because you eliminate suspects as they show up on the spinning reels and adjust your guesses accordingly.  Correct guesses earn you additional credits.  My favorite of the three, Direct Hit, is a combination slot machine and the game Battleship.  In addition to spinning a 4-reel slot with traditional payouts, 4 shots are randomly fired on a 5x5 grid containing battleships you place.  If you sink 8 ships, you gain the ability to make any reel &#8220;wild&#8221; at any time and gain additional credits.  However, there are also submarines on the grid.  Hit four of them and you lose everything and are forced to start over.  It adds another element to the game because you're fighting the greed factor &#8211; &#8220;do I take the guaranteed 60 credits now or take a shot at 2000 credits with the possibility of losing everything?&#8221;\nThere are other minor annoyances &#8211; the game doesn't automatically cash out your credits when you leave a machine, you can't change the betting denominations without leaving the machine entirely, and the video poker machines, while nice looking and similar in gameplay and payoffs, deal the cards too slow to be anything but aggravating over time.  The game does give you stats on each session at a table, but it would've been nice to include overall win/lose statistics on the different games.  On a positive note, the Bingo game is excellent.\nOverall, I can't recommend this game because the only good games are the &#8220;non-Vegas&#8221; games like the video slots and bingo; poker being the notable exception.  Roulette and keno are ok, but no better than many other programs.  Traditional Vegas games, like blackjack, craps, slots and Pai-Gow are awful.  The saving grace would have been online or multiplayer options, but that's nonexistent.  For the best all-around casino game, Hoyle Casino is still the king, for video poker, get Multiplay Video Poker by Masque, for fun (traditional) slots, check out Reel Deal Slots by Phantom EFX.  If you like (single-player) poker and bingo, or the video slots I mentioned sound interesting to you, then you might get your money's worth.\nWhat?  You're still reading this?  Well, I hope it helped because I sure wasted a lot of time writing it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've been using a number of different language software programs as research for a thesis.  I've enjoyed using the Rosetta Stone software to study German, Arabic and Japanese.  I have lived in Japan and I had studied Japanese for a number of years before I came across this software.  It was my first time studying German and Arabic.\nMy biggest problem with Rosetta Stone software comes from the complete lack of any explanation of the basics of the target language.  The theory here is that you will learn the language as a child does by seeing pictures, hearing the words and making the connection.  This idea in practice can be a lot of fun and you should be able to pick up some vocabulary and sentence structures in a very short time (as long as the language uses an English alphabet).  However, without a few basic pointers on the writing systems of languages like Japanese and Arabic, good luck figuring anything out.  For example, if you did not know that Arabic is written and read from right to left with the letters joined together as in cursive English, you stand little hope of ever being able to break words and phrases down into the 28 Arabic alphabet's characters.  It wasn't until I went to another source outside the Rosetta Stone software that I realised my massive error in trying to decipher the most basic script.  This could have easily been avoided had the software offered a few pages of explanation, or even just the alphabet itself spelled out with English letter approximate equivalents and an arrow pointing from right to left.  And Japanese?  The same problem times 3 (the number of written character styles in Japanese) and just as confusing.\nFinal review then?  The Rosetta Stone software by itself can be quite useful as long as you are after listening and speaking skills only AND you don't think you'll ever need to see and read the word as you hear it.  However, if you were hoping to learn reading and writing in a target language that uses a writing system other than the English alphabet, be prepared to go hunting for additional resources as a primer before you start banging your head against this Stone.  After an hour or so of basic tutorial from an Arabic alphabet website, I got back on track with Rosetta, but I was quite annoyed that I ever had to make that extra journey in the first place.

{"text": "Have been a subscriber since the early 1980's (yes I am a dinosaur) and WSJ was the only newspaper I read for a number of years.  After News Corp takeover, however, there has been a steady decline in the quality of the reporting.  At the same time there has been a large increase in the number of AP Wire stories (not original) and non-business stories (sorry can't call it reporting).\n\nThe one thing the WSJ was good at was in-depth stories that took you into the boardroom and conference rooms of companies and really opened up the complex issues in business in easy to understand terms.  The stories were direct and readily exposed corporate corruption as well as great achievements.  Sadly, this deep reporting was something Murdock specifically targeted for removal - he felt the stories were too long.\n\nNow we are left with perhaps 40% of the original content plus quite a bit of fluff.  Much of the business \"reporting\" consists of repeating the press releases without independent analysis or commentary.  Worse yet, a huge amount of editorial bias has infected the non-opinion pages, to the extent that the credibility of the underlying reporting is in question.\n\nCheck out the on-line edition.  Any story that mentions Democrats has 50-400 bile-spewing comments from people vilifying individuals (e.g., commenting on Barney Frank's homosexuality in an article about the Fed's powers) and not even addressing the fundamental issues.  Debate is completely missing - instead it is a rant forum.  There are a couple of posters with the ability to construct a reasonable argument, but the majority of on-line posters have gut-felt opinions and stick to them regardless of the topic.  Unfortunately, the company seems to realize this is the new subscriber base, and seems to pander to it and we are worse off for it.  It is a very sad state of affairs.  For those less fortunate to have been a reader prior to the bias change, I can tell you that you missed the paper when it was its best.\n\nI recommend the Financial Times.  It is thinner - doesn't have the same level of content - but is almost strictly business and still includes unbiased commentary.  The slant is a bit non-US - so politics only surfaces when there really is something happening (as opposed to repeating Republican \"talking points\" daily like we see in WSJ) which is a bit refreshing, though I do enjoy a bit of politics for entertainment.  Interestingly, I have found that my horizons have expanded greatly since subscribing a couple of years ago.  I actually understand the world economy much better now since the FT includes articles about business from around the world.  I highly recommend it - and also recommend sticking to it while reading non-U.S. news (very boring at first since you probably won't have an international perspective) - you will probably find the broader perspective refreshing after a while.  You can get some great first-time subscriber deals.

{"text": "A few years ago, when designing 2 rooms at my office, I became fluent in most of the off-the-shelf, under $100 design programs.  I recall switching between 2 applications that each had great features, and would have made a perfect product if merged.  One was 3D Home Architect 3, the other (which I can't recall the name) had some similarities to Home Designer 6.  Having just tried 3D Home Architect 5 & Home Designer 6, I still have the same feeling: each has very strong & very weak points.\nHaving now sampled both applications, I can't seem to figure how so many people posted hate for 3DHA.  I think it's a tie between the two.\nMy big criticism w/ HD6 is that you cannot manually change wall dimensions.  It was incredibly tedious to recreate rooms based on the dimensions I had.  Apparently, the pro version ($500) allows this function, but I wasn't going to pay that for my little project.  When you click a wall you've created in 3DHA, it displays measurements to every other nearby wall.  You then can click any of those measurements to resize it manually.  This is the absolute most logical way to get exact measurements.\nIn HD6, the library of items is pretty skimpy compared to 3DHA.  3DHA easily allows custom items to show in the 'library' so it's easy to reuse them.\nAs for the 3D rendering, 3DHA really sucks.  It is incredibly difficult to get the camera view into custom positions.  This is where HD6 is best.  You can arrange multiple cameras in your layout, each corresponding to another rendered window.  You can also double-click the camera in the layout & it brings up other view settings such as height & field of vision angle.\nAs for working w/ your layout, 3DHA allows you to drag a selection tool over multiple items, creating a multiple selection.  You can then move all of those items at once, or select their properties.  For changing the color of multiple items, this is great.  HD6 does not allow you to select multiple items & then change characteristics of them.  Imagine having a room you want to change the color of all of the cabinets.  According to my findings, in HD6 you'd have to change each cabinet one by one.  In 3DHA you would just hold the shift key & select all of the cabinets, then make your changes.\nMaybe I'm asking for too much from <$100 programs, but it sure seems both programs make it much harder to do things then they have to.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I still have to argue that 98 is far superior to XP if it's treated properly.  My 98 box boots up to idle faster than XP can come out of hibernation.  Perfectly stable, it'll run continuously without needing to reboot when I let it.  While you do need 3rd party software for account-to-account security, that's a minor issue since we're running seperate copies of 98 on the same system (active partition swap, other one hidden).  And since it only takes a couple of seconds longer (literally, about 5) to reboot to the other OS than XP takes for logoff-logon, it's no problem to reboot.  The only virus I've ever \"caught\" was one I requested be sent to me.  The net's not that dangerous, I routinely browse for a few hours with firewall and AV off and don't get infected; it's more common sense than the OS, the software or the net.\n\nFast-User-Switching is a joke; RAS becomes unstable and our *security* software (major companies) can't always make the switch without dying.  And you can't enable it and make pages available offline at the same time (see what I mean about the security system being crap??).\n\nSeveral pieces of software I've tried that are supposedly compatible with XP aren't; they need to be installed as an admin but need to be installed for one of the users (admin doesn't need it, user can't install it).  Granted, it's as much the software's fault as XP's but if MS could come up with a decent d*** security system, the issue would disappear.  And, no, MS did NOT fix this with Vista.  I'm not referring to letting a user have temporary admin rights; I'm talking about not consolidating everything in the Windows core files so that nothing can be uninstalled properly and so that a program must get blanket god-rights to the system to drop a dll in the system folder (where MS decided it should go) instead of in it's own (OK, the second one's available, IF you want to be harrassed by the OS for each individual action).\n\nMany settings are per-user but can't be changed by the user.  They have to be upgraded to an admin or power-user simply to tell the system to idle down after 15 minutes instead of 30. Or to change the time.\n\nThere's no \"mini-OS\" that can be run off a floppy (like DOS with 98) and give access to a dead system. Why not? For one, MS killed DOS (no, that \"command prompt\" is not DOS). For two, NTFS can't be read from DOS.\n\nADS? Don't get me started about the OS actually having a second \"strip\" of data along each file that only certain programs can get to.\n\nHow about the built in you-can't-play-that-media-file parts?  That's a good one indeed.  My music and, as the RIAA itself said, I paid for \"the right to listen to it\" so I should *never* have to worry about the next version of DRM breaking it.  (let's see, Win98 in VirtualPC?  Rip away!)\n\nFinally, I managed to actually BSOD XP one of the first couple of times it booted.  While they did fix some of the error traps, you merely get a little box instead of a full-screen BSOD.  Big deal.  I'm not impressed with that \"improvement\" in the slightest.\n\nWhy would I upgrade if I despise XP so much?  Easy, d*** hardware driver companies are scum.  32bit Windows is 32bit Windows.  Software calls are the same (yes, I write software), returns are the same.  Heck, the drivers probably weren't even modified except to remove an OS from the \"accept list\".  I probably just bought my last piece of hardware that still actually has 98 drivers on it, when a major component of my system next dies, I probably won't be able to properly run 98 anymore and I'm about to run out of time to get XP (much later and I'd use Linux instead).\n\nWhy get Pro instead of Home?  Decent, granular permissions.  I can set folder-by-folder, user-by-user, action-by-action exactly who gets to do what.  Can't do that in Home.  Grey-area accounts: I can make someone a power-user so they can adjust their own power settings but still can't muck up other accounts.  Can't do that in Home.\n\nRumor has it there's a Win2000 clone built on a Linux kernel.  Maybe it'll be ready by the time I'm tired of XP...", "label": 2}

{"text": "#1)  The user interface is okay, but not intuitive. I am a technical writer, web designer and software support specialist, and it took me a while to figure out how things were organized. Right or wrong, I expected something of a Windows format, i.e. the FILE menu lists functions specific to filing, the EDIT menu lists things like copy and paste, etc... I'm not a big fan of the Microsoft Monopoly, but I have to tell you that most people expect things to look like Windows these days.\n#2)  The shopping list function does not reliably pull every ingredient from a recipe, and the entire \"have it\" column will clear whenever you try to modify an ingredient.  This was particularly frustrating to me when I was working on a weekly menu list and had a huge number of things checked! The software does not give you a \"modify\" button or something similar when you've checked all of your \"have it\" items, so that the only way you can look at just the things you need to buy is by printing out the list, which is a huge waste of paper if you have to make changes. When I tried to print a week's shopping list, the list came out in 12-point font which took up three pages (way too big! it's got to fit in a regular pocket or handbag, remember), and listed the items in a very confusing, hard-to-read format, with the section title (example: fresh produce) on the left, followed immediately underneath by the ingredient, and then to the far right is the actual item to be purchased. There's no line to guide the eye, and the formatting was rather clumsy so that you have to stop and stare at the list to figure out what you're going to buy, not to mention the fact that it seems silly to list the ingredient twice (i.e. \"celery, 1/2 cup\" and then to the right, \"celery, one package\").\n#3)  Entering or modifying foods is way too complex and extremely undwieldy. I wanted to go through the lists and take out the brand-specific names because I bargain hunt and don't buy any one particular brand. I found the brand names annoying, especially since they pertain largely to mid-west grocery chains that don't exist in California. I have so far found no way to list all the items; one has to search for them individually, and frankly, that's way too much effort just so the software can do what I want it to do.\n#4)  The recipes are all submitted by different people, and no one has taken the time to standardize them. I'm looking at one now - \"Toad-in-a-hole\" - in which the author tells me what kitchen utensils I'll need, and then tells me how to grease a pan and scrape the sides of a blender. I'm pretty sure I can figure out that I want to use a skillet all on my own, and I've been greasing pans for quite a few years now. It seems a bit unprofessional. Another recipe that I came across recently (sorry, I don't remember which one) left out a major step in the preparation of some chicken dish. I've found typos and incorrectly listed ingredients and other problems, and of course there are quite a few bugs in the interface between the recipe bookshelf and the meals section and the weekly planning section. I don't like that I can't copy a recipe straight into a book, but can only copy a chapter, even if I hate every other recipe in that chapter. I hate that the recipes seem to go out of their way to add fat and calories (fry in one cup of oil, mix in one cup of mayonnaise..... eyewwwww) and that there's no healthy section that I can find. I don't like how the recipe book shelf is organized, in that I find it overwhelming to choose a recipe from the list of books that don't seem to be organized in any particular fashion. I don't like how hard it is to populate the weekly menu with my own choices, instead of choosing their ready-made weekly plans. I don't like that when I click on a recipe in the weekly menu, I get the meal card and not the actual recipe, and I have to go to \"edit\" on the meal card and click on the name of the recipe there in order to get to the recipe. The software is full end-to-end with problems of this nature, and they, unfortunately, make it very clumsy and hard to use.\n\n#5)  The software has a lot of bugs. When I first installed it, the install didn't work right and a database was corrupted, which required I reinstall the software. Every fourth or fifth time I open it, I get some error message that I'm usually able to work through. If I try to open it after a copy is already open on my desk, the software isn't smart enough to tell me that a copy is already open, but instead gives me code error messages.\nIt just felt like DVO wanted to save some money, so they cut out the focus groups who might have given some really necessary feedback, and they employed really young and inexperienced programmers...", "label": 0}

Even though the requirements state the game is for Windows XP and I have Vista, I was hoping that by using the Compatible Wizard I would be able to make it work on my computer. The game installed without a problem and played the beginning of the game where is showed how the Zoomblinis were made into slaves and how they escaped. But then when the game itself started,(the first level) the game crashed. I tried several times of uninstalling and reinstalling but the game just crashed each time it got to the first level. The graphics were beautiful and the story line was great, if only the game would have worked.\n\nSo I finally uninstalled the game and decided to give it to my 4 year old great grandson since he had access to a computer with Windows XP.  No problem with installing or running the game on the computer with Windows XP. But I noticed 2 things about the game after is was installed. First of all, it did not show the first part of the game where you saw and heard the reason that led to the Zoombinis having to escape their slavery. But that was OK because my great grandson was more interested in playing the game than he was interested in the reason for the escape. The second defect I noticed about the game was that part of the game did not show--the part that had the menu icons. Since you could only see the edge of the icons, down in the bottom of the right hand corner, you had to guess which icon to click on to get what you wanted.  My 4 year old grandson had a hard time remembering which icon to push to get to the next level because you could only see part of the icon--many times we kept going to the map instead of the next level.\n\nMy grandson loves this game, especially the level where you make pizzas. We never got very far into the game because of the problems with the icons--just took too long to get to the next level after continuously pushing the wrong icon.\n\nMy daughter in-law's monitor is not a wide screen monitor, which is common very common now, so maybe this is part of the problem with the display not showing the whole screen for this game.

I was able to transfer over my basic information from my older Will, update, proof read it, and print it. I like that it even asks for an Obituary (if you care to write one) OR an information page that would assist family in writing an Obituary for you later. The directions seem thorough and easy. After printing the pages I took them to a Notary for Witnessing and Notary work. Very satisfied with this software and from the high number of 4's & 5's the majority of users also are.

{"text": "On an action packed adventure to \"Toys-r-us\", I purchased what I think were three Nancy Drew games. I am shamelessly addicted to them and am not intending to fix it. One of the ones I picked up was \"Nancy Drew - Curse of Blackmoor Manor\" and I forgot about it for some time. I was so hooked on Danger on Deception Island and others to remember this last one. But recently I found it and popped it in, excited I had something else to play.\n\nI'm surprised this game didn't trigger an anurism in my brian.\n\nThis game is VERY puzzle-happy. And while puzzles are great, they get really annoying. Any time you need to retrieve anything its another puzzle.  The little girl character, Jane, retains a lot of information you need, and the only way to get it out of the brat is by playing games with her that are more meticulous than entertaining.\n\nThe story is rather bad too. They set you up with what could have been an AMAZING story. Witchcraft, classic languages, money scandal...\n\nAnd then instead of really playing on any of that, they pour some oil into a hole in the middle of the night and you're shuffling about like a troll collecting random stones that you have NO idea how to use until the very end.\n\nI'll give it to Her Interactive that the characters were pretty good. Jane was a tad unrealistic and so was the curriculum being beat into her brain. Nigel Mookerjee sounds like he's telling a campfire story even in casual conversation, and Lady Whose Name Escapes Me At the Moment, she talks to plants. However their personalities were agreeable and some made me laugh a few times.\n\nI think the laughter prevented the anurism actually.\n\nIf your logic is impeccable or you like real brain busters, this game is for you.\n\nHowever if you like mystery, adventure, and well written story lines that keep you hooked until the very end, I don't recommend it, I didn't even finish the game.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nMain Entry: disclaimer\n\nPronunciation: -'klA-m&r\n\nFunction: noun\n\na : a denial or disavowal of legal claim : relinquishment of or formal refusal to accept an interest or estate\n\nb : a writing that embodies a legal disclaimer\n\nc : something you say to save your behind.\n\nDISCLAIMER: All those who are anurism victims or have family members who have suffered and or died from anurisms, please do not take offense to my careless throwing about of the word.

I like the fact that I can watch the video while having my copy of Lightroom open, so I can easily follow along.  In my opinion, my learning is enhanced by showing me how to use a function like the Adjustment Brush rather than simply reading about how to use the Adjustment Brush.\n\nIf you are a little intimidated by programs like Lightroom or Photoshop Elements, then this is a perfect video for you.

In my course, the book was used to introduce a number of topics that were discussed in further detail during class discussions, and it was supplemented by case studies, videos, and articles with more depth.  A non-academic reader would not have those enrichment elements available, thus would likely find the book less useful.\n\nThe book does not explain how to do anything (set up an online store, write a blog article, configure analytics, etc.).

{"text": "For most of us, Microsoft Office is the de-facto standard of office suites, with Word being the predominant program. It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\n\nThere are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.\n\nPlease note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.\n\n9/30/2013", "label": 1}

Third party content is even worse, since most developers don't even call the folders the same thing in the seven places where the content was installed.  The readme files are even worse, and they can't even fix on one naming convention for the readme folder.

The main problem seems be to be device driver related. I bought a new machine with ME installed and the fun started when trying to use all of my existing peripherals. Although my CD writer software was ME compliant I still had massive problems with stability. I know a few who had problem with ME without having any legacy kit. A non-technical colleague said to me \"my machine came with the version of Windows that crashes a lot\" - no suprises which version.\nMicrosoft added a few new features, such as system restore. It is a pity that it is so bug-ridden and resource hungry. On one occassion the system restore took me back six software installations instead of the one that should have been rolled back. After testing the concept out of us ME users you will be glad to know that it now works well in XP.\nUnfortunately if you like making HTML/ASP pages Microsoft saw fit to remove Personal Web Server from ME, although you can get it to work if your nerves are strong enough.\nMost of the other useful bits (latest versions of media player, IE) could be downloaded for 98.

{"text": "I bought this software for myself (learning keyboard) but I also have children. The software focuses on learning how to read music and also locating the notes on the keyboard. It would be helpful for children/adults playing any instrument. Most of the lessons are based on learning the notes on the scale, counting beats, etc.\n\nCons: The doodle pad composer does not save on my computer (I have vista) so when my son makes his \"masterpieces\" I can not save them to listen to later. Also the graphics are very dated. There doesn't seem to be any competition for this type of software so I guess that is why it hasn't been updated.\n\nOverall I think this is a good game and slightly overpriced ( I paid 45 on here but feel 30 would have been a better price since the game is older) I have finished all of the lessons but go back and do the games to improve my speed with identifying notes on the scale and the keyboard.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Compared to previous versions of Windows (like Windows 98, Windows 2000, etc.), Windows XP is excellent. It's much more stable than those previous versions, has excellent hardware and software support, and generally is pretty good.\n\nBut that's all relative: Mac OS X and Ubuntu linux (the latter being totally free) are both excellent in terms of usability, and frequently are easier to use for regular users.\n\nIf you need a general-purpose desktop computer for web browsing, word processing, and so forth...Ubuntu's the ticket. Free, secure, wide community support, great hardware support, etc. It's quite usable by average users, and definitely not as \"scary\" as other versions of linux. Power users can run most Windows programs in Wine (I play World of Warcraft regularly in Wine and love it).\n\nBut I digress...\n\nUnfortunately, Windows XP has it's downsides:\n- It's expensive.\n- It's vulnerable to a huge host of security issues (most are patched quickly, but it seems to be a never-ending process).\n- By default, it isn't all that secure -- user accounts are, by default, Administrators, so one can seriously screw up their system by fiddling around with stuff that they shouldn't be fiddling around with. Viruses that execute under an Administrator account have full access to the computer, and can cause significant damage. Internet Explorer and Outlook Express have more holes than swiss cheese.\n- Protecting against these security issues necessitates additional expenses like anti-virus/spyware programs. Fixing/cleaning up from virus infections can take hours, if it's possible at all.\n- Anti-piracy measures are ineffective at stopping piracy, but effective at annoying legitimate users. If you change more than a few hardware components (such as adding more RAM, installing a new graphics card, etc.) Windows disables itself and requires that you call Microsoft, explain what you did, and get an authorization code to re-enable Windows.\n\nIn today's computing world, there are many specific programs that require Windows to operate. But just about any task that's required, such as word processing, web browsing, design, communication, and so forth is also available for the Mac OS or linux, and those systems are (in my opinion) quite a bit easier to learn, use, and interact with and have advantages of security, performance, and in the case of Ubuntu linux, price.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Summary: EXTREMELY slow pace, awful stilted narration, redundant lessons and completely unprofessional page designs (imagine a mySpace page designed by a 13-year-old). HOWEVER, if you are a complete novice then this disc will teach you a lot. Just be prepared for a very very slow pace. If you've never designed a web page then this may get you started but it will probably leave you lost after a while, because although she spends a lot of time explaining things almost as elementary as how to use a mouse, she does not cover much of the most basic web design fundamentals you would get in a beginning course at a school. And you will only be shown extremely childish examples of actual visual design and layout of web pages. If you have designed a web page before, then there is probably 30 minutes of material at the end of the course that will be useful, and if you don't mind clawing your eyes out in frustration then you could take the time to watch some of the earlier lessons to learn about the Dreamweaver interface. However, as another reviewer noted, there is not detailed index, so you will spend a lot of time skipping through lessons to find the salient parts. There are many \"lessons\" where all she does is talk about what she is going to teach you in the next lesson, i.e. teaching you nothing.\n\nI used to code basic HTML by hand, but never learned CSS, so I wanted to learn it with this tutorial. I expected that to be part of the lessons but obviously not the majority. I also got Dreamweaver a while ago but haven't used it in years. I was patient at first, but then after a few hours of the most basic interface issues being hounded upon over and over again, I started skipping through lessons. And the author doesn't just give detailed lessons on how to use the Dreamweaver interface; she also goes in-depth to describe how to use basic OS functionality. Add to that her awkward, stilted speech and nasal voice (I'm not trying to be mean, but it just isn't professional), and I was pulling my hair out, even when listening to the lessons that I was interested in.\n\nExamples:\n\n* The bottom 10px of so of the screen in the videos is cut off, so that sometimes the narrator is referring\n  to something she's doing, but her cursor and what she's clicking on are not visible on the screen. In addition\n  there is a LARGE \"video2brain\" watermark obscuring some of the vital controls in the bottom right corner of the\n  screen, once again making it impossible to understand exactly what she is doing in the Dreamweaver interface.\n\n* An entire lesson (3:30 min) spent explaining how to create a new folder on your hard drive and change it's name.\n\n* Several minutes spent explaining how to open and close palettes and windows in Dreamweaver. (Not rocket science.)\n\n* Way too much time spent explaining basic OS/Browser functionality: Save/Save As functions, untitled documents,\n  naming HTML files, where page titles display on a browser window, how to bookmark sites in a browser and how\n  browser tabs work. None of this begins to expain how to use Dreamweaver, let alone build a web page.\n\n* The history of meta tags, featuring the quote \"It's a meta tag because it has HTML brackets and it says 'meta'.\"\n\n* An entire lesson (6.4) explaining how to select, copy and paste text -- elementary OS functionality. Really,\n  noting to do with Dreamweaver here! I'm not exaggerating. That was the lesson.\n\n* 5 minutes spent on making bold or italic text (not an exaggeration). Not via CSS either, just regular \"strong\"\n  and \"i\" tags, and using the clickable buttons [B] [I] to set them in Dreamweaver.\n\n* Time spent explaining how those little triangles on drop-down menus indicate that they are a menu with choices\n  that can be accessed. Didn't the first Mac television commercial in 1984 already cover that subject in-depth?\n  Or was that the Minesweeper tutorial?\n\n* Time wasted explaining how to select all text. Not something tricky about how to select text and not catch code\n  characters by mistake, just valuable time spent explaining that you could hit control-A to select all.\n\n* Six minutes and thirty seconds spent explaining what the different types of HTML links are. Not HOW to create them.\n  Not anything about styling them, or using javascript with them, or anything fancy like that. More than SIX MINUTES\n  explaining that you can have a basic hyperlink or an anchor link, perhaps talking about relative vs. absolute URL paths.\n\n* An example of her slow, wordy manner of speech. She adds 20px margin to something. Rather than saying \"that will\n  now add 20px around all sides of the object,\" instead she says it \"adds 20px to the right...the bottom...the left...\n  and the top edges.\" Now imagine that statement taking 10 seconds to utter.\n\n* The booklet is glued inside the box that the DVD comes in, so it is very inconvenient to reference or read\n  (bulky and inflexible).\n\nThis video was quite obviously not scripted. The narrator makes several flubs throughout and laughs about them. She CONSTANTLY repeats herself from one lesson to another, which wouldn't be so bad if it was just a reference to what she taught us in a former lesson, but she invariably re-teaches that lesson again, so that you are begging on your hands and knees to be taught something new, anything! If you want to see an example of the author's web design capacity, take a look at my screen capture added to the product photos, taken from this DVD, where she shows a picture of her personal website which apparently has templates available for download. It absolutely boggles the mind that this woman would be officially Certified by Adobe. And according to her bio on the product page, she is also a \"Certified Internet Webmaster.\" Let's dial the Wayback Machine all the back to 1995 and learn about what kind of responsibility THAT entails.\n\nLessons pertaining to CSS start at 11.2, which is dozens of lessons in. They do have some decent info.\n\nOverall, I think you can get better training by either going on YouTube (free! And some good stuff up there for specific issues.), or paying for a month of videos at Lynda.com, which is around half the price and much more professional. This DVD is overpriced and low quality. It does not live up to Adobe's otherwise impeccable standards.", "label": 0}

The panning, zooming in and zooming out functionality is an order of magnitude better in Streets and Trips than Delorme's Mapping Street Atlas.

There are more points of interest in Streets and Trips and the \"directions\" function is also much much easier to use.\n\nI found the Delorme product generally cumbersome to use by comparison to Streets and Trips which worked elegantly and seamlessly.\n\nThe GPS receiver OTOH worked fantastic!  It locked on to the satellites quickly and provided excellent real time location on the map.

Roxio should never allow this product to be sold without fixing the XP problem before it gets to the home user! What is really unbievable is that Roxio doesn't tell you what to do when you get the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH.

Also do a \"custom\" installation and DO NOT load \"TAKE TWO\" when installing ECDC5.\nI still have a bad taste in my mouth for Roxio, but ECDC5 seems to be working just fine on my WinXP Computer.\nHope this info will help save at least one person's sanity!", "label": 0}

Yes, I am aware that this review will be downsized but I am only informing pre-buyers of this waste of space.\n  Right now, I will inform you on the developer, Mindscape/Mattel. Mattel has put Mindscape up for sale. How does this affect the game? Lots. It prevents the development of any type of patches or needed materials to make this game better.  I will use the new playscene editor as an example. About 20 minutes into the game, I receive a white box telling me that I should close or debug this program. I do have a degree in program development and I decided to take a look at the bugs in this program.\n  I opened up my C++ editor and found many problems. Some occur with the toys or the playscenes. I, of course e-mailed the makers of this program and informed them of the spring-up of problems with their product and that I was not happy with it.\n  The main point of the Petz program is to enchant younger children with the wonder of virtual dogz, catz, babyz, etc. The newest version of this virtual petz game has been depressing. It was clearly aimed at the younger audiences as opposed to the older folk. The game comes with 11 breeds (in dogz 4 only) Bulldogs, Chihuahuas, Dalmatians, Mutts, Poodles, Scotties, Sheepdogs, Labradors, Great Danes, Pigs, and Dachshunds. The owner adopts a pet from one of the listed breeds and takes care of the \"animal\" by feeding, playing, and not neglecting it. When these dogz grow to an adult (after 5 launch days) they can bred with other adult dogz.\n  That is the basic point of this program. It is equipped with a clothes closet, toy closet, kitchen, family room, backyard, beach, and adoption center. The travel scenes are the \"buzz\" of this product. They include, Arabia, Gypsy Circus, South Seas, Snow Scene, and Wild West. I must inform you that these playscenes take about 4 megabytes of memory. This entire program takes around 223 megabytes.

The integrated audio files demonstrating pronunciation are a life saver and help demonstrate proper pitch accent to keep your own speech clear and comprehensible.\n\nThere's a lot of good vocabulary and grammar, and at the end of each chapter there are quizzes to help you judge how well you retained the material and also to practice. My only complaint is that the quizzes are often very large, making it difficult to learn smaller groups of vocabulary at a time, and that you are not able to generate custom, cumulative quizzes to test your knowledge overall.\n\nSomething I thought was lacking was the writing aspects. While the introduction to Hiragana is great, the material on Katakana is more stretched out, and many foreign words are first written in Hiragana because of your lack of knowledge in a certain chapter. Additionally, the Hiragana chapter has additional memory exercises, whereas the Katakana is limited to a matching game which isn't a particularly good way to memorize them. For this reason, I still haven't.\n\nAnd finally, in my introductory college textbook, even a few kanji are introduced per chapter as the book goes on. I'm not saying this product should have hundreds of kanji to teach, but I feel introducing some of the more basic ones would have helped.\n\nHowever, Human Japanese Intermediate should solve my kanji complaint, and I will of course purchase another amazing product from these developers.", "label": 1}

The images are small, black&white and poor quality - some so dark and grainy that I couldn't make them out even using a magnifier.\n  I was looking forward to using this impressive set, but it  isn't worth the trouble.

{"text": "This is yet another version of Windows which barely improves on Windows  95. This is basically an update for all the new devices and hardware that  are out there. At the core it still works the same as the last couple  Windows. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you have a brand new  computer, otherwise, like in my case, it will just slow down your computer  even more.\nThere are some small bonuses to this version though. It does  come with some ok games, and improved multimedia capabilities, but most of  these you could already download from the microsoft webpage. I have to  admit some of the more pestering points to Windows 98 have now been fixed,  but I'm sure most users will hardly notice. Many of the changes are just  cosmetic, or simplify a certain task.\nI have been using this version for  about a month now, and sometimes I want to uninstall it, it can really slow  things down at times, and it does tend to freeze my computer an aweful lot  more than previous versions. All in all, this is good for brand spanking  new computers, but for older ones, I would stick with older versions, your  system will just run faster.", "label": 2}

You change their diapers, feed them, put them to sleep, etc.  You can dress up your babyz in all kinds of clothing too.  As time passes the babies will grow older, and learn to walk and talk.  You can talk to them using a microphone and the software included in the game.  They will recognize your voice and will learn from you speaking.  The babyz also have their own personalities... some like mushed peas for food, others like mushed carrots.  The babyz will cry if you ignore them, and believe me, you don't want them crying!\nIt is fun... for a while.  When I first played it took me a while to get the microphone software to actually work.  The game will freeze too.  My game used to work fine, but now it won't work if I try to go to the kitchen.  It will then shut down.  Since the kitchen is where all the food is, that's a problem.

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.\n\nThe program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.\n\nIn these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\n\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\n\nIncluded in the program are \"checklists\"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as \"How to Form an LLC\" and \"How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting\".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\n\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated \"Book Reader\" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called \"Your Little Legal Companion\" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as \"Moving in with your Lover\" and \"Getting Old.\" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\n\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\n\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.

{"text": "I obtained this software in a kit that included the software on CD along with a cable for my phone (LG 1300, a model with no camera, but pretty much everything else).\n\nThe packaging for the kit I purchased is quite nice, however, the fancy chart incorporated into the packaging which gives phone compatibility is obviously dated, since my phone is not present on the list but is known to the software.\n\nMore interestingly, the CD in my package was blank (not defective, but actually blank!).  That was a bit startling.  Sending emails to the company (every email address on their web-site) produced absolutely no response.  I didn't bother to call since the idea of spending hours trying to reach a customer or tech service by phone that wouldn't respond to email seemed pointless.  Anyway, about 6 weeks later a replacement CD showed up in the mail, with no explanatory note.\n\nInterestingly, the replacement CD I received has a label on it that says \"if the serial # you have does not start with 'BJ' please replace the first 2 characters of your current serial # with 'BJ'\".  Evidently, they have had to send out a bunch of these.\n\nI remain totally mystified as to why Susteen didn't acknowledge any one of my emails and simply send me a download site (you can buy the software on-line by download, I believe).  I had a valid serial number after all.\n\nAs to the software.  My install was for XP (SP2).  The install was not clean (rejected the serial number, then took it on a second try).  The install didn't call for reboot, but I couldn't get connection to my phone until I rebooted, a minor quibble.  The software's autodetect feature did not work for my phone, even though it wasn't among the phones the software listed as being problemmatic.  I was able to successfully connect by entering my phone id info manually, although connecting this way failed on my first try (which is why I rebooted).\n\nThe connection appears to be a USB-serial replacement patch for an earlier serial version of the software.  Anyway, the install is actually a series of installs, one of which puts in a driver similar to those for USB-serial adapters, which may explain the somewhat flaky connection issues I experienced.\n\nOnce I achieved connection, I was able to upload/download my address info, including the stuff I already had on my phone, an important plus, since managing this was a primary motivation for wanting the software in the first place. Incidentally, this process also took two tries, even after I had successfully made connection.  I can't address the issue of syncing with Outlook, since Outlook has caused me enough grief over the years that I long since gave up on trying to sync anything with it.  I am interested in seeing if I can sync this software with my PDA, but suspect I will find it will need to be a manual process.  Frankly, given the rather low price for the software, I'm just happy that it actually can deal with basic capabilities of my cell phone.\n\nThe interface for handling ring-tones (assuming your phone supports this) is impressive given the evident playback limitations of a cell phone.  I imported a large midi file and easily dumped it to my phone.  Don't expect to do anything complicated with the software (there are much better products, albeit expensive ones, that do this; e.g., Sibelius), but the software does nicely display a staff line for each track, you can change the instrumentation on each track, modify notes, set tempo, and it downloads a reasonable rendition according to what the phone can play back (I dumped a lengthy Bach fugue onto the phone ... I suppose a 3-minute ring tone is a bit excessive, but it gives you the idea).\n\nIf your phone has wallpaper background (as my phone does), the software provides an image editor.  Just as with the music, you would probably be better off doing image work with another product.  Given the very limited display capability of the phone, you can't show much of an image anyway, but I did test it by putting a neat little jpg file I had on hand as my new wallpaper.  It certainly distinguishes my phone and is an improvement over the stuff put on the phone by my supplier (Cingular).\n\nThe software provides other facilities (calendar, text message management) that I have not tested because these are for features  I don't use my phone for (and probably never will).\n\nI can certainly recommend this software.  You do need to have a USB cable compatible with your phone.  If you are willing to poke around on the web, there are suppliers who provide them for most phones for as little as $10, otherwise do what I did and buy the kit.  Perhaps it's because I've used a huge variety of software over the years, but in contrast to other reviewers I found the interface to be just fine.  There is a nice pdf documentation file included with the software that provides a pretty complete hand-holding for those not inclined to decipher an interface by trial and error.  So why only 3 stars?  Well, if you encounter difficulty, it appears to me unlikely that you will get much help from this company.  I also thought that the install was unusually clunky.  On the other hand, once in, the software appears to be solid and delivers pretty much what I expected it to.", "label": 2}

Oh another thing, this product is dangerous when you select all file formats, it even took over my Corel Draw files, even webpage documents, I said to myself what is going on here. When I tried to open those Corel Draw files in Paint shop it gave me an error saying it was not recognised, come on whats happening here?\nYou know what I suggest? Buy a product thats actually dedicated and good at what it does, \"handling images\", I did not ask for it to handle CAD, Vector etc... A matter of fact whats the sense in spending the money when you already have a product that does the same thing with ease of use and simplicity. Microsoft Office already comes with the excellent Photo Editor and who doesn't have Office? Save the money and buy a product that does what its meant to do. If you want a product that really works, buy Photoshop Elements or Picture It! Digital Image Pro or stick with Photo Editor, plus it has a lot of editing tools.", "label": 2}

I moved the Star Office format and Office 97 format documents I  created between platforms without problem.  Star Office would easily a  four star product except for the fact that it wants to become your desktop,  presenting its view of the system rather that the one the OS presents to  you.

I really like the other features too like: a timeline showing the chronology of Biblical events compared to other world events; Each book has an introduction that describes the purpose of the book, the author, the historical setting, key verses, key people and summary to help you prepare for that book. There are notes breaking down just about every verse in each chapter to really help you get into the Word and then on each side, additional cross reference giving even more perspective.  In the back you have an index to all the notes, Maps, and Concordance with Dictionary\n\nThe thing I did not like about this version is that the paper used for the pages is super thin and they fold and curl very easily.

The biggest issue is the art history sections and crossword puzzles, full of painters that I've never heard of and trivia that seems largely irrelevant, over the head of most adults, let alone kids. There's no instructional material before the puzzles that introduces the kids to these painters, either; they're just expected to know it. I can tell that a lot of parents felt the same way, because whenever I googled to find an answer, I found that someone had already posed that exact, obscure question and gotten it answered online.\n\nSo maybe that's the point of this game. To teach your 5th grader-to-be about the power of online search. I suppose at that, it would be a success... but only if your child has the ability to access Google while playing, and/or if you the parent are willing to help with those puzzles.\n\nWe also had some trouble figuring out how to do the complex math problems, multiplying multiple digit by multiple digit numbers.

{"text": "This program is useful if you have an idea for a building and want to do a floor plan to get an idea of what it might look like.  That's what it's good for: walls, windows, doors, etc, simply a layout.  Forget furniture or fixtures.  Forget landscaping. Want construction details?  Forget it.  This program is strictly layout for idea purposes.  The 3D rendering is cartoonish as people say, but it's fast.  There's no five minute rendering process.  2D to 3D takes a second or two because it's low resolution, but if you make a change and want a quick 3D look then poof!  It's done.  Why one would want photo quality rendering is beyond me, and for 10 bucks how could you expect that?  My program never crashed once. I found placing walls down and having them snap together was easy.  There are easy handles on walls and such so that you can move a wall and all attached walls move as well.  Very easy. Definitely turn off the auto-save feature -- it won't work; use SAVE or SAVEAS on the menu for different versions of your project.  The only big gripe I have is that there is no furniture/fixtures at all, not even generic ones ... like a toilet or a bed or a generic cabinet.  When designing a bathroom, say, it's nice to know how much room is left after basic fixtures are introduced.  Another smaller gripe is that the default roof style is not a gable -- the type that almost ALL simple structures use.

Something in a recent SystemWorks' update had significantly impaired my computer's performance.  System booting slowed to a crawl and programs took longer to launch.\nSymantec's online support page attributed the problem to intermittent VeriSign server availability on Jan. 7-8 and directed me to VeriSign for a fix to the problem, but the update had no initial effect.  So in frustration I criticized Symantec's customer support and the way they had addressed the problem.\nIn the end, my operating system was not permanently crippled and I did not have to reinstall it.  Upon booting the system 2 mornings ago it had somehow, automagically, returned to normal.  Did the system need multiple reboots for the fix to take effect?

Perhaps questioning Symantec's trustworthiness was out of place.\nWhen searching for help, it was good to see that Symantec's online support page clearly acknowledged this particular problem in a well placed  \"Support Advisory!\" highlighted in red;  followed by a link to a page explaining the problem, what seemed to be its cause, and a possible fix.

{"text": "An inexpensive \"try me\" alternative to the Rosetta Stone.\n\nThe Instant Immersion language series is based on the same learning principle as the Rosetta Stone:  Natural Learning.  It is based on the theory that we learn a language by repetition and continuous exposure to a language or environment.  Theoretically this is true.  However, each person learns in a different combination of ways based on his/her previous experiences and therefore the way in which we learn develops as we age.  How effective any program is, boils down to whether the method of teaching matches that individual's method of learning.\n\nThis product contains a number of CD s for listening to role-play conversations and role-play games in Spanish on a specific subject, say buying a T-Shirt.  In this script you will be exposed to words for size, colors, numbers and basic phrase such as \"I would like___\", \"Could you please give me___\"\n\nThis product also contains a DVD which is essentially a number of photo-flashcards for word association.  This is only slightly more helpful than the CD s because you can see a video of a man and a woman taking turns speaking the language and you can mimic the way their mouths move in order to refine your pronunciation.\n\nIn comparison to the Rosetta Stone this product is not as in-depth, comprehensive or as organized.  It is basically a  \"light\" \"try me\" mini version of the Rosetta Stone.  At this price, it is a good introductory program for both the learning method as well as Spanish vocabulary.  It does not contain as much grammar or sentence building knowledge as the Rosetta Stone series or the Pimsleur series.  It resembles a phrasebook set to CD.\n\nAs both a Pro and a Con of this type of product: expect the Spanish version to be similar to the Italian version, the French version, the Japanese version etc.  Works well if you thrive with this learning method but is bad for those that are  bored easily.\n\nRecommended if\n1) You always wanted to try the Rosetta Stone style of learning but are not sure you want to spend that much $ yet.\n2) You are quite certain that flashcard style learning or audio role-playing works well for you and just want to experience the Spanish language.\n3) You want to learn Continental Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish.\n4) You want to have an Audio Phrasebook.", "label": 2}

My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.  You can get it activated again and give some excuse as to why it needs to be reactivated (at least, that's what the support person told me).

At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.\n\nSummary:\nThe Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.\n\nThe beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.\n\nApart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.\n\nProbably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.\n\n***\nThe games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.", "label": 2}

It is the most fun kids game I had ever played. I never ever got bored with it.\nIt's a challenging game, even though it's for 3rd Graders, I got it when I was about 11 and me and Mum struggled with it at times! Probably because it's American and their learning system is harder and different.\nI haven't played it for many years, about 3 or 4 because of this one reason.\n\nNow that we have 'newer' computers, even though they are about 6 or 7 years old, they will NOT support this game. It pops up with viruses, won't start or just crash. This is on other computers or laptops of ours too. I have the same problem with 4th and 5th Grade Adventures (these are also very good but far more challenging! And yes, I used to play them on my old OLD computer).\n\nI don't suggest buying this game unless you have a computer than can support old games, otherwise you will be horribly disappointed.

{"text": "The Complete National Geographic is a massive collection of every issue from 1888 - 2008.  That means 120 years of one of the world's most amazing magazines, all digitized and capable of being loaded onto your computer.\n\nThe nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some \"printing\" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material.\n\nThe bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents.  The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.

{"text": "OK, I've had XP loaded on my machine now for a few days.  So Far I really like it.  My PC does boot faster, and even though it takes some getting used to I think it is a better OS than the 9x versions.  This Operating System is definitely more stable and is also much more easy on the system resources.\nIf you are considering this software I would recomend it assuming you can get over the hurdles I am about to list.\nHere are the things I really don't like about this software:\n1. Almost nothing I need is compatible.  The Installation would not run unless I removed programs that had known compatibility issues, (ie. All of my antivirus and security software) Now that I have XP loaded I have two options.  I can go back to my Old OS and normalize everything. Or I can Shell out my life savings on new software that is \"XP Approved\" Even Office for XP requires an activation code.\n2. This OS is very expensive.  Once activated you can still upgrade your computer to some degree without having to reactivate. (by a new copy and activation code) But for this Price?  You've got to be kidding me! Software this expensive should give a user unlimited use allowing installation on as many machines as are in his or her household without extra cost.  Of Course some households qualify for a multi user discount, but from what I hear it's a pretty skimpy discount.\n3.  Good Wizards and Bad Wizards.  Yes, like a good Tolkein novel there are Good Wizards and Bad Wizards, and MS typically has bad ones.  When you run the wizards they will do all the work for you, which is good for some people, But I want to know why some things are done the way they are done. The Windows XP Wizards make assumptions that they should not make.  If you really know what you are doing, it won't be too difficult to figure out why your network suddenly doesn't work when you enable the ICF (Internet Connection Firewall) feature.\nBasically this is going to be a very big money pit to any one who decides to upgrade.  In an understandable effort to prevent/thwart Piracy, the Software company has taken measures to make sure that everyone has to buy their own copy as well as the upgrades or newer versions of the most commonly used programs in those machines.\nAll in all I am not displeased with the new operating system, But I do not recommend it.  It offers flexibility on our desktops but is very inflexible as a continued expenditure. If you buy it you will Pay much more than what the Operating system itself cost.\nGood luck in your endeavors!", "label": 0}
{"text": "This was a tough one.  I saw all the awful reviews and wondered, should I even bother with this product?  So I bought it, and a few days later I'm still not sure I like it, but it is functional.  I find myself using both the new and the old side by side.  SA 2003 is both good and bad.\nPluses:\nThe map data is better.  However, it's not perfect.  Even the latest data Delorme has still isn't up to where local street maps are.  However, there is a \"fix.\"  This version of Street Atlas allows you to add the roads.  (It's not hard with a GPS log to generate a fairly accurate representation of the road.)  So you can fill in the gaps with a little driving around.\nThe addition of points of interest, restaurants, hospitals, and radio stations directly to the map is neat.  The data is mostly accurate and somewhat helpful even if only moderately complete.\nThere is a lot more functionality in SA 2003.  You can have multiple routes, multiple layers of draw objects, multiple waypoint files, (all at once) and it makes usage rather complicated.  It's almost like AutoCAD in the layers respect.  It's going to send many users into overload - almost guaranteed.  If you liked the overall simplicity of the previous versions, you're going to hate this one.  There should probably be an hour DVD showing how to make best use to the program included in the packaging.\nThere are a lot of search options.  The ability to find places within a window, city, by name, zip code, lat/lon, etc. is great.  Unfortunately, the options combined with the \"new\" interface makes it a little too cumbersome for most people.\nReliability is good. It hasn't crashed yet.\nMinuses:\nThe interface is awful.  (I'm still on the fence as to how awful it is.  Half of me hates it and the other half is starting to tolerate it.)  It's non-standard and somewhat non-intuitive.  You should read all the help files TWICE before realistically trying to use the program, especially if you've used a previous version of Street Atlas.  Whoever wrote the UI forgot the cardinal rule of Windows programming, a familiar interface improves the user experience.\nI've read the reviews about it being slow.  It's not as fast as previous versions, but it's far from being arduously slow.  Be sure to copy the data files to the hard drive.  (Stick Data CD in and run setup from that CD.)  It improves speed.  The killer is the GPS.  Do not turn on the GPS for tracking or real time locating unless you're not doing anything else with the computer - my 1.2 Ghz Athlon w/ 512 MB of RAM was maxxed out (100% CPU utilization) trying this task.  (Unclick every check box in the GPS Options dialog area.)  You will likely be disappointed if this is your primary mapping program in your car if nothing else, due to the excess CPU utilization, it may feel very sluggish.  However, in normal home usage, locating places and scrolling through maps without GPS, CPU usage rarely topped 50% and usually stayed below 10%.  Once you have a route and everything else setup where you won't be interacting with the computer, then you can initialize and run the GPS and not be too annoyed.  (Just don't try to make changes at this point.)  I'm not exactly sure why this occurs, but careful use of accepting GPS data seems to solve most problems.\nI did not test the microphone portion where you can ask it where you are.  So I cannot \"speak\" to how well that works.\nVerdict: The program has an awful, \"new\" interface, good information with lots of flexibility, and is fine speed-wise as long as you're not using it for real-time mapping with a GPS while typing a letter.  And if you're a technophobe - you're going to hate it because it's non-standard and there will be somewhat of a learning curve.  If you're planning to be sitting in your car with your laptop and GPS, you may be happier with something less CPU intensive and simpler, like an older version of Street Atlas.  However, if you're the adventuresome type whose not afraid of screwy non-standard interfaces - check out SA 2003.  It offers a lot.", "label": 2}

{"text": "FrontPage 2000 is, like much of Microsoft Office 2000, very little improvement over its predecessors.\nI eat, breath and sleep Web design and site management. Since 1994 I have searched high and low for a Web page  editor that would provide the same kind of control and ease-of-use that I  had come to expect from page layout programs like Quark XPress and  PageMaker. I tried them all: PageMill, NetObjects Fusion, AOLPress, and  then FrontPage. While better than what had come before, FrontPage has  always had one overwhelming shortcoming: it is inexorably linked to other  Microsoft software, particularly the IIS Web server and Internet  Explorer.\nI am not a Microsoft-hater; I use IE5 everyday and think it to  be a very good browser. And I used FP98 for a number of sites in the past.  However, the many problems raised by other reviewers are legitimate\n-  HTML \"Correction\" - All versions of FP give the author access to  the underlying HTML code, but not complete control over it. If there was  only one right way to do something in HTML, that wouldn't be a problem, but  with three or four ways to centre something, how can FP know which one is  correct? An HTML editor should give the user complete control over all  code. Pointing out errors is fine, but correcting them without asking is  not.\n- Server-side extensions - While FP offers some cool stuff like a  guestbook, what isn't made clear to the novice user is that you will need  to have FrontPage extensions installed on your hosting server in order for  the gizmos to work. A lot of ISPs don't want to do this, which is  understandable when CGI scripts can accomplish the same functions with less  hassles.\n- Bad HTML Code - Like most Web editors that have come before  it, FP2K produces bloated HTML.\n- IE-specific JavaScript and DHTML - The  first time I tried to slam out a page in FP2K, this problem bit me.  JavaScript is a problematic thing: different Web browsers interpret it  differently. It is important to use code that will be understood equally  well by IE and Netscape. With FP2K, forget it. Some JavaScript and DHTML  effects are cross-browser, but many are not, and the interface doesn't tell  us which is which.\nFrontPage 2000 is not a professional Web designer's  tool. For them, there is Macromedia Dreamweaver, and text editors like  Allaire Homesite and HotMetal. And FP2K isn't a tool for people just  starting out, because they won't know how limiting the software really is  until it is too late. For them, I recommend a good free WYSIWYG editor such  as Netscape Composer or Namo WebEditor, and some books on HTML.\nThe  bottom line? Take a serious look around before purchasing FrontPage 2000.", "label": 0}

It is true that if you cut the software loose to generate all of the Microsoft exension code that the result is not very compatible with many ISP servers, e.g. AOL. If you just disable all of the options (in the compatibility area of page options)and use Frontpage to generate the rough HTML for a page layout it does save time and effort, like avoiding all of the table layout grunt work. You will have to have some HTML coding and enough Internet/website construction knowledge to be able to fly by the seat of your pants, as it were, and actually get the website up to your internet server and make it function (the latter is mainly a matter of keeping an eye on the way the web page files are generated, so you don't end up with unnecessary folders within folders and generally server-annoying voluminous subfile references--if you keep it simple and just generate your own htm/html files (i.e., don't let Frontpage run wild with its own maze of folders and subfolders and machine-made spaghetti code) and upload them yourself to your webserver (keeping an eye on the url/relative file link information for your pages) it is a pretty nice tool for about half of the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX Fireworks product (which admittedly I would rather have if I had $300 bucks to spare).", "label": 2}

You have to get used to all the different ways Red Hat refers to tasks etc. such as icons are called \"emblems.\"\nI opened the browser, Mozilla 1.0, and it worked fine except when I went to download Opera for Linux, I was faced with a dozen cryptic flavors that I don' know about.  So I tried one for Red Hat and the install failed.  Then I tried to connect to the local Windows NT4 network, and it was so cryptic and hard to find networking that I gave up.  They recommend downloading a program called Samba, to connect to Windows, but if this function isn't built into Red Hat by default, they're going to lose potential customers.  It should be very easy to connect to a Windows network, because, like it or not, that's the real world for now.  Open Office Org seems okay, it's great to have a non Microsoft alternative!\nI have wanted an alternative to Microsoft for a long time.  If Red Hat adds Windows Network and Print services I think it'll have a winner.  Worth the small investment if you use it at home.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I have had mixed feelings about the Norton Utilities for years. On one hand it gives you some improved tools, over those provided with windows (disk defragmentation, scan disk, registry editor, etc.). On the other hand, my experience has been that the utilities are sometimes the source of the problem rather than the fix and there is deffinitely some damage done from \"overengineering\" your PC with the tools. I wouldn't recommend them for inexperienced users - Norton has made them really easy to use but they can really do some damage if you click the wrong button. More experienced users usually use a single utility out of the package anyway (I only use it for the registry editor).", "label": 2}

{"text": "OK, so here is my story.\nI am quite good with computers and especially good at figuring out programs.  I read some reviews of several programs and have currently tried Pinnacle, WinDVD, PowerDirector, and ULead Videostudio.  I have to say, Pinnacle was the best.  However, it sucks.\nLet me explain.\nWhereas ULead and PowerDirector had all kinds of neat clean-up features, the simple task of inserting transitions on a black background was not so simple.  In fact, it was a pain for both.  I couldn't figure out how to create menus or chapters with either of these programs.  Bottom line:  all the video clean-up abilities of a program can't beat out a programs efficiency.  And these two programs, although nice, run well, and easy to figure out; lacked the ability to create menus, chapters, and easy transitions.  So they suck.\nOh, and WinDVD just....really really sucks.  I'm not even going to talk about it.\nPinnacle on the other hand, was magnificent.  Change volume, create beautiful transitions, and import music with a few clicks.  So simple to use and it could create fantastic menus with chapters; it was magnificent.  However, it too sucks.  Why?  Because it's VERY VERY VERY resource demanding.  It will suck your memory and processor dry.  I have a 512 MB, Pentium 4 2.7 GHz processor.  Still, the program crawled.  I'm not talking about rendering now....that is normal for it to take a day or night depending on your computer (mine rendering for a 1 hour 40 minute video with 6 menus took ~4-6 hours.)\nNo, this program CRAWLS!  Try to do anything, and you'll wait 5 minutes for its completion (after you've got your video over an hour that is).  Now, I didn't do what the other reviewer had mentioned to overcome this by breaking it up, which isn't a bad idea.  Unfortunately, to make your chapters, you have to put it all together anyway.\nSo I made my DVD, I then wanted to make some changes.  Well, it started crawling.  And mind you, it had locked up on me ~20 times.  So I started saving often.  Well, it locked up on me while saving.  Yah....you got it, after spending 2 weeks on a two hour video...I lost EVERYTHING.  So needless to say, I hate this program.\nWhy the 3 Stars?  As you can see, I can't find any program that even comes close to the handiness or usefulness of this one.  I am now trying Sony Vegas Studio.  I will let you know what I discover.\nLater,\n\nUPDATE:\nI tried Sony Vegas Studio and it was terrible.  I decided to spend the money on Powerdirector and Powerproducer.  It's ease of operation was too good to pass up.  Maybe if I get a faster computer one of these days, I'll give the Pinnacle another try.  However, I am still to p.o.'d about losing my entire movie.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Publisher 2002 is a perfect example when new doesn't mean better. This version took out an essential ability of Publisher 2000 to create web sites consisting of several pages.  Publisher 2000 was a dream for web publishing. What made it valuable over freeware such as Netscape Composer, is that you could create a large web site of multiple pages, and while as a document you could easily name each page with its own file extension.\nThis function is critical for a business web site. It is vital to have each web page named with its own professional-appearing extension, beginning with index.html, and not page001.html, page002.html, which is a big red flag of a home-made web site using a WYSIWYG program.\nI bought the 2002 expecting the same critical feature that would let me maintain my 5 web businesses and create my 4 new web businesses with ease. You see Composer only lets you create 1 web page at a time, which is very tedious if your web site contains 40-150 pages. It was worth paying [price] for Publisher 2000 that let me create and edit large web sites, jump easily while creating from page to page, edit pages, transpose images  from one to another, etcetera.\nThen, when it was time to publish, I made certain to name each page while still in web document form, with an appropriate, professional-appearing .html extension. I could do this easily page-by-page, by going to Page Properties in the File category, and typing in the file name extension for each page. Then, when I converted the collective web document in Pub 2000, each html  page would appear with my prenamed file extension. So my pages would appear as.mybiz.com/index.html, .mybiz.com/products1.html, etcetera.\nWell you can imagine I was aghast to see the super critical feature to name each page with its own file extension in a large document, missing from Publisher 2002!!!!!!! This means that if I create 20 pages in 1 document as a web site, I can only name the first page with a professional business name of index.html. The rest of the pages are named starting with the number 01.html and so on numerically!!!! This is totally unacceptable for a web business site as this tags the site as an amateur creation.\nAnother huge flaw because this ONE vital feature is missing is, if I create 10 separate web pages, one at a time in Publisher 2002, these pages will be worthless linked together in the same directory. Say I publish onto the web 10 linked pages into a directory called /sales. The problem is Publisher names each photo on each of those pages starting with the number 0.\nSo if I have 10 pages linked together, created one by one in Publisher, it will be a fiasco if they are in the same directory, because there will be TEN pictures all named 0.jpg and what will publish is a garbled confusion.\nAt least in Composer it keeps the names of each photo you import as it was originally, such as butterfly.jpg, avoiding that confusion. But if this same butterfly picture is imported into Publisher 2002, it is renamed 0.jpg. So if I have 3 pages I made in Publisher each of a different image on it, it won't matter, because each of those 3 pictures will be renamed 0.jpg, making it impossible to put any 2 or more pages created in Publisher 2002 in the same directory. So being told by Microsoft to just create one page at a time and link them together, doesn't cut it.\nAll this can be solved by returning the cricitical option to type in your own file extension on each page as Publisher 2000 allowed. I am vastly disappointed with Publisher 2002 because it is virtually worthless for any professional web business use that exceeds 1 web page. This lumps it in the same category as Composer, only Composer is better because you can truly link individual pages together, since each .jpg retains its own individual, identifying name. On top of that why would someone pay [price] for a program with less than the options they can get for free?\nThis is the first time I have every uninstalled a new program and reinstalled the older version, but it's the only way I can continue to work on my large web sites.\nOn top of that you don't get free tech support with 2002, if it isn't related to installing.  I had to pay [price] for the technician to tell me that 2002 has lost that feature.  In fact, it was the technician who urged me to complain about this---he thought it was terrible, too....\n>Hey, for regular, non-related publishing, 2002 is great.  It's just worthless for web site creating.  I'm still shocked and surprised about this, 'cause I never thought Microsoft would strip this powerful program of its ability to make web sites.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have used Norton products for the past few years and have been very satisfied.  It is for this reason that I decided to stay with Norton when I updated my utilities suite.  Shortly after installing SystemWorks 2004, I started having problems with my computer.  The time it took for my computer to boot up seemed to double.  I received several error messages regarding Windows and, finally, Windows wouldn't start at all.  I had to re-install my operating system (Windows XP).  I had problems printing, programs would hang, CDs and DVDs wouldn't run correctly, and the music I had downloaded to my computer several months ago wouldn't play properly.  There is nothing wrong with my computer; it's not even a year old yet and it is a powerful system.  I had everything checked on it just to be sure and the computer itself is fine.\nIt took a while to figure it out but Norton Antivirus seems to be the culprit.  No matter what settings I use, the computer will not operate properly as long as Norton Antivirus is enabled.  I have finally got to the point where I can go online and work on one or two documents with the antivirus enabled, but usually I have to disable it for the computer to work as it should.  Playing CDs or DVDs, or listening to music is not possible with the antivirus enabled.  Of course, with Norton disabled, that means I can't go online; that just wouldn't be safe.  So, I have to completely disconnect (remove the plug from the computer itself) from the Internet and then disable Norton for everything to run smoothly.\nI'm not a computer whiz so I don't know exactly what the problem is but I have learned to work around it.  I thought about switching to McAfee but I truly don't believe McAfee is as good a product as Norton.  Norton Utilities works like a charm when it comes to finding and fixing system and disk problems.  Norton Cleansweep is great at removing unneeded files.  I access the internet through my cable service so I don't need Connection Keep Alive which prevents dropped dial-up connections.  As for Password Manager, I don't keep any personal, confidential  information on my computer, not even passwords.  Nothing is foolproof so if a hacker does manage to get to my computer, he won't find anything interesting.  And even though Norton Antivirus is giving me problems, I still think it is a great tool at finding and removing threats from your PC.\nI'm hoping that Norton will be able to work out the glitches with SystemWorks 2004 and that everything will be back on track for SystemWorks 2005.

In the beginning of the game, you must pick a catz for yourself from the kennel. You can then name it, and it will be yours to keep on your desktop. There are several different backgrounds where your catz can live, and each has its own special features. On the Snow background, you can make and throw snowballs at catz, and on the house background your catz will chase mice that run from hole to hole.\n  It can be interesting to see how each pet will react to different toys. You can put all the toys/tools on your shelf at somepoint during the game, and you can always change with other items you may find. They can be catnip, overwhich catz will go crazy, or pillows, which are good for sleeping on.\n  You can breed your catz together and make new catz.  That can be fun for a while, but the generations are not always the same as they would be in real life. An added feature is voice recognition, which can be fun if you have a good mic.

{"text": "Daria's Inferno, much like Star Trek: Borg before it, lives up to Simon and Shuster Interactive's apparent credo of: \"Give them an easy, interactive episode to entertain them once or twice\". If you missed Borg, it involved about 2 hours of playing time that could be watched as a ~40 minute \"movie\" when you were  finished. Here, this is compressed for the MTV generation as about 1 hour of playing time for ~20 minutes of actual material. Guess they didn't want to worry about the second CD.\nGraphics in the game are about what you'd expect from a 2D animation heroine - although the backgrounds in the \"cut scenes\" noticably lack detail, and the repetitive reuse of Trent for level transitions gets annoying. There's only about 20 minutes of material on this CD, couldn't they at least put a change in there?\nGameplay is, well.... insulting to Daria fans. This CD is marked as rated for teenagers 13+. Most Daria fans I've seen on the net are between 15 and 45 (I'm almost 30). The mindset needed for this game to be an actual puzzle would be about 5, however. Every object in the game has a use, but there are only about  30 total objects, almost all of which you literally CAN NOT miss. If their use weren't extremely obvious already (what would you try to do first with a garage door opener with a garage nearby, for example?) - the Sick Sad World segments spell it completely out for you. Kevin Thompson could beat this game in a day.\nI must admit that there is one challenge however -- not getting so irritated at the interface that you use the CD as a frisbee. Movement of Daria is controlled with either the keyboard arrow keys (with _no_ use of diagonals on the keypad) or the mouse. Unfortunately, application of items on \"irritants\" aka enemies is _also_ with the same mouse button. Miss by a pixel and you walk straight into what you were trying to negate. I guess this was needed for the Mac port (I know 2+ button mice for Macs _exist_ but they are an option, after all...).\nSetting aside the above -- is it worth it? Well, if you have a child of 5 or 6, sure. It's a fun little game. Otherwise,  you _must_ be a fan of the show to enjoy this game. A rabid fan, possibly. There are gems for the fans, including an extended version of the show's theme \"You're Standing on my Neck\" by Splendora in the credits. Daria's comments throughout the game are also amusing, as is the storyline. As dream sequence\nepisodes go, I'd rather have seen this plot than \"Depth Takes  a Holiday\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "Three things your readers might want to know: 1) There is no free online technical support ($10 per report sent is available) 2) You have one free call to tech support (then it is $20) 3) Updating the software is not through downloads from the website. The website lists that an SP1 is available for Omnipage Pro 14, but it can only be accessed through the help/webupdate feature in the program. Unfortunately the webudate doesn't work and though I have reported the bug twice, I got no communication from Sansoft and no information in their online \"knowledge base\" on how to solve this problem. Since I am in Europe, I haven't called their tech support, and in fact I am more than irritated that such a complicated method of software updates exists. When other software companies offer auto updates through the program (such as Microsoft Windows, Office, etc.) they also let you download directly when the auto method doesn't work or isn't convenient. I think your readers need to know the mindset of Sansoft before they buy a product that may be expensive and inconvenient to maintain.", "label": 2}

The biggest grip I have is the fact that on every page there's advertisments for MS partners or MSN etc. If that's not bad enough, everytime you update Money from the Internet you get these nice icons placed on your desktop for Ameritrade and such.. Delete them and next time you update there back. If MS wants to sale ad space by placing ads on it's products and forcing users to live with their desktop setting the way MS wants it to be, then the product should be free.. Kinda like those \"Free\" Internet service providers... But then again, MS tends to force it's users to live with a lot. Secondly, if your like me (pay check to pay check) knowing what bills lie between those pay checks is a must. In Money 2000 this was a sinch, just glance at the detailed view and your set, in 2002 it's a lot harder. You still get the detailed view, but it's a slimmer \"simpler\" view, you do get the nifty calander at the bottom, so to view what falls between different paydays, you have to click on each of the bolded days and scratch down the bills on a piece of paper. My overall suggestion, if your using an older release, stick with it. 2002 Upgrade is a waste of money.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Apple's tendency to fleece its user base is becoming more prevalent this fiscal year. Perhaps it has to do with the downturn in the economy or the lackluster computer sales, both Mac and Intel based. With that aside, it's hard to swallow paying this much for an upgrade, yes, an upgrade, when you've doled out just as much for version 10.1. They aren't offering existing 10.1 users any discounts unless you bought 10.1 after July 17 or a computer. With that said, 10.2 is an astounding leap forward in speed. But that's pretty much it. This is the speed bump we've been promised for ages, and now we have to pay for it, and pay for it dearly.\nThey've come out with a suite of apps that you may or may not use, and seem to be taking the Microsoft route of bundling lots of so-so apps into the operating system. So if you like AOL, you're in luck, because iChat integrates AIM and AOL users with mac.com users. Yawn. For OSX, you can download Fire, Proteus, AIM, and a host of other apps that do exactly what iChat does, only better. Inkwell is another technology that only a few will find useful, as well as many of their new features.\nThe other day I had to start up in OS9 (to use iDVD because the OSX version was mucking up the sound levels), and even though it felt like I was doing something dirty, I was amazed and discomfited by the speed. I'd been using OS X for so long that I forgot just how zippy OS9 really is (but then again, it doesn't have all that eye-candy). Even 10.2 isn't as fast as it's now-buried counterpart, OS9.\nThe other thing I truly don't understand is the lack of interface conformance in Apple's own apps. You launch Mail, and it's Aqua. You click on the Address book, and it's brushed metal. iTunes is brushed metal, iMovie is in it's own world (you can't even get to the desktop or minimize it in anyway), iPhoto is a combination of brushed metal and Aqua, and iDvd is Aqua. I'm still trying to figure out which way Apple is going with a theme, because its in-house software developers are clearly \"doing\" there own thing when it comes to interfacing with the user. At least other developers, including Micro$oft, are keeping things consistent. I wish Apple would.\nI would also like to see  more concentration on the core services such as the open and save dialogs (still pretty bad), and other features we've grown to love in the past but were swept away in OS X (tabbed folders, application switcher that was detachable, etc...). So, five stars for a suberb upgrade, minus one star for the no-tiered upgrade pricing, and minus one star for focusing on features we haven't been asking for and giving us features no one is banging at Apple's doors to give us. On the plus side, the OS is absolutely wonderful in terms of  NOT trying to get you to buy, sign-up, join, or steer you in any way toward Apple-branded products. That is so refreshing.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Windows 2000 is a waste of money. If you plan on getting a new OS then Linux is the one to get. First off all, it's FREE, and much more customizable/flexible.  And I must say this again, it's FREE for download. Linux can support multiple users, unlike Windows, one person can be the  administrator, the other a user, and restrictions can be put on folders and  apps.  You can download different interfaces if you get bored of the first  one.  You can customize interfaces too, you can make a button look 3D or 2D  and stuff like that.  There are many different distributions of Linux,  Corel, Redhat, Mandrake, there's a big selection somewhere in Amazon.  Corel is a good one for beginners because of it's graphical installation  and is easily availible for download from Corel.  To obtain a  distribution of Linux, you can either buy a boxed package for around $30-60  or just download it for free... around 250-300 MB depending on the  distribution.  Also, when you get Windows 2000 you'll be wasting 200  Dollars, and then to get MORE software you'll have to spend even MORE  money.  Linux software is absolutely free.  If you get the boxed package  you get most of the software you need: Netscape Communicator, organizer,  calendar, office utilities etc.  So, Either you can waste 200 dollars on  Windows 2000 and get stuck with the same old thing, or you can download and  wait around 7 hours for something even better.", "label": 0}

Version 12 seems like a step in the right direction as it radically changed the GUI and allowed the adoption of Illustrator concepts. Let's hope Corel gets the message and continues the improvements.\n\nI must admit that V12 at least makes a good attempt to revive the efficacy of Designer V8. For the most part, the filter export and import translators work reasonably well. Corel FINALLY decided to give us a 3-point parabolic stretch tool in V12.

{"text": "I have been one of the advocates of using Roxio over Nero for quite a while now.  I have used Easy CD Creator to burn hundreds of music and data discs over the years, but this is the version where I may have to switch.  This review is for avid users of EZCD Creator versions 4, 5, and 6, which I believe are all better than 7.  Don't get me wrong.  DVD Builder, VideoWave, and the new PhotoSuite 7 are both definite improvements, as are the capture and storyboard features. However, I would like to focus on the degraded \"Creator Classic\" and the nearly unrecognizable Label Creator, which I use the most and have come to rely on.  Instead of a general complaint, I will give examples.  Here are some of the best features that have been screwed up in version 7:\n1. You can no longer right-click on the column attributes above the song titles.  You are limited to Size, Type and Date Modified.  In Creator Classic 6, you had could display the bit rate, duration of a song, track number, album name, etc., etc.\n2. Although you can still preview a song, it is a tiny little box with very limited features.  You can no longer play several previews from the same player like you could in versions 4-6...another downgrade.\n3. I have also noticed that this version is much fussier with MP3 files.  Nearly any bit rate would play in version 6.  This one is hit and miss.  A song that plays in your media player may come out with pops and defects after it is burned to CD.\n4. If you have an MP3 file with both the artist and song title, the artist name is dropped from the playlist.  Kind of inconvient if you are making a compilation disc.\n5. If you decide to save your project and burn the disc later, good luck.  The artist title will be automatically deleted from the Artist field, the Disc Title will also be deleted, and the playlist may or may not be shuffled and song titles may be substitued for others.  Sounds like a major bug to me.  This happened more than once to me.  Another problem not found in previous versions.\n6. If you drag and drop more than one song title to a different location on your playlist, there's a pretty good chance that the program will shut down completely, and you can then start over again.\nNow, on to Label Creator.\n1. You now have options.  Too too many options.  Why should you have to CHOOSE whether you want the artist, track list and media type, as well as decide which of the 12 different options you want on the label?  Isn't that overkill?  What was wrong with the basic clicking of the \"CD Contents\" button and have it automatically display the track list?\n2. There is also the issue already mentioned by another reviewer of the label creator not allowing you to drag tracks line by line.  The playlist is now in a block.  You can't stretch song titles like you could in previous versions, and the songs will not display alpha-numerically.\n3. Last, how about a wizard to help you decide which of the 8 different layout options you want.  What was wrong with the basic front, back and insert?  Believe me, when it comes to labels, less is more.\nWell, that's my 10 cents about Roxio's new bloated bundle.", "label": 2}

I was expecting Glo to be one step above Ilumina, and in a  sense it is, but another sense it is not.\n\nGlo is better than Ilumina in the sense that you can go to a chapter and verse in quick easy steps, and you can open multiple sessions of the Bible (and other lenses for that matter) at the same time.  Also, Glo lets you select a passage in the Bible and drop it to all of the lenses to see if anything in the passage is connected to the atlas, media, etc.\n\nWhat is lacking in Glo that is in Ilumina are the HD animations, guided tours, and the Bible Encyclopedia.  Glo does have an encyclopedia based from Zondervan's Pictorial Encyclopedia, but it is only for some and not all articles whereas Ilumina has the entire Encyclopedia available.\n\nIn summary, for those who have Ilumina and not sure if Glo is worth it, for $35 Glo can be a perfect companion of Ilumina.", "label": 1}

My hope is, after a few months, the various bug patches will be available to insure that when I get the package I can avoid the majority of headaches that come with it.  So I waited until now to upgrade to Windows XP.  The setup seemed very impressive as it offer a pain-free upgrade from previous versions of Windows, which assured me that the program menu, desktop items and other personal data would be safely maintained during the upgrade.  After the 90 minute upgrade process completed, all of these assurances turned out not to be true.  Further, Microsoft's support for Windows XP was next to nil.  While they had a phone number I could call for support, the people didn't seem to have a clue as to what to do with installation issues such as I had, further, I was placed on hold for long period of time as long distance charges accrued, while they touched base with other people who might know.  Those people were apparently never found as I cumulatively spent up to 5 hours between brief assurances that they were still looking into it.  Finally, I had to do the system footwork myself to find and restore many of my original programs, desktop items, start menu setting, corrupted registry entries, and email accounts/data; all of which had been misplaced by the install, though fortunately not deleted.  The Windows XP upgrade also left me immediately infected with an internet worm which I had to scan for and get cleaned up.  The only reason why I've not given the software 1 star is because once I fixed all of these problems with over ten hours of personal time, Windows XP now seems to be running pretty well.

I liked all the features ME borrowed from 2000, such as the customizable start menu.  Then I found out that ME removed native DOS mode support and most of my pre-1998 games no longer worked.

More customizability\n3. Much bigger driver database (at the expense of HD space)\nDrawbacks of Windows ME:\n1. Higher system requirements\n2. Incompatibility with some ISPs (AOL, some broadband providers)\n3. Integrated features like IE 5 and WMP 7 are impossible to remove, so I hope you like them :(\n4.

{"text": "WARNING\nIf you try and load Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum edition on a computer (running Windows 2000 professional and boots from a SCSI hard drive using an Adaptec Controller card) put your (money) back into your pocket and step away from the product.\nHere is my horror story. I had been running Easy CD creator 4.0 and was interested in version 5.0 for some features that would help me in transferring my old LP collection to CD. I tried to get an update, but I guess the fact that I had 4.0 registered on line was not sufficient to qualify. The ongoing emails were not worth the cost savings, so I decided just to shell out the (money) and get a full retail version. Since Version 4.0 was purchased when it was part of Adaptec (and now is was Roxio), I guess computer registration information doesn't translate between companies.\nOn Saturday I was in (a local store) and decided to purchase the full version. It would have been less painful for me to just burn the (money) instead of going through the events of the following week. I want to point out the packaging clearly states this product works with Windows 2000. The only disclaimer is that it won't work on Windows 2000 server.  I went to upgrade from version 4.0 to version 5.0. Most well written software, from the same vendor, knows how to handle an upgrade from one version to another. Not in this case, after the reboot the screen put up an error message stating no supportable CD/RW device was detected. After further investigation, the event log reported errors that DCOM could not find specified file. I then read the installation instructions that said to uninstall version 4.0 first. With that information I knew I needed to uninstall version 5.0. First it told me it could not uninstall because it did not have rights to delete a registry key that the installation process created. I had to go into the registry to change the rights on the KEY so I could manually delete it. Now, I could complete uninstalling version 5.0. Then I removed version 4.0 with out any problems. I rebooted the computer and tried to install Version 5.0 and  got the same results it did not work.\nI then visited Roxio's WEB site and downloaded the patches that were posted. I uninstalled version 5.0 and had the same rights issue with the registry. Now I tried to install version 5.0 using the instructions from the WEB. The instructions say to apply both patches before doing the reboot of the computer. The first patch loaded fine. The update patch said no valid version of Roxio product was detected on this machine or something to that effect. I rebooted thinking maybe the registry needed to be refreshed and tried to load the update and got the same error message.\nI am now into Sunday with this problem. I decided that since the computer has been running for over a year with no major problems that maybe the registry has some corruption. So, I reload the Windows 2000 operating system. Same result as before, version 5.0 still does not load correctly.\nNow my weekend is gone, and I am at work Monday morning. I decide to call Roxio's tech support line. The line is not toll free. I was on hold for one hour before a technician came onto the line. I tell him the problem and the configuration of my computer. He tells me he has heard of this before, and said the fix is to uninstall the Adaptec SCSI card and load the software. He also says that I need to go into the registry and delete any key that makes reference to Adaptec. This sent shivers down my spine!\nMy problem is I have no IDE drive and boot from the SCSI subsystem. At the technician's suggestion, I removed the Adaptec drivers replaced, them with the generic drivers, hacked the registry, and loaded version 5.0. I rebooted the computer and got the same error messages. Now I have a new problem. The computer detects the Adaptec card and wants to load the appropriate drivers. So, I do. Every time I reboot the computer it detects the Adaptec controller and wants to load the drives. This obviously was a result of hacking at the registry. To fix this problem, I had to reload Windows 2000.\nMonday night I decided to go to Roxio's WEB site and post the problem on line. I can't afford an hour of long distant charges to their tech support. I recap the problems and ask for a document that would allow me to take this product back to (the store) and get my money back. (The store) will not take back software they will only exchange software with bad media for same software.) This is not bad media, just bad programming. Wednesday I get e-mail from tech support suggesting something else to try. There is no mention of me getting my money back.  I try the suggestions, same results. I went back to the WEB site, posted the results. It's been almost a week now and all I have for my (money) is a shiny box the software came in, an hour of long distant phone charges and an unstable computer from trying to load Easy CD Creator 5.0. I have a feeling, the ploy at this point, is to keep running suggestions to me until the free support runs out so they can charge me more money. I am not that stupid Roxio.\nSave yourself and stay far, far, far, far away from Easy CD Creator 5.0. At this point I will not even install Easy CD creator 4.0. I am researching other CD burning software solutions.\nRick Shope", "label": 0}

{"text": "I switched to Ubuntu Linux after wrestling for months with a failing Windows installation.  I was pretty sure my hardware had gone bad and loaded Linux only as a last gasp attempt to find out what was wrong.  To my surprise, I never had another failure.  Something had become corrupted in my Windows XP software.  I might have been able to recover XP by formatting the disk and redoing Windows from scratch, but the prospect was pretty demoralizing.\n\nNow having said that, I don't want to mislead people into thinking that Linux will run without problems.  It might.  It might not.  How successful you are will depend to a considerable degree on the various devices you have - video card, sound card, WiFi network card, scanner, printer, etc.  Many devices will work out of the box.  Some will work if you go through the effort of finding and installing drivers for them.  Some may even work better than with Windows.  My Linux desktop and XP laptop will talk to each other fine, but my wife's Vista machine has trouble with both of the others.  Mileage varies.\n\nIf you switch to Linux from Windows, be prepared to learn some new things.  The OS is not harder to use.  In a great many ways, it presents the very same interface as Windows.  You'll see three little boxes in the upper right corner of each window that work the same as Windows.  You'll be able to use Alt-Tab to switch windows.  Control-C, X, and V will work the same in many applications.  The mouse works the same.  Firefox, Thunderbird, Open Office, and quite a few other applications will look and work the same as they do on Windows and, for most users, are just as good as the corresponding Microsoft software.\n\nBut you still must be prepared to learn some new things.  The more you do, the more you'll find that you can do with Linux, including some nice things that aren't in Windows.  If you feel awkward the first week, but are willing to learn a little, you'll be pretty comfortable by the second week and right at home after that.\n\nAs others have said, a big advantage of Linux is that it's free.  This isn't just a benefit for initial cost.  It also means you can upgrade your OS, your office suite, your picture viewers and editors, and most other stuff at no cost when the new versions come out.\n\nIt also means that you don't see the same quantity of nagware, crippleware, spyware, adware, spambots and viruses that you see on Windows.  And if you ever run into problems, you're free to switch to a newer or a different distribution without paying anyone a fee.\n\nI loaded Ubuntu 8.04 and was happy with it.  When 8.10 came out I upgraded and was happier still.  As of this writing, I'm now on 9.04 and it all keeps getting better.  So far it all runs fine on my now five year old machine.\n\n--- Later ---\nI've upgraded to 9.10, then 10.4 64 bit on a new HP with AMD Athlon II with 4 CPUS.  It keeps improving.  I was concerned about whether the 64 bit OS would be safe, but it appears to be fine.  I won't be going back to Windows any time soon.\n\n--- Later ---\n2013-03-10\nMy main workstation is now on Xubuntu 12.4 and I've been experimenting with 12.10 in a virtual machine.  I switched from standard Ubuntu to Xubuntu when the \"Unity\" desktop environment came out.  Xubuntu with its Xfce desktop seemed to me simpler, less glitzy, more to my taste.  The ability to switch desktops like this seems to me to be an advantage over Windows.  The underlying Linux operating system and pretty much all of the applications are the same for Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce and other desktop environments, but you can choose what style of menus, icons, taskbars, window frames, etc., you want and usually customize them quite a bit too.\n\nWindows still sets the standard for hardware manufacturers.  I was taken aback when my new Nexus 7 tablet used the Microsoft Media Transport protocol (MTP) for communication to a desktop computer and my Linux machine couldn't talk to it.  However I was able to find MTP drivers created by a smart open source programmer, install them, and get back in touch with my tablet.\n\nBut in spite of Microsoft's power over the manufacturers, things keep improving in the Linux world.  More and more hardware is supported.  When I bought an HP desktop with Windows 7 I was able shrink the Windows partition and install Ubuntu without a single hitch.  Everything just worked.  I kept about 10% of the disk for Win 7 on the theory that I might someday have to run some software that wouldn't run on Linux, but so far it hasn't happened.  The only times I boot up Win 7 are when I have to reboot Linux anyway and figure I might as well install the latest Microsoft patches while I'm doing it.\n\nI still haven't paid one dime for software since 2008 and yet I prefer my Linux system over the Windows system I use at work, loaded with Windows, Office, Visual Studio, virus checkers, and other commercial programs.\n\n--- Later ---\n2014-07-14\nNow running Xubuntu 14.04 and still happy with Ubuntu.\nThe interfaces to MTP devices like Android phones and tablets is now built in to the system.  I no longer need the self-installed drivers.\n\nI still recommend Linux.", "label": 1}

I seem to be learning from it anyway, so that's good, but I have to knock at least one star off purely for the presentation quality. You can't argue that this wouldn't be a more effective learning tool, especially with younger people, if it were visually up to date. The midi and wav audio is nothing to write home about either. If something like this were made today I'm sure it would use real instrument samples instead of midis.\n\nI also have an issue with the 'echo this rhythm' stuff. You're expected to repeat rhythms by syncing your mouse clicks or space bar taps, which is very awkward and difficult at times. I've tried for at least an hour to pass one particular section where you're required to repeat rhythms from 4 different instruments 2 or 3 times in a row without error - quite frustrating, and definitely not something my younger self would do willingly for more than 15 minutes (unless my parents had me on Ritalin or something).\n\nAll in all, it serves its purpose, but I wish I could have found a more modern piece of software, especially considering the price.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Yes, this is a fun game and the kids love to play. But, if you are actually looking to use this program to reinforce math skills, you should keep looking. In my opinion, and I actually played the entire game myself, this program is a long entertaining interactive adventure with a little math sprinkled in here and there. I, personally, was a little disappointed because the reviews and endorsements were so uniformly positive. For me, this is the bottom line: I try to limit my kids computer time. And, when they DO play the computer, I prefer to allow them to play games that have some kind of redeeming educational value. This makes Mia better for me, than, perhaps, some mindless shoot-em-up game. But, I still think that this game lacks enough educational content to feel good about letting them play for hours. And, I don't think the game is particularly useful for teaching or even reinforcing math skills. So, in my opinion, buy this as a GAME that you will let your kids play as a reward. As a game, it is a pretty good one. The story is entertaining for elementary age children, and the content is appropriate with absolutely nothing objectionable even for younger kids. But, don't expect any real math learning, and don't expect this to be a particularly useful tool if you are homeschooling math. So, in my opinion, buy this if you are looking for a fun game for your kids that also as a small amount of educational reinforcement.

I may be in for more than I bargained for.\n\nThe Good:  The installation is a breeze, and the GUI interface is beautiful to look at.  Configuring email and newsgroups is easy, but that's where it ends.\n\nThe Rest:  To really utilize this OS, prepare to read, and read, and read.  You may want to join a few Linux newsgroups, give up your social life for a few months if you really want to be good at it.  Even advanced features are pretty easy to learn in Windows just by playing around with them for a while, but not with Linux IMHO.  If you don't know any Linux commands or don't know quite what to say at a shell prompt, you're gonna be hurtin' for a while.\n\nAlso, when opening your web browser like Konqueror (KDE), or Mozilla Firefox (which I installed later) - don't expect to be able to navigate to your favorite site and play streaming audio or video like you would on a Windows box with WM or RP.

The learning is basic yet provides appropriate and seamless supporting materials (flash cards, workbook, story book). In my experience, sticker charts are popular and encouraging to this age group and the vocabulary pace (colors, numbers, shapes, etc.) is the perfect entre into encouraging the young student without frustrating them. My daughter was easily able to navigage the software, despite having had minimal exposure to computer games up until this point. The graphics were engaging and smooth, even on our nine year old Dell Dimension PC.\n\nThis set alone is NOT going to create a fluent speaker, obviously; the lessons are too basic. However, there are many, many excellent skills and lessons to be learned by just sitting down and completing one 15-minute lesson per day/week, etc. Not only are there benefits to learning to speak and think in another language and appreciate another culture, but the act of simply sitting down and seeing that learning can be fun has many benefits as well. Doing this on a regular basis also sets the stage for homework that begins in the first grade.\n\nThat said, it's like anything... it IS what you make of it. Not all children may be patient enough to sit down and be engaged by a task that seems \"educational.\" And not all adults are able or interested in using the supporting materials with their child.

This year the interface to Quicken is significantly upgraded and is a great improvement if you use both Quicken and TurboTax.  I have reservations about the new license process.  This year the software is registered to run on a single PC, and once registration has occurred, you must use the same PC to print your returns.  You can still load the software on another PC (such as your laptop) to work on tax calculations, but must return to the original PC to print your return.  This doesn't seem too bad, and apparently addresses a problem Intuit must have had in the past with lost sales (though dropping the price might make it easier to capture more sales).\nThe problem, as I see it, is when you want to reprint your return several years in the future.  If your original PC is no longer around, apparently you will never be able to print a copy of your return.  As I have had to get copies of returns from past years on occasion, I can see that this might be a significant problem.\nMy rating of three stars is an average.  For functionality, I rate the software 4+ stars, but for flexibility in printing, I rate it only 1 star, due to the restrictive license.  If this isn't corrected next year, I'll probably try TaxCut.", "label": 2}
{"text": "It works exactly as it is supposed to, but the sound quality is not that great.  Initially, the sound quality for the people I was calling was awful (although I heard them fine, my voice was garbled to them).  That was fixed by connecting the Internet Phone Wizard directly to my computers USB 2.0 port (as opposed to a hub or to a USB extension cable).  However, even once I did that, I still hear a lot more interference than I do if I use a headset on my PC.  The question is whether this product would work better on a newer, faster, PC.  I doubt it, but you never know.  I have a 4 or 5 yr old DELL Dimension 4400 running at 1.6GHz with 750 MBRam (WinXP).\n\nThe sound quality is poor enough, that for calls under 10 minutes I find myself opting to use the PC headset for better quality.  If I am going to be on the phone long distance for 30 minutes, I use this box so that I have the freedom to roam around the house on my cordless phone, even if the voice quality does suffer.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Untill now i couldn't find web publishing program that give you clean html code. I used frontpage 98 for more than 1 year and i found it better than others like Dreamweaver. It has the same interface for all microsoft application which saves your time to understand each icon and its funtion. When i tried frontpage 2000 i like its interface more but i don't think there is a big differences between it and the old version 98.  With all frontpage (98 and 2000) you need to know a bit about HTML in order to make clean-coded pages with less bugs. I like the  integration between Office software with frontpage 2000 , in which you can easily publish information stored in an Access database or Excel spreadsheet. I hope Microsoft will improve  manipulation with tables, because i really need to check the HTML code to organize any table i did in frontpage. Another thing, for arab users, you can not highlight the right arabic text in frontpage 2000 editor i.e if u try to highlight any word the editor will higlight another word!!! which is very annoying thing (you should use the HTML code to manipulate any word!!) So, Stick with your frontpage 98 if you want to design arabic pages.", "label": 2}

And like other reviewers, I'm impressed by (1) its low price, (2) the quality of its antivirus program and the frequency with which definitions are updated, (3) the fact of free tech support by phone and e-mail, and (4) the whole program's relatively low impact on computer memory and speed.\n\nOn the other hand, knowledgeable users seem concerned about the quality of its firewall - a concern corroborated by PC Mag's new review ([...]) and by the failure to cloak ports on my computer.  Moreover, the spyware filter failed to catch two suspicious files flagged by another leading program.  And the antispam filter has only about an 80% success rate in my experience.\n\nMore worrisome are the bugs.  At first PCC would hang while attempting to download updates -- a problem eventually fixed by uninstalling the program (which I had loaded from a CD) and reinstalling it from the Trend Micro website.  But two more issues have been unresolvable despite countless hours spent with various tech support people and several escalations.  First, the e-mail scanner fails to display a pop-up confirmation, leaving me less than certain that the scans are happening reliably.  Second, when I awaken my computer from stand-by, Outlook Express freezes while attempting to download messages, requiring me to restart Windows.  No need to recount the various suggestions made by the tech support people, some reasonable and some clearly silly.  All have failed.  (At one point, the T.M. level-2 techie had me scan for spyware with another company's program -- a tacit admission of PCC's inadequacy.)\n\nI very much wanted (and expected) to like PC-cillin, but it has cost me an enormous amount of time and still doesn't work properly.  Even if I persevere and these issues are solved at some point, I'll probably disable the firewall and spyware features just as I've already gone back to another antispam program.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have mixed feelings about Norton SystemWorks 2003. On one hand, I'm a longtime user of the SystemWorks family of products, and I feel no Windows computer is complete without vital Norton tools like SpeedDisk and WinDoctor. On the other hand, I've been terribly disappointed with this release of NSW. Here's why:\n Primarily, NSW 2003 doesn't include any obvious updates to existing software. I upgraded from NSW 2001, and I really don't see any changes in the functionality of any existing tools. The color scheme and interface has been revised to match Windows XP's friendly pastels and rounded curves, but I really don't see any difference in the way the components actually work. So why upgrade?\n Second, NSW 2003 does not play nice with older versions of Windows. In particular, it loads an executable into memory, whether you want to use any \"active\" tools (such as AntiVirus or Registry Tracker) or not. Under Windows 2000 and XP, this application runs as a service and doesn't cause any problems; but on my Windows 98SE platform, it causes noticeably slower startups and shutdowns, and occasionally causes the system to hang when shutting down. I realize that Windows 98 is now a bit long in the tooth, but Symantec really should have put more effort into making NSW 2003 compatible with Win98 if it is to be advertised as such on the box.\n In summary: On one hand, Norton SystemWorks is a solid heir to a useful dynasty of tools for Windows. On the other hand, there is little if any advantage over recent editions of the software, and backwards compatibility is deficient. I suggest that if you have Win2k or XP and do not yet have Norton SystemWorks, pick it up. If you are running an older version of Windows or already have SystemWorks 2001 or later, pass this one by.", "label": 2}

The most obvious is that when you try to check, for example, summed results from donations or depreciation entries you will often end up with differences of several dollars. This is annoying and makes it difficult to detect mistakes. An a matter of curiosity I went through and corrected the roundings in most places quickly on my first draft taxes, and the Taxcut rounding looks like it cost me about $15 in taxes!! I haven't looked into whether there is some reason to expect a direction bias in the data that would be entered, but be warned that the real cost of this software may be higher than listed and that it may be difficult to match up sums with the entered information due to rounding. I contacted Taxcut support and they sent me the email equivalent of \"yeah, so what.\"\n\nI'm somewhat surprised that they would cut such a simple corner, it's not like modern computers can't handle tracking pennies.\n\nOn the positive side I like the way the program has the forms down below and accessible to see what is going on. You can click \"whole form\" and review exactly how the information you are entering is being processed within the forms. I like the way you can jump around and enter data so I was able to work on the return in chunks instead of straight through - this became very important when I realized that I would be getting a corrected 1099 and shouldn't work on that section yet. But be careful to go back and page through each module when you are done, many changes are not reflected in the final calculation until you pass through the end of each module in a linear fashion. I have found that I can go back and change certain values, then JUMP to the end and have the value be entered but not reflected in the calculation. Presumably this would result in the submission of a return that doesn't add up - so go through the whole thing again linearly before you submit it.\n\nAll in all it seems like a fairly good program but I doubt I would use it again due to the rounding issue.", "label": 2}

The software is mostly written text that you have to read (it does not read to you).

{"text": "I have been using Topo! since it was a Wildflower product back in the early 1990's. The interface does take some getting used to as mentioned before, but like all powerful software programs (vi/emacs) eventually, it becomes second nature.\n\nI mostly use TOPO! to annotate my previous trips, plan future trips, share travel guides with family, and create georeferenced raster maps for handheld GPS devices.\n\nMy trips primarily used to be hiking and backpacking trips, which I would dutifully record using an old Garmin Etrex GPS receiver. The tracks and waypoints would be uploaded to the desktop and saved as separate .tpo files. Back in the day, I was plenty happy just to see waypoint times and elevation gains as documentation of my backcountry trips. I would also use TOPO to create waypoint routes (up to 30) to be uploaded to the GPS receiver so that I could plan/program my future hikes into the Etrex.\n\nSince those early primitive days, both TOPO! and I have changed a lot! TOPO! has improved significantly in its featurea. Now that I have two kids and more money, my outdoor travels consist mostly of Jeeping, dry car camping, and ancient rock art hunting.\n\nNow, with the newer versions of TOPO, it is possible to add pictures and notes. In turn, these more detailed maps can be useful as travelogues not only for nostalgia, but also as travel guides for family members and friends who are using TOPO! as well.\n\nWhile similar functionality could be obtained by using Google Earth or Maps, this map sharing is dependent on \"cloud computing\". This may be feasible when sitting in a coffee shop in a metropolis or even at home, but out in the desert without cellphone access this is not a viable option. Further, Google Map data is only protected by obscurity. Any person who knows the URL to your map data can view it.\n\nSince I don't have to carry gear on my back anymore, I primarily use TOPO in the field on a laptop with an external GPS receiver. Though bulky, it is a much more useful combination than simply a tiny handheld receiver alone due to the larger size of the laptop screen and the ability to search for waypoints using the standard keyboard. My family uses a similar setup and they too find it reassuring to know that they have a clearly mapped GPS route available to them in the wild.\n\nFinally, the most useful aspect of TOPO! is unfortunately no longer available, unless you can beg, borrow, or steal a boxed Xport Pro package. NatGeoMaps recently and quite quietly killed off its entire TopoPro line (including for ArcGIS). Xport Pro (formerly $199) allows the user to export high quality USGS maps in the georeferenced GeoTiff format. These GeoTiffs could then be used in shareware GPS programs like OziExplorer for Windows computers or OziWince or NoniGPSplot for WinCE GPS devices (many personal navigation devices can be cracked to run these apps in addition to the installed street mapping software). It used to be that you could call in a credit card number to NatGeoMaps customer service and for $99 get the functionality activated through a PIN, but no longer :( .\n\nAdmittedly, GeoTiff, mrsid, and many other georeferenced maps can be downloaded from state governments (usually from depts of ag or wildlife management), but having it all in one software package on CD's is pretty sweet.", "label": 1}

Changing thread colors is ridiculously difficult, there's no option to say, change all the black stitches to red, or change the blue stitches to a lighter/darker blue. You have to change them one at a time (it's like paint, the fill option only fills what's touching, so if you have a diagonal line you have to do it all individually). Furthermore I like to pull up the patterns on my tablet while I'm stitching instead of printing out a bunch of pages, and it's almost impossible with this software. It doesn't let you save it as anything but a pattern file or .xms, I literally had to screenshot the whole thing, paste it back together in Paint, and convert that to a PDF to get it on my tablet. It was a pain. It's okay for pattern creation but the user interface is clunky and old-fashioned. None of the commands and options are intuitive, you have to read the directions thoroughly multiple times to get the hang of it.

If I am to upgrade to a new version of Quickbooks and then pay a monthly fee for the deluxe online billing service, the only thing I expect is the full functionality they advertise and a professional image that it would portray.\nInstead, their Terms of Use state that, \"From time to time, Intuit may promote and/or advertise other products and services through the Online Service, including but not limited to placement of Content and/or links to other sites or resources within Online Service forms, invoices and statements.\"\nThey have the right to advertise to me all they want, since I was a regular customer of their products, however trying to market through invoices and statements is ridiculous.  They need to use their quickbooks users to advertise for them, not potentially bring down my reputation with my customers.\nMy review focused on this since it was the single reason I got the software and subsequently returned it.  Don't get your customers hooked on something and then have to pull it.  Export your quickbooks data to a database and have someone set up a SSL webpage for your customers to view their invoices and statement.

{"text": "Summary: I am torn between giving this two and three stars. Given all the \"one star\" ratings, which I think are too harsh, I'm giving this three stars, but really, I think of it as 2.5 stars. It's not something I can recommend, yet I use it, and it's the best implementation yet of the Franklin Covey system. But it is plagued by quality control problems, and you can run into problems that range from minor usability issues, to crashes, and even minor damage to your Outlook data file.\n\n- - - - - -\n\nI've been a huge fan of the Franklin system since before it was Franklin-Covey. I have searched for years for a good electronic implementation of it, and have even worked hard to try to get Outlook to mimic some of its features.\n\nThe PlanPlus for Outlook add-on actually comes very close to fully implementing the FC system within Outlook, which is extremely convenient, as it integrates all your contacts, email, tasks, etc. in one environment. But as other reviewers have stated - and as I have personally experienced over years and years of using different versions of FC software - software quality is NOT something they understand. It's very frustrating.\n\nIn my case, I don't even try to get the Palm conduits to work, and using Outlook 2003, I run into various issues ranging from the occasional outright crash, to Outlook \"disabling\" the FC software after it crashes on quitting (extremely common), to serial number \"key\" problems, and more. PlanPlus definitely is doing lots of stuff behind the scenes to Outlook when it installs, and given their penchant for writing poor software, this is scary, and can result in some extremely nasty problems. You do NOT like to see Outlook launch, warn you that the file was not properly closed, and then start rebuilding it. So far, I haven't seen any clear data loss, but it scares me, and that's one of the big three no-no's of software design (\"Do not frighten the user!\").\n\nAll that being said, when it DOES work, it's actually a darned good implementation of the Franklin-Covey system. I like having the FC system of symbols for task management, and the task organizer is fair for managing daily vs master tasks, prioritizing, etc. By integrating with Outlook and automatically carrying forward uncompleted tasks, it eliminates much of the need for touching every task every day. There are some shortcomings - for instance, you can't select multiple tasks and perform a mass action - but I don't find they get in the way too much.\n\nSome of FC's weekly capabilities, such as the Project Compass and Projects windows, are intriguing, and I actually have used their weekly approach (versus the \"daily\" approach of just tasks). But for the most part, their implementations are tantalizing for what they could be, and fall short of being truly workable as designed today.\n\nI have a hard time recommending this software, but if you are a dyed-in-the-wool Franklin-Covey fan, and are willing to put up with the bugs (and a sort of Russian Roulette game when you install it, as you might be the unlucky one who has REAL problems), it's worth looking at. There is a demo version available from their web site, but if you install it, realize that uninstalling it completely may be difficult, although I personally have had no problems after uninstalling it on various machines.\n\nI keep hoping that someday they'll get it right, and this is the closest they have come so far. They develop at an astoundingly slow pace, however, so don't hold your breath waiting for the next revision!\n\n  ..Chris..", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have taken Spanish classes off and on over the years, but this is the first computer DVD set that I have tried (Many years ago I tried the Pimsler audio cassette series for French and really liked them).  I am pretty conversant in Spanish, having learned it mostly just from working with and around Spanish-speaking people over the years.  I found this computer-aided method of learning to not work particularly well for me.  Even though I spend most of my time during work hours in front of the computer (or perhaps because of it), I found it hard to be engaged by this program.\n\nSome overall thoughts:\n\nI personally found the user interface to be pretty clunky.  It has a distinct \"Fischer Price\" feel to it with lots of blocky pictures and primary colors.  I found the awkwardly animated \"talking heads\" to be more of a distraction and annoyance than a useful tool for learning pronunciation.\n\nI found it hard to understand what \"lesson\" I should be following.  There does not seem to be a directly prescriptive path that the program wants you to follow, so you tend to spend a lot of time poking around and exploring, which might be entertaining, but doesn't lead to a cohesive and structured learning process.  This is what I've always liked about audio CDs or cassette tapes - they are numbered, and you listen to them in sequence (usually accompanied by a workbook).  You *can* skip ahead if you like, but you always know where you left off and jumped ahead, making it easy to go back if you want.  Using this program, I really felt \"lost\" a lot of the time.\n\nMy 13-year old daughter is taking Spanish in school and LOVES it, yet I could not get her interested in this program at all.  I think she had the same problem I did - sitting in front of the computer just doesn't seem conducive to being able to focus on and learn a language.\n\nBottom line, I think this product is adequate for \"refreshing\" yourself if your high school or college Spanish is a bit rusty, but I don't think it is designed in a way to be well-suited for learning the language from scratch.  For an elementary or middle school kid, it might be a good accompaniment to their classroom work, as it is reasonably entertaining to use, and contains a lot of vocabulary drills and lessons, along with lots of phrases that you can learn.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This product was previously released under the name \"Thomas Nelson Study Reference Library\" for about the same price.  I could not believe that this offer was real, but it was!  You truly get what is advertised.  In fact, I am still amazed at the extensive amount and quality of the information made available through this product.\n\nThe library is based on Libronix search technology.  For this reason, there is really no limit to the books that can be added.\n\nInstallation of the library is not quite straightforward.  There is a registration step that is mandatory before the product registration grace period expires.  It is essential that you back up the registration codes!  I wrote them on the CD label, and am glad that I did when I had to reinstall the software later following a hard drive crash.\n\nAnother challenge is in installing the books on your hard drive, which you will probably want to do since hard drive space is far less of an issue than it used to be.  The installation of the software does not install all of the books as well--this is a manual step.  The drop-down menus are complex and somewhat confusing, so you will need to read and follow the instructions carefully.\n\nYou will find that a lot of Nelson Publisher's information is redundant between books, so that when you search for a narrow topic and find the results in five different books, all five books are likely going to say almost the same thing.  However, what they do say is quite useful.\n\nOne of the most outstanding uses that I have found from this library is the KJV expository by word, with word-for-word references to Greek and Hebrew equivalents.  A full expository research can be quickly performed on any Biblical text.  With full Vine's and Strong's resources integrated into the product, this becomes an indispensable study reference library.\n\nThe SFL books are great study resources for Bible study groups or personal edification.\n\nPerhaps the greatest accolade that I can give this product is that, despite a year of heavy use, I have yet to access all of the information available in this library--not because it is hard to access, but simply because I just haven't had the time to explore the myriad of information available!", "label": 1}

Since the publishing of CDROM (fall of sales of the print version) and the beginning of strong competition (encarta, etc...), they must have been very reluctant to publish their encyclopedia on CDROM at such a low price (though at the beginning, they managed to charge their cdrom at around $600 if i remember properly the price i paid at that time, around 1998).\n\nThis year's interface (britannica 2005) is no exception: slow (this year it's 256mb of memory recommended...wow...) and browsing / search functions to its most basic, extremely poor indeed.\n\nAnd as usual the \"propedia\" of the print version is not included, which would help so much to browse and find appropriate articles.\n\nWhat's best to do then?\n\nComplain to them won't help (since all the years they must have been receiving so many complains by now but they don't care, this is classic corporation, money strategy first (= print version)), morals later.\n\nTherefore, I'll keep my 2002 version (or keep your 2003 / 2004) as there isn't any notable change with 2005 (only 3% of content updated I estimate)and i bought the latest encarta 2005 (and the next ones when it'll be out) as supplement, especially for update information and the good atlas.\n\nNo more spending on britannica for now this until they eventually decide to develop good software.\n\nI was lucky enough to have been able to preview of the 2005 britannica version (hence the result in this review) from a collegue who've bought it without second thought (which she does regret).", "label": 2}

My recommendation to anyone with 2000 or 2001 is to keep what you've got.\nHere are my complaints.  First, in order to install 2002 in the default directory, I had to uninstall 2000.  The 2000 version was pre-installed on my computer, so there is no practical way to recover it.  You can change the install directory, but I suspect that this will result in numerous conflicts and files not found.\nThe program crashes constantly, although the number of crashes seems to decrease with use.\nYou get bombarded with alerts and suggestions for scheduled transactions that must be cleared out one at a time (automated alerts is one of the features advertised in this version).  Buy a book from Amazon.com, and the purchase will appear as an alert for the next month.  I continue to get warnings that several accounts are past due, even though they are all up to date and have entries in the register.  Several areas show some type of warning icon that I cannot get rid of.  For example, I have chosen not to supply some information on my bank accounts to Quicken.  The result is warning icons on the overview pages for the account.\nPlanning, tax, and investment calculations appear inaccurate.  I am also unimpressed by the Quicken's inability to handle more that one Flexible Spending Account.\nFinally, as other users have noted, you get bombarded with links for other Quicken services.

{"text": "Windows ME just isn't worth the investment.  It is just Windows 98 with some added features.  The core operating system is still the same, unreliable OS it always was.\nLet's start by looking at the plus side.  The new features are pretty nice.  Windows Media Player is much better than its predecessors.  Internet Explorer 5.5 is a great browser and not having to download the beast is an added bonus.  The auto update feature (while somewhat annoying at times) is much easier than searching the web for the latest software updates.  If you feel these features are reason enough to upgrade your to ME, then go for it.\nAs I said, ME still has plenty of reliability problems.  It is still possible for a single application to bring down the entire operating system.  In my experience it has been rare that I actually get the OS to shut down properly.  I have used Linux and NT for years and gotten used to their stability.  I had forgotten just how bad the stability of this line of operating systems could be.\nOne word of caution if you are still thinking about making the purchase: pay attention to the system requirements!  I tried installing the upgrade on an old Pentium 133 Mhz system.  The requirements say a minimum of 150 Mhz is needed, but I figured the OS would just run slowly so I went ahead with the install.  After ME partitioned and formatted my hard drive, it told me my system didn't meet the 150 Mhz requirement and exited the installation.\nThere you have it, the pluses, minuses and some annecdotes.

In the past, I've put up with installation and integration problems, Liveupdate problems, etc., but I've always stuck with their products because the problems weren't all that significant and the functionality worked well once you got it installed.\n\nIn the 2004 version of NIS I ran into a problem where Norton Antispam would cause Microsoft Outlook to crash when first started if more than one userid was logged onto the machine (apparently a common problem based on google searches). Since my wife and I both use the same machine a lot, this usually meant one of us experienced Outlook crashing at least once a day.  I reported the problem to Symantec support, went through deinstalling and reinstalling several times (on the advice of the support team), but the problem was never fixed.  Eventually, I just gave up and got used to it (annoying, but not a show stopper).\n\nSadly, I just tried the Trialware version of the NIS 2005 product and the same problems with Norton Antispam crashing Microsoft Outlook still exist.  Overall, the product seems better integrated and a bit more polished, but if you have multiple users of Outlook using the same machine with different Windows user accounts be prepared for the same problems that have been around for awhile.\n\nNormally, I'd give the product a 4 or 5 (the Antivirus product works well, the Firewall is very solid, and the Antispam product cuts down the clutter in your Outlook inbox as long as you don't mind the crash on startup).  But with the lack of attention to fixing a long term and well known bug I can only give the 2005 version a 3 star rating.\n\nIf you are the only one that uses your PC, this is a great product.

{"text": "I bought FrontPage 98 a few years ago probably for the same reason you're at this page now--I wanted to start making my own web pages, but I was intimidated by all the stuff I would have to learn.\nFrontPage is a great tool to get you started, but, if you talk to enough people, and you spend as time on the phone with tech support as I find I have to do because of problems related to FrontPage, you'll hear the same thing over and over again: FrontPage writes messy code, Dreamweaver does not.\nWhy? Well the answer is both simple and familiar: Microsoft, once again, has chosen to create its own set of standards rather than follow those 95% of the rest of the world uses. Consequently, all the \"extra stuff\" required behind the scenes to make FrontPage work is essentially incompatible with many other things.\nIn fact, I upgraded from FP 2000 because it had a major bug, a known issue, as they call it--it cannot upload large sites; it almost always gives some sort of error when doing so. Worse, you MUST use FP to upload; you cannot simply FTP your files as you can with other HTML generators. FP uploads in a special way that is necessary for FP to function properly.\nSo, I upgraded to FP 2002, and the upload problem was fixed, but more problems were created. My current web host and at least two other ones (two of which are the largest in the industry) have told me the same thing--they are not supporting FP 2002 yet because it is too buggy.\nI now realize that I should have just learned Dreamweaver in the beginning, and have a purely Dreamweaver site.

{"text": "I have been a fan of Oregon Trail for many years. It is therefore with great pain that I say the following: Don't buy this game.\nOregon Trail 5 is not a new game. The programmers of Oregon Trail 5, whether from lack of funding or laziness, took 1996 vintage Oregon Trail 2 and rereleased it with minor changes (which I will describe below.) That's it.\nLet me repeat, because this is important. THIS IS OREGON TRAIL 2 FROM 1996 IN A NEW BOX. Oregon Trail 2 was not a bad game for 1996. But times have changed, and today it is a nightmare. The graphics are terrible messes of blurry colored dots (1996 vintage, remember?) and the actual gameplay is just \"click the button to go on\" and allows no real creativity. The only changes that have been made are for the worse. The varied and enjoyable western soundtrack of Oregon Trail 2 has been changed to a single 30 second long cliche'd song that constantly loops. A few new videos are added that are poorly animated, employ worser voice actors, and add nothing to the game. In fact, they are quite jarring, as they interrupt whatever you were doing with no warning. A poorly-done fishing mini-game has also been added. And as a bonus, numerous bugs have been introduced: save often, or you might find your progress lost when the game crashes on you. Remember, Oregon Trail 2 was written for Windows 3.1, not Windows XP and Windows Vista, and a rerelease doesn't change the fact that it simply isn't made to run on modern computers. It doesn't even run well on a Windows 95 or 98 system, despite the game's claim that it should.\nSave yourself much hassle and annoyance. This game is not worth getting.

{"text": "Yes, this product has hidden costs like tech support, yearly tax tables, and upgrades, but it is still better than doing bookkeeping for a small business by hand.\n\n Some of the other fees one doesn't think about are:\n\n 1. Printer checks, invoices (if you choose to use perforated forms or letterhead), and envelopes for both. No bank will supply QB checks for free...and they aren't cheap either.\n\n 2. To email your invoices you have to subscribe to \"online billing\" for a fee...However, I found that one can simply print the invoice, scan it and email it as an attachment.\n\n 3. To do direct deposit for payroll, one must subscribe to \"payroll direct deposit\" for a fee. (I haven't figured out a way around this one yet.)\n\n Yes, there were some unpleasant tech support people--like there are everywhere, but I found the option of buying a year of tech support (appx. $350.00 ) to be very helpful for the first year I used this product. Support is available via phone, IM, and email. I found IM to be the best method. By the end of that year of support I was asking questions that stumped tech. support, or I was able to think of a better solution myself, so this product is not hard to figure out...but it does take some figuring out. And it is nice to have the cushion of support while you learn. (The manual is valueless-use the help button or better: buy \"Quickbooks for Dummies\".)\n\n With all those costs, you can expect to drop about $1000.00 up front just to get this program up and running.\n\n Hints:\n\n DO NOT EVER load any balances in QB for payroll or customers. You should go back and do every single transaction individually and backdate it the original date of the invoice or payment or whatever. Run your old payrolls one pay period at a time-print them on blank paper with the old check number. You MUST use the payroll liabilities feature to pay all payroll taxes--you can adjust the amounts to match what you have already paid before using QB, otherwise your balances and calculations in QB will be messed up all year like mine were. Even if you have to load a YEAR'S worth of transactions, it is better to do them one item at a time rather than load balances. Start at or as close to your fiscal year as possible for conversion to QB.\n\n DO buy tech support for six months or a year: it was well worth it, especially for 1099s and other headaches that one doesn't do everyday.\n\n SURPRISE: 1099s will print for only ONE accounting code--I found that out the hard way. So for 1099s, USE ONE MASTER ACCOUNT, if you need several 1099 codes, list them as subaccounts of the master account. I.E.: 1099 Contractors, and have 1099 drafting, 1099 engineering, 1099 transporting as subaccounts.\n\n You HAVE TO have internet access to use this product. Try to have a highspeed connection to the internet, it takes up to 30 minutes to d/l the updates and tax tables via 56K dialup.\n\n DO NOT USE the \"enter bills\" and \"pay bills\" portion of the program. Just write the checks manually to vendors-that way you only have to do the work once.\n\n Make no mistake, if you buy this or any other accounting program for that matter, you will cease to be a bookkeeper and become a baby sitter for a computer, but it's still better than doing books by hand!", "label": 2}

I've found, however, that there are frequently glaring inaccuracies in the analyses. The most obvious is a tendency to list sodium as being 400+ mg. These errors happen even when all the ingredients in the recipe have full nutritional information in the database.\nWhen I followed their instructions for importing recipes (using some Meal Master recipes I downloaded from the internet) the program reacted very strangely and started giving me serious problems. For instance, some of the cookbooks disappeared, and the screen look changed. I uninstalled, then reinstalled it. For some reason that only partially corrected the problems.

{"text": "But it doesn't go far enough. Visio is one of those really cool, fun, products that you start to use and then you say \"ok, but where do I go from here?\"\nOne quite bizarre example is the database module for ER diagramming: It will REVERSE engineer a database beautifully, but... why would I want to do that if I can't use the diagram for anything but documentation purposes? So you think to yourself, \"well, ok, I have ERwin, so I'll just export it to that...\", but then you find out that Visio can IMPORT an ERwin model, but not export one??? What a strange omission! If Visio could export an ERwin model, I could buy ONE seat of a $4000 forward engineering database tool, and innumerable seats of $400 Visio! Then I could export to ERwin, forward engineer, and have my whole team using a very approachable, inexpensive tool to boot! I don't know, maybe even Microsoft if afraid of the mighty, abusive, litigous Computer Associates! This is kind of like the Dead Sea of software products: It will take you in, but you'll never get out!\nIn the software portion, it also is pretty much a dead end for forward engineering, although very cool and complete for documentation purposes, but Microsoft is also very tight with Rational and doesn't want to upset that apple cart either. One thing I was disappointed about was that nothing showed up as far as Java, C#, or .NET data types. I thought this was a little weird, as that's kind of the reason I upgraded. I didn't install it on my .NET server though, so maybe if you do that it picks that up, but to leave out Java is a little bit of an omission, I think.\nOn the plus side, the interface is beautiful, it does everything but the kitchen sink documentation wise, the shapes and the way they interact is downright magical, and the thing below about the software registration is really overblown: The only thing they make you provide is the country you reside in. In fact, it says right on the CD case \"Don't lose this number! You must use it EVERY TIME you install this software.\" Microsoft is realistic: they know that you will most likely put it on at least two of your computers, and they're not in panic mode.\nBottom line: The best \"single source\" documentation tool ever devised is Visio 2002.", "label": 2}
{"text": "If I were a teacher grading Windows XP, it would definitely get a \"C\". Here's why:\n\n1. It controls you; you don't control it. It literally occupies your computer, from the moment you install it. I did a clean NTFS format using another product, and XP insisted on reformatting the drive itself before it would install. Also, what options are you given at the time of installation? Language and time zone? That's too few. I'd like to be able to eliminate Outlook, Messenger, etc., but I never get that option.\n\n2. It's a resource hog. Consider the fact that my Mac runs at about half the speed of my PC, and yet multitasks much, much better. Worse, XP is actually designed to perform badly. The default installation is set up to give you the worst possible performance (and the maximum possible eye candy). Sure, you can change it, but even if you do its performance lags far behind other operating systems.\n\n3. Overpriced doesn't even begin to cover it. I can buy a family pack of OS X Tiger for $50 less than one retail copy of XP--that's five licenses, folks. That means that for a household with five computers, retail XP licenses would cost $1250, while OS X would cost $200. And don't even bother going with XP OEM. As of September, 2005, that license is only good for one hardware configuration. Motherboard goes out? It doesn't matter that it's still one system, add $200 to the cost of fixing it (for a new copy of XP).\n\n4. Is it stable? Yes... shouldn't that be a given? An unstable OS gets an \"F\". Stable just gets XP a \"C\". All this means is that every other OS Microsoft produced was pathetic.\n\n5. It's old. The OS is essentially unchanged from what it was in 2001. There have been a lot of changes since then, and XP is obviously nearing the end of its life cycle. As soon as the next greatest Windows OS is released, support will likely be cut for this one. In other words, it's a dinosaur on the verge of extinction.\n\n6. It's 32 bit, and it's the only major OS that hasn't made the transition. I realize that there is a 64 bit XP available, but read the reviews... it isn't ready yet. In other words, it's failing to keep up with advances in CPU design.\n\nAll the above lead me to conclude that it deserves no more than a \"C\". Power users should go with a Linux distro. Users who prefer ease of use should go with OS X. Who should use XP? Those who have no choice, because the programs they use aren't available on other platforms (that includes gamers).\n\nI think people don't like admitting that they have no choice, so they rationalize (making it appear as if being forced to use XP is a good thing). They say that XP is the best thing since sliced bread, even though they know it isn't. But not having a choice doesn't make XP a great OS, and it never will.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Sigh.. I held out such hopes for SmartSuite to do what I couldn't do in MS Office.  Alas, SmartSuite is in many ways, worse.  It has a few marginal advantages.  What I wanted it for the most, merge with spreadsheets, it can't do.  It can't merge spreadsheets even if you imported them into the 123 program and converted them to the same formats as available natively within Smartsuite!  Daft.\n\nThis is supposed to be the Ami Word processor, Lotus 123 for Windows (which is nowhere near as good as DOS), an organizer which doesn't work (depends on dialup, so is useless), and some other functions which are now very dated.  There is a current version of this program via IBM, but it costs $400.  Since the version number is also 9.8, I'm not too keen on trying it.  By contrast, this SmarSuite is less than $50.\n\nSo what is it good for?  Well, it can read other programs' files, starting with 9.8.  Not sure you can say it reads well in earlier versions.  9.0 has no file converters.  I had no luck with 9.6.  So am assuming 9.7 has the same problem.\n\nIn short, if you've got MS Word, Excel, WordPerfect and other files, it can convert them or at least read them (often with formatting which won't transfer properly).  It can read DOS Lotus 1-2-3 files and convert the formatting for Windows, but the calculations don't work as well (true ever since Lotus for Windows came out in version 3, which is why I kept on DOS).  So you'll have to proof which calculations didn't work (principally name and date formulas, from what I've seen).\n\nIt might be good at simple word processing, but the menu items and organization is so offputting, I don't want to even use it for that.  Of course, you get used to a particular word processor or spreadsheet structure, and then anything else feels unnatural.\n\nBasically, if you've got a bunch of DOS Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in the past, you really need this program, as it uses the same keys and ideas as in DOS.  So then you can manipulate the sheet using Windows, but not having to use Excel.  Then, you can convert to Excel afterwards.  Which you'll have to do, as MS Office 2003 and following will no longer accept wk1 files (unless you do the reg fixes MS specifically provides as overrides).\n\nBut beware that not all your formulas will work in the Windows version of 123.  So test that first.\n\nI'm really disappointed that the merge function doesn't work at all, with even spreadsheets you save in the Windows format.  The merge field thingy can't 'read' the first row with the field names, and doesn't know it is showing nothing.  Buggy.\n\nSo, I'll go back to MS Office, and keep SmartSuite for reading my WordPerfect stuff, since WordPerfect 2000 et seq are even worse in Windows -- won't even truly install, in XP -- than SmartSuite.", "label": 2}

Every now and then I see some interesting video that I would like to share with friends through Facebook. I needed a product that would allow me to edit my video files so I could send only the interesting parts and not the whole files. With Video Director I can edit my Drone Files, add Text and Music, and do other unique Effects then send the edited video to my friends.

{"text": "This product was a waste of money. The primary problem with it was that it is not a coherent product--it is a poorly repackaged mishmash of other products. My wife purchased this (not on Amazon) to try to improve her vocabulary which had gotten rusty. She found that the first disc was mostly okay, but several other discs were outdated programs designed for children, or wouldn't even run at all without installing other software such as the execrable QuickTime. She found that there was no apparent transition from the beginner disc to a much more advanced disc. If there was an intermediate disc, it was one of the ones that wouldn't run.\n\nThe best portions of the software come from a company called Eurotalk. This means the dialect of Spanish being taught is not American Spanish, but European Spanish, which is much less useful unless you happen to be planning a trip to Europe. This seriously reduces its usefulness to Americans looking to improve their Spanish skills for the sake of improving their marketability for a job, for instance. The fact that this was European Spanish was not mentioned on the packaging, so we were misled. And the Eurotalk segments are not all in the same series, so some are for kids and some are not.\n\nWorst of all, the money-back guarantee offered by the makers of the product is a complete sham. To get your money back you have to ship them the software, for which they recommend you purchase insurance and use a trackable method, and include a letter asking for a refund, then wait 6-8 weeks for your refund. If you don't get it, you have only an address to write to to ask where your money is or you can e-mail them. Oh, and they don't refund your shipping or your sales tax. Cute.\n\nWhat's the difference between them and Rosetta Stone? They claim the difference is only about $500, but at least Rosetta Stone is selling a complete product. For those who are looking for an immersive form of Spanish learning that is less expensive and slightly less immersive (i.e. will give you a little English to work with) than Rosetta Stone, don't expect to get much out of this product.

{"text": "If you're looking at Pages as a replacement for Word, it isn't -- and wasn't designed to be. As they say at Apple, Think Different. Pages is somewhere between a word processor and a page-layout tool. It has some features from both, but not all of the features you'd want, or need, from products in either of those categories. That Apple has decided to go after this \"in-between market\" is interesting in its own right. They have a well-earned reputation for this type of thing. Pages will in all likelihood eventually succeed, in no small part due to the platform it's on (OS X) and the ability to integrate it with other software, especially iPhoto. Pages 1.0, though, has some significant weaknesses.\n\nIf you're hoping that Page's Export to Word, PDF or HTML features will allow you to use its beautiful designs as a starting point (i.e., you want to design in Pages then export and finish the job), don't buy this 1.0 version. Exports to Word don't work well or, for HTML, at all. It's not just that \"things look a little different\" in the exported files, the exports are often unusable (except when for the simplest layouts) and often so different as to be unrecognizable. Also, as is typical for any product that makes use of the built-in OS X \"export to PDF\" capability, be aware that the exported file size will be huge -- an order of magnitude larger than it would be if you created the document with Adobe software.\n\nIf you're hoping to make use of Page's \"professionally designed\" templates, also be aware that as exceptionally well designed as they are, this can be a double-edged sword. Why? Because they're designed as a whole unit, including the \"placeholder\" photographs. When you replace one of those photos with your own (a process that is very easy to do because of the integration with iPhoto), you will most likely lose a lot of that \"professionally designed\" advantage unless the colors in your photo are quite similar to those in the placeholder photo it replaced. Put another way, all the surrounding colors in the template were chosen very carefully to match those in the template photo. Change the photo and you're back to square one (okay..., maybe square two) and will have to figure out which new surrounding colors to use on your own. A similar problem occurs if your photo is significantly different in size or shape or if you get \"too creative\" in your choice of fonts. You can easily weaken or ruin a page's design with a seemingly minor change.\n\nNone of the above, except for the PDF export size issue, has anything to do with Keynote which, to the extent I've used it, seems to be a great product completely in line with what one comes to expect from Apple. My impression of what went wrong with Pages is that it got rushed to meet an unrealistic release date.

What they should have done with this product was to include 10 categories of each feature, 10 games, 10 themes etc. Just to make the product at least seem worthy of the price you are paying, remember most of the features are not full versions, the fish tank for one is not a full version that hyperbowl thing is not full version. Media Player features are really not necessary and you need a lot of PC Horse Power for the voice recognition which I think needs better integration with the product itself. Overall most of the features in here you can find elsewhere online. The product price needs to be dropped also.", "label": 2}

Long story short - it took me eleven hours and paying someone $200 to come to my home and help install Norton.  Matching my error message with their web site stated the problem was new and that Norton had no solution for it.  By using other tools on their site, I was able to scan my system for viruses.

{"text": "Just received my Norton Internet Security 2005 to replace my 2004.  After installing it and configuring it, here's my review:\n\nI'd like to give this product a rating in each aspects below:\n\nEase of installation:  **  (2 stars)\n\nFeature set, reliability and dependability:  *****  (5 stars)\n\nThe installation process and the setup interface portion really need some improvement to make it easier and more robust.  This is probably why many users gave it a poor rating.  I had some problems installing it and had to uninstall and re-install to get it working correctly.  But once installed and updated, it works fine.\n\nIn terms of the features, I find that the firewall, intrusion detection, anti-virus, and ad-blocking all work very well and are very dependable.  It's also fairly easy to configure and update.\n\nHowever, there was one problem in the 2004 edition that I have not had a chance to check if it's fixed:  The stock streamer quote from some brokers won't work and there is no way to adjust it.  This is a deal killer for me, and probably for many others who need to get real time stock quotes without compromising security.  I'll need to spend some time to check if this problem is fixed in this 2005 version.  If it's not fixed, then to me, it's not acceptable.  I'll definitely have to dump this and get a different product.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The package is beautiful, the bio feedback (Light Stone) could be useful if you get the expansion pack but the program itself is not ready for prime time.\n\nOne gets the feeling that their intentions were in the right place but they didn't have the technical skills to pull it off. While the pictures in the program are generally pleasant they are at least 1 if not 2 generations behind graphics found in any other game today. The game only plays in 600 x 800 resolution which on 17\" or larger high res monitors looks low class and fuzzy. The pixals are so large that all movement on the screen is just slightly out of focus scenery. The same for all the backgrounds of mountains and waterfalls. The settings could have been beautiful but end up almost cartoon like.\n\nThe bio feedback which controls much of the game is not very sensitive to your real mood. You can mostly control it by either breathing slowly or rapidly and think whatever you want. There aren't any puzzles involved in the play and the movement is strangely slow for a game in low res graphics that is totally loaded on your hard drive. I guess they are trying to teach you to be calm inspite of the maddenly slowness of the game. You move by pointing a wand then the game pauses and starts to move (mostly slightly out of focus objects) then stops and you wait for the wand to reappear to start all over again. This game almost feels like it was a port from a pre pentium world.\n\nI will agree on one area, that is kids under 12 will probably like it. So like the parents as it contains no violence or even moderate action. The music is standard new age and all the characters you meet seem to think that you are about 8 years old or at least that is how they talk so don't expect that the secrets involve anything intellectual only a lot of breath in to the count of seven and breath out to the count of seven.

Now, we use Visio at work, and therefore I have been doing all of my drawings with Visio (for probably the last 8 - 10 years). Recently, however, I had to do some additional work at home in order to get a project's documentation prepared in time.\n\nAnd because I have been using Visio for a long time (and therefore I know it very well) I decided to buy myself a copy [NOTE: I don't believe in pirated software]. However, when I saw the price for Visio, I was shocked ... and I realised I would never be able to afford it at that hugely inflated price. I don't have the funds like big corporations do, after all...\n\nSo then I started looking for alternatives ... and found several that were either free or had a free evaluation copy. I downloaded about 5 or 6 different ones, and installed them all.\n\nThen I started using them ... and one by one I came to the conclusion \"this one is no alternative to Visio ... it barely does the minimum\" ... and some of them were so clunky. Each of them went quickly down the uninstall path --- except SmartDraw.\n\nI found that I could get to work quickly with SmartDraw, even though the user interface is quite different to Visio (which I know very well due to many years' use). Using the evaluation version of SmartDraw I was able to finish my system documentation in spite of me being a novice SmartDraw user.\n\nSo, naturally, when I needed to have a visual processor to do some charting for my own business, I had no hesitation to purchase SmartDraw. I had already done all the analysis previously, and I knew that SmartDraw could do what I needed it to do.\n\nWhat I didn't realise at the time of making the purchase, is that SmartDraw also has a massive library of tutorials and other training materials on their site, some of which I have already used and found helpful.\n\nI am by no means a SmartDraw expert (yet), but from what I have seen so far I consider it to be even more powerful than Visio in certain areas.\n\nThere are some aspects of SmartDraw that are still a bit strange to me, but that is probably only  because I'm not an expert user yet. For instance, I drew a Timeline graph, and then wanted to move some of the elements. I found that I could move them, but that the connecting lines didn't stay connected, so I had to re-connect the lines. I also wanted to change the shape of an item, and although the help indicated that it is was possible to do it I couldn't do it (but I'm sure this was due to my lack of knowledge rather than a defect in SmartDraw.\n\nGiven what I know now, would I buy SmartDraw again?\n\nAbsolutely!

{"text": "I am actually reviewing the online version from Rosetta Stone Online, which makes the full Level I and II versions available by subscription.\nEach section consists of a series of Listening, Reading/Listening, Speaking, and Reading exercises. The full version of this software consists of 19 units of 10-12 sections each.\nIn each exercise, you are given a series of activities consisting of a choice of four pictures and/or pieces of text and/or spoken dialogues (depending on which type of activity it is), and you must choose the correct picture/text/dialogue from the cues.\nThe exercises are very simple, suitable for children or for quick reviews. If you are new to Arabic, or refreshing your skills after a long period of disuse, the repetition will be useful in building your vocabulary (back) up. You are fed bits of grammar incrementally with each new unit. You start with simply identifying various people and objects, and then add a few adjectives, and then add a few verbs so you are recognizing simple sentences such as \"The boy drinks some milk\" or \"The bird flies\" or \"This car is not red, it is white,\" etc. Each unit adds more pieces of grammar and more vocabulary, building up to more complex sentences, different verb tenses, and so on.\nHowever, that is as far as it can take you. Diligently practicing all the exercises should expand your vocabulary and give you basic grammatical skills in Arabic. It will not bring you to the point of being able to carry on a meaningful conversation (unless your conversations are confined to describing objects and pointing at various people and animals and stating what they are doing), nor will it enable you to, say, read a newspaper.\nFor self-study, this software makes a good supplement to more robust texts and tapes. Don't expect it to bring you up to full proficiency. If you want to do more than recognize simple sentences and learn a lot of \"everyday vocabulary,\" Rosetta Stone is insufficient. However, I do recommend it for the crucial repetition and \"training your ear\" that every language student needs, especially those doing self-study, if you are at a low to moderate proficiency level.\nIt is important to note that the text is entirely in Arabic script. You must be able to read Arabic before you can practice anything but the listening exercises. (Get a good book on Arabic script and learn it -- it's not that difficult, a serious student should be able to read the script fairly proficiently within a week.) Also, there are no English translations at all. This is not a bad thing -- the way the information is presented, you are expected to pick up the meaning as you go along, and if you practice the exercises seriously, you will. Just be aware that this software is based on the Audio-Lingual method, so you will find no glossaries or explanations of grammar.", "label": 2}

The program shows both great promise and great problems.\nThe problems start with the system requirements.  Throw out what they are telling you.  A minimum system to do anything serious in a reasonable time is a 2 GHz P4 and 1 GB RDRAM - in short a high end system.  You can use a lesser system if you are willing to compromise, but be aware you need as much memory as possible or the system will be crashing frequently.

Setting gravity equal to -1 in the hair room stretches a pony tail like it is entering a black hole.

Given the thousands of free files available, this is a major plus.\nStability with XP and a high end system are good, but many people report problems with crashes and installation issues.\nOverall I would buy this version and patch it immediately if you are new to POSER but wait if you have POSER 4 and are happy.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I got this game for my four year old [she turned four three months ago], and she can do, or muddle through most of it. But there are a few mouse based puzzles that are just really hard, where you have to move an object through a maze without touching anything. I am a graphic artist who illustrates with a mouse, and they are a little challenging for me, so they've got to be quite hard for kids. Most of the challenges consist of matching puzzles, of which some are pretty nicely drawn and challenging, as the objects to be matched are pretty similar. A few of the matching puzzles are painfully simple and repetitive, but they are probably pretty well targeted at the five or six year old.\n\nThe complaints about the quality of the graphics are from folks unfamiliar with 3d renderings and modeling. The quality is fairly consistent with late 90s games and older online 3d games. It's adequate [particularly when objects are in motion, it doesn't matter nearly as much how elaborately they are rendered -- imagine the difference between observing a painting and watching a play], and considering the price of the game [I got it for $10 in a retail store], it's fine.

{"text": "We purchased this for our eight-year-old son for Christmas.  I installed it to test it out ahead of time.  Here are my observations...\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that you CANNOT get control of the game unless the program wants you to.  You cannot get a mouse pointer to click on something while the compter is talking (and it talks a lot).  When you first install it (or you're a new player playing it for the first time), you HAVE to sit through a long, drawn-out animation sequence that takes about five minutes.\n\nThe navigation within the game is difficult because there are no written words.  Everything is icon-based, so you have to memorize what each icon does, and if, heaven-forbid, you choose something other than what you wanted to select, you have to wait out the animation and talking before you can back out to another screen.\n\nIn addition to that, there are several exercises within the game.  The chess pieces are cartoony pictures that don't look anything like the actual chess pieces.  I found no way to change these into the real chess piece images.  The only place I found that you can do this is while you're playing a real chess game.\n\nAnother really annoying glitch is that you cannot exit the game in a quick manner.  Typical game protocol is, if you hit escape or alt-F4, you can get out of the game quick- that is, you get a prompt, you say yes, then it gives you a splash screen or something, and you can escape out of that quickly.  Not this one.  If you hit escape or find your way through the menus to choose exit, you are prompted (you have to wait for it to finish talking first), then when you choose yes, you have to wait out the animations again.  It's a total of several minutes to get out of the game.\n\nI really want to say that this is a great game, because it looks well put-together, but the lack of control, lack of icon labels, and cartoon chess pieces are just too much for me.  I didn't have the patience to play this game for very long.  I hope my son has more patience than me when playing this.", "label": 2}

You have to create lots of small files, export them to the pda, and manually select with one to use.\n- no trip data(such as miles to destination and eta ) on the pda\n- no prompting for upcoming turns.\nFor $30(after rebate), I cannot complain.

{"text": "SNUFF - The legendary 1977 grindhouse favorite!  Remember that great marketing campaign? - \"The movie they said no producer could make, no distributor would release, and no audience could stomach. This is the one and only original legendary atrocity shot by Monarch Films in South America and New York, where human life is cheap!  The mystery and controversy surrounding this vicious and violent venture remains clouded to this day. Many of the actors and actresses who dedicated their lives to making this film were never seen or heard from again.  SNUFF is the film that went too far - it contains scenes of sadism, bondage, bloodshed and mutilation too real to be simulated, too shocking to be ignored.  Are the killings in this film real? You be the judge!\"  Hahhahahahahhaha!\nThis classic 42nd Street favorite is anything but real (at least in my opinion - you be \"the judge\"), but whatever you decide, there is no denying that it is an HILARIOUSLY campy, ridiculously-dubbed south-of-the-border exploitation flick!  If you don't know it's history, the producers had bought a bad, sleazy 1971 Argentinian revenge flick called \"The Slaughter\", cut off the ending, added a terribly fake newly shot unrelated \"snuff\" sequence at the end instead, changed the title to \"Snuff\" and released it to unsuspecting crowds in 1977. I'm sure it caused a few riots at the time.  Is there any snuff in it?  No.  Is it even about snuff?  No.  But who cares, it's all in the marketing, right?\nThis hilariously marketed \"limited edition\" disc from Blue Underground is as bare-bones as you can get.  The keepcase is a replica of a crinkled paper bag.  No mention of actors, cast, crew or Blue Underground.  Just a UPC code and the limited edition # printed on  the back.  Insert the disc and the movie starts playing automatically - there's no menu screen at all and the movie is not divided into any chapter stops.  Full frame presentation  looks and sounds OK overall. Don't think there was much \"remastering\" done, but it's probably as good as it's ever going to look.  There's also no mention of Blue Underground on the disc itself and no insert card. Makes you feel like you're really getting something \"taboo\" from the underground (blue?).  Of course, once the movie actually starts and you hear the atrocious dubbing and see the ridiculous action, all that scary reality is blown out the window.  This is anything but real.\nSince there are no extras and the movie itself seems to alienate most horror fans looking for gore or horrific thrills, this disc is really only for diehard exploitation fans especially considering it's high retail price.  Life is cheap but this DVD ain't.", "label": 2}

When I began using RedHat 9, I noticed that there were some lines going down the screen that made it uncomfortable to see what was going on or what you were doing.  I have to constantly reboot my computer once I log out to eliminate it.. still with that there are other small graphic problems.  According to one user, this problem is corrected using VESA as the default graphic card.\nBefore, with RedHat 8, it configured my Hauppage WinTV perfectly, and I could run XawTV without any kinds of problems.  This is not the case with RedHat 9.  The XawTV apparently is buggy or doesn't configure the TV Card correctly.  I had lots of trouble using XCDRoast which crashed constantly every time I tried to record some file in the CD-RW.  This also didn't happen with RedHat 8.\nAlso, there are some facts that for me are so surprising coming from RedHat, if they wish to maintain their status as the most popular GNU/Linux distribution.  First, during the installation procedure, RedHat 9 doesn't offer (yet!!) in its graphic installation the option of formatting the Hard Drive using ReiserFS filesystem.  You have to go to command prompt, and write \"mkreiserfs /dev/hdx\" where x is the number of the logical drive you want to format, then go again to the GUI and click \"Reset\" so that the ReiserFS format appears, and in the process of assigning \"root\", \"boot\", \"usr\", etc., you have to constantly tell the machine that you don't want to choose a format.  If you want multiple partitions, it is recommended to have it partitioned previously (Mandrake is good for that, and also Partition Magic) so you can format with ReiserFS more effectively.\nFurthermore, they didn't do the least effort to make it more user friendly, specially for those who use Winmodems.  It is incredible that a distribution like Lindows OS (for me, not a good distribution) in its most recent release included them, and RedHat has not included them in any way.  This will make the Linux users (specially beginners) to go through all the task of figuring out where to download the drivers, how to compile them and install them, and then configure the Winmodem so that it works (which for a beginner, it is a very tedious, frustrating and long process).\nI don't know what happened to RedHat people this time, but I don't think they made a good job doing this new release.  What happened was that I reinstalled RedHat Linux 8, and will stay with it until they release the next one (9.1 or the 10).\n ...  believe me, you won't regret it, and you won't miss RedHat in any way.  It is the best GNU/Linux distribution today.\n...", "label": 2}
{"text": "If you are really cheap or totally bankrupt when it comes to buying a set of productivity tools, here's a savior or option. This is really low-end software and I really don't recommend it, but it is commendable enough to do simple task such as typing a one-page document, adding numbers in the spreadsheet program. But the database is just not good at all. It's unreliable and not powerful to handle complex task such as creating complex queries or even reports. Works 8.0 cost forty dollars but if you have an extra thirty dollars, buy Star Office 7.0 instead, if you were to compare that to Works, Star Office would look more like Microsoft Office. Not much has changed since version 7.0, but the Wizards are more tasks intensive and focus on accomplishing your work more efficiently. The Task Center is much leaner and sleeker, but comparing it to prior versions, its not much a of a improvement. One of the great features of Works I always appreciate, is the pre-made templates that come bundled, you can't go wrong there, and to be honest its bit more intuitive compared to Star Office.\n\nStar Office is a full-featured productivity suite that includes a satisfactory word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation graphics and drawing program. The only time I can recall when I really, really appreciated Works was version 4.5, which was the ultimate Works; the Wizards were intuitive and easy to use. It guided you along the way; this really made Works friendlier and useful than recent versions. So, as I said before if you have the extra 30 dollars go for Star Office you won't regret it or just save and buy WordPerfect Office, WordPerfect Productivity Pack or Microsoft Office Teacher & Student Edition, a $150 value and you get four of Microsoft's major productivity applications, Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint, only problem with it, you can't upgrade to future versions of Office.", "label": 2}

Why did it take YEARS for that basic feature that more than half of QB users use for payments!?\n\n2. The support.  Ok, here we go:\n\nTo their credit, in 1999/2000 I made 3-4 calls to the call center for both technical and customer support related issues and was so impressed that I actually told others how good it was - and remember it today.

BUT... this was a call to the billing department to ask about a charge I didn't recognize!  I had my statement, card number, charge code, and amount in front of me.  AND THEY NEVER COULD HELP ME.  I hung up the phone without having my problem solved and disputed the charge with the Credit card company.\n\nThe charge dispute process took 7 minutes. Flat. Done.

I decided to try the upgrade as fewer and fewer things are ME compatible, and my computer was still working great.  My first try, I lost everything on my hard drive - you can't always restore to what you had, contrary to what the guide tells you.  I would say if you are going to do this, first do a fresh install of Windows ME, then install XP before any add on drivers.  The second try (with a fresh Windows ME install) went much better.  The only problem I had was that when I would go to stand-bye or hybernate, the system ended up having to recover from a serious error.  The problem was my video card - a Nvidia Riva TNT 64 (32MB).  It is not compatible with Windows XP, and none of the driver updates would help.  Other than that, things worked pretty well.\n\nI decided to install a different video card.  Found a used Winfast Geforce4 TI4200 (64MB) AGP video card on E-Bay for $14 with shipping.  I also decided to upgrade my RAM from 128 MB to 384 MB by adding 256 SDRAM ($25 new) in the open slot.  I had never even opened a case before, but the installation of each went very well (be sure to use a static strap).\n\nNow, I couldn't be happier with my computer, and the XP upgrade!  Since XP doesn't require anywhere near as much RAM as Vista to operate(1000 MB minimum rec.), 384 MB is very fast.  I'm actually planning on upping to the maximum I can of 512 MB RAM.  The system is now very stable - haven't had a single problem since the mods!  Surfing with multiple windows open while simultaneously synching my Zune, or listening to music is no problem!  I'm figuring that I should be able to get at least another few years out of my computer.\n\nI would say if you are thinking about doing the XP add on, first run a check ahead of time to see what compatibility issues you may have (Microsoft has a free on-line check).  It CAN be a great way to squeeze a few more years out of an older computer, but there may be some complications which take some time and effort to solve.

For how I use my computer, it is just as fast as most brand new computers!\n\nIt is probably a good idea to spend a few extra dollars, and get the stand-alone version, and not the upgrade to decrease the hassle, and likelihood of errors.\n\nI gave it three stars because of the initial compatibility problems.

I have put it to the side because it isn't fun, it is frustrating.  This is not due to the seller, but due to the designer who made the game.  Try some of the other Freddi Fish games.  We have one about The Haunted Schoolhouse one about The Case of The Stolen Conch Shell and a third about Missing Kelp Seeds.  Those aren't the exact titles, but you can find them doing a search with those words.  I highly recommend all 3 of those.  They are educational as well as fun.  In the Stolen Conch Shell game the maker designed it so there are different versions of the game on the same cd.  In other words, you can't memorize it because the clues change.  I like that one best.  The Haunted Schoolhouse also has a different version.  I think the Kelp Seed game only has one version on it...at least that's all we've played.  The other two games randomly change and you never know which set of clues you will get.\n\nThis is a good game to teach young kids (4 up to ?) how to use the mouse and get familiar with simple computer functions.  It is also a mental challenge.  An adult has to 'help' because a young kid won't know until they get old enough to figure it out for themselves.  It is good for the adult to interact because you get the opportunity to teach the child you love how to use a computer and it is fun doing it.", "label": 0}
{"text": "For the cost of about $40 and 12 hours of your time, you can pretty effectively learn Adobe's Dreamweaver CS5 at your own pace and location. It is not a DVD that you just pop into a DVD player to sit back and watch passively on TV. In fact, this DVD is only playable on the computer, because it requires you to use the mouse to select many of its options.  It's interactive and allows you to go to any and section as needed. At the end of each chapter, there is a test that you can take to see how well you have been learning.\n\nThere are 17 chapters and each chapter is divided into various sections. In the Training Content screen, which is the home screen when you play the DVD, each chapter and section has its heading clearly spelled out, so that you know where to go when you are looking for a particular video. It's the sections that you can click to play; the chapters are just \"folder names\" for organization purposes. Each section can vary from less than 3 minutes to more than 13 minutes long, depending on the complexity of the topic discussed. You can pause the video at any time, and there is captioning at the bottom of the screen to enhance your learning experience. The sub-titling is also valuable for non-English learners to help them understand what was spoken.\n\nIf you are a beginner, the best way to learn this program is to start from chapter 1, section 1 and proceed in order to the last chaper, because this video starts with the basics and progresses to more and more complex topics.\n\nCompared to classroom instruction, I prefer using this Learn by Video DVD because it is very well produced with the instructor speaking clearly and the contents well organized. You can learn at your pace, always go back to review any section, and there is no way you can take a classroom instruction course for $40.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I've owned Systemworks 2001 and 2002.  During 2003 my anti-virus subscription (a.k.a. symantec revenue stream) lapsed.  My employer had Symantec's corporate version of anti-virus licensed for use at work and in employee homes, so I removed SystemWorks 2002's anti-virus portion and installed the corporate version from my employer.\nWhen I bought SystemWorks 2004, I'd read the other reviews about the activation problems, but I did not have that problem.  Someone said this wouldn't install over an old version of SystemWorks, but it installed fine for me.  My problem was that after the installation, Live Update would always say I was fully up to date, even though I could see my virus definitions were 6 months old.  I tried emailing Norton's free support, but they only say they will respond in 4 to 5 days, which I didn't feel was acceptable, and I haven't heard yet even though it's been that long.\nI finally figured out that even though I'd removed the anti-virus from my employer before installing SW2004, after the installation the software was still going to the live update server at my employer for updates.  Something didn't sync up and instead of saying hmm, there's a problem here, and telling me, it would just say I was fully up to date.\nTo make this work I had to uninstall Systemworks entirely, then use a find to go through the registry and delete every entry for any Symantec or Norton item in the registry by hand.  After that, the install went fine, I had to re-activate the product, and it works fine.  I'm as happy with it as with previous versions of the software, except of course I feel the product activation is annoying and unnecessary.\nOne should never have to go manually clean their registry to get a product to work.  SystemWorks 2002 should have removed its entries.  Symantec's corporate anti-virus from my employer should have removed its entries, especially the live update target server.  But I had to do what the software products should have done automatically when they were uninstalled.\nSo I'm happy with SystemWorks 2004, but unhappy with Symantec in general for releasing products that don't actually, fully uninstall when you \"remove\" them.  There were dozens and dozens of leftover registry entries from SW2002 and corporate anti-virus to be removed by hand.", "label": 2}

Even resorting to running the 'program' from each of the seven disks separately (which means you can't search the entire collection for specific words or information anyway), it was painfully slow to load each page, or to even try to turn each page because it does two or three and then the 'program' invariably seizes up or crashes. And this on a brand new Macbook Pro. Fail! The text is UNSEARCHABLE because NG- unbelievably - scanned all those magazines improperly at such low quality and haven't, it seems, gone back to try to fix this root of so many problems.

For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating \"sorry for the inconvience\" and an option to send the error report to microsoft.

{"text": "Human Japanese has an elegant, yet simple user interface that walks users through a storybook of learning Japanese.  The lessons are simple, yet effective, and contain lots of cultural and lingual information one could only discover by living in Japan.  I'm teaching English in Japan, and I even learned things I hadn't realized yet.\n\nThe style of writing is warm and has a conversational tone that keeps me reading.  That's something I think is really important when learning by book or even software.  It reads like a really knowledgable and interesting....friend.  The easy-access reference on the side let's you look up translations without jumping out of the lesson.  That's really convenient.\n\nI've tried the declan software and the rosetta stone software and it's all about vocab and phrases or trying to make you remember the words through pictures.  Just reading the introduction chapter of Human Japanese really shows how much the makers of this software care personally about teaching the fundamentals of Japanese.  The other companies just make software for learning many languages to make money.\n\nAnd I've just got to mention:  all the Japanese words in the text can be clicked on to hear the pronounciation.  It's really nice.  Also, there is a customizable review game for Japanese numbers.  It's awesome.  The Japanese number system is pretty simple, but listening to big numbers in any language is a pain.  The game will generate random numbers in the range you want and read them in Japanese and quiz you.\n\nIf you are starting Japanese or if you want a really inexpensive software that helps you build some vocabulary and hear real Japanese pronounciation, this is it.", "label": 1}

I paid Microsoft for a 1 month subscription of Office 365 Home Premium, then purchased one of these 1 year subscription cards to extend my subscription for another year. That didn't work out as planned.\n\nI signed up for 1 month of Office 365 on 8/23/2014 with an expiration date of 9/23/2014. I applied this key card on 9/6/2014 and it showed an expiration date of 10/5/2015. What the heck?! Shouldn't it extend my subscription until 10/23/2015??? The short answer is NO.\n\nI contacted Microsoft support and had a very long chat with an agent before discovering that the key card I purchased was for a 1 year free TRIAL of Office 365. I had already purchased a 1 month subscription, and then started a TRIAL that would run concurrently with my paid subscription. The TRIAL does not extend a subscription. I reviewed the listing on Amazon and the packaging of the key card and did not find any indication that what I had purchased was a repacked TRIAL of Office 365, but that's what it is.\n\nThis key card probably works fine on its own if you're new to Office, but beware if you're looking to extend a subscription.

It's well thought-out, with interesting tidbits on how the Japanese language compares to English in terms of numbers of syllables, writing, how it evolved from its initial use of Chinese characters. Very interesting stuff. The tone is conversational, as if you were learning from a live teacher who also has a sense of humor. For example, here's an excerpt from chapter 3: Hiragana:\n\n\"If Japanese used only Hiragana and Katakana, it would be one of the simplest writing systems in the world. Alas, the picture is a bit more complicated than that. See, when Hiragana was invented, Chinese characters didn't just roll over and die. Keep in mind that Kanji were associated with wealth, power, and education. So for centuries, most of the people who had those things continued to write extensively in Kanji.\"\n\nIt's hard to be bored with stuff like that.\n\nI've tried using Pimsleur, but the repetitive, listening-only method doesn't work for me. After saying \"I understand/I don't understand\" 10 times in all its variations, I had to stop. And I was only in the middle of the first 20-or-so-minute less.\n\nHuman Japanese is different because it's engaging. You can click on words to hear the pronunciations, but you can see the romanized spelling of Japanese words and/or the kana and/or the kanji. This is what language-learning should entail--seeing, hearing, and speaking (which you do to yourself, of course). I only wish that Human Japanese had a recording function, like the \"Talk Now!\" series does, which allows you to record your pronunciation and play it back. Then you can determine whether your pronunciation is off or spot-on.\n\nI'll have to get to later chapters (or the end) to give a more detailed review.", "label": 1}

I'm a registered AppleWorks user, and registered the original Keynote and iWork '05 as well. The original Keynote was promising but mediocre. With iWork '05 Keynote was MUCH better, and Pages was disappointing. iWork '06 seems to bring many bug fixes and improvements which in my opinion should have been a free update. Once again, there has not been any upgrade path for previous users.\n\nThis will probably make my review \"not useful\" for many readers, but I will say that I'm happier with Microsoft Office 2004.

Office may be more expensive, but for me it has been a better value since it also includes Entourage and Excel, and it is a more useful tool that I use on a daily basis.\n\nFor people who are buying iWork for the first time, or only need presentation/word processing/layout software, it may be worth it.

{"text": "First, here's my bias: I think the BEST operating systems are transparent. They get out of the way, and when they appear, they do exactly what we tell them to do (within their limitations, naturally). Or, as one Linux distro says on its website: \"It is very important that you understand that choices are what makes xxxxxx run. We try not to force you onto anything you don't like. If you feel like we do, please bugreport it.\" This is diametrically opposed to Microsoft's philosophy. They seek to limit choices, hoping that eventually they will be the ONLY choice. Their products are ridiculously over-priced, and they seldom function as they should.\n\n Windows XP certainly fits this mold. It is the most stable incarnation of Windows I've ever used (going all the way back to Windows 3.1), but it's also the most limiting. For one thing, it's SLOW, even on reasonably fast systems. I'm running Windows 98 on an old 380MHz K6-2 laptop, and it's faster than Windows XP on a 2.8GHz Celeron laptop. While it took lots of tweaking to get Windows 95 and 98 to do what I wanted them to do, it was at least possible. With XP, parts of the system are completely inaccessible, even for simple, routine tasks. For instance, it's impossible to even complete a defrag of your hard drive under XP. The system files are locked in place, and cannot be moved.\n\n XP does offer a lot of functionality in some areas. It actually comes very close to being \"plug-and-play\". It is stable. Programs DO crash, but they generally don't crash the system. XP will set up partitions on your hard drive with very little effort on your part. And of course there is the real reason people use it: it runs the software that's written for it. It's also bound to be around at least until the Dept. of Justice sanctions on MS expire in 2007. Then they'll be back to their old antics.\n\n In short, if you like to have choices, make your own decisions, and believe you should be in control of your own computer system, Windows XP is not for you. If you like to let others choose for you, blindly trust authority figures, and believe that gigantic corporations always know best, then you'll love it. Personally I think they should call it, \"XP for Lemmings\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "I used this program as somewhat of a litmus test, in the sense that I didn't want to go ahead and spend a lot of money on a Japanese textbook before I knew if I could be capable of learning it. After my experience with Human Japanese I feel more confident to go forth with my studies, and spend a little more money on more advanced resources.\n\nMy biggest thing, is that I feel like I got my monies worth out of this product, unlike a lot of costly programs currently on the market. For 25 bucks you get 40 chapters of dense vocab and grammar notes, along with cute cultural notes. My only criticism would be that for certain chapters its difficult to remember the vocab with it just listed. For the body section for example, it would have been easier to understand it if he had some sort of body diagram and listed the parts on a picture of the body. I would have also been really happy if instead of listing the hiragana or katakana he showed the kanji of the word to the side, so I won't have to go back and re-learn them. Despite my nitpicks, I still enjoyed this unique program, and I would recommend it to others.\n\n(On a side note) After finishing Human Japanese, I felt confident enough to invest in an online textbook with a heftier price tag. I chose [...] which is specifically made for people teaching themselves Japanese. It helps in reviewing the basics, and has a fun innovative way to learn kanji. So that's my two cents, I hope it helped someone ^__^", "label": 1}

Operates like other Microsoft Office products, so for many of us, there's already an intuitive basis for understanding the program.\n**However, it is not intuitive how one is able to reduce the  size of one window within the program (example: your index.html file), and  open another concurrently (example: your style.css file) -- such as in MS  Word.\n2. Saves money by allowing users to create an entire Web-site  off-line, by being able to write coding and preview it all before uploading  it to the server.\nFrontPage incorporates Internet Explorer (IE) and  Netscape Navigator well so that, in conjuction with the above, previewing  for cross-browser compatibility becomes very easy.\n**However, no matter  how much tweaking I've done with FrontPage, the Opera 3.62 browser cannot  become one of the preview options along with IE and Netscape. (Maybe this  is Opera's problem?)\n3. Any program that will write the HTML for the user  (WYSIWYG) will always create some havoc, due to redundant and bloated  coding. And there might be some credence to the slant for FrontPage coding  to be supported by Microsoft's IE better than Netscape, but for those that  use FrontPage for testing out hand-written stuff, then it would be a decent  choice to use.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I could say a lot of good things and bad things about Windows. But when you're selecting system software, you don't need a technical assessment. You need to know whether it meets needs that you have. Since I'm reviewing the upgrade version I'll assume that you're running Windows 98, ME, or 2000K. Maybe 95, though a machine that old probably couldn't handle XP.\nSo, should you upgrade? The short answer is, probably not. Some things about XP are better, some are worse. On balance, XP is just a little more solid than its predecessors. But better enough to justify the cost and hassle of upgrading? Not by itself.\nIf you just love fancy eye candy, then I guess you have to upgrade. For my part, I find that stuff distracting, and when I get an XP system, the first thing I do is turn it off. Besides, a lot of it doesn't work with existing application software. Even some of the software that ships with XP, like some of the optional tool bars, don't support the new look-and-feel.\nAnd don't think of upgrading if your existing system isn't performing well with its existing version of Windows. XP makes more demands on the hardware, not less. If your system isn't up to your needs, then you need a new system. Which would include a full version of an Operating System. Should that OS be XP, or one of the alternatives (MacOS, Linux)? That's a subject for a separate review of the full version of XP. I may write that one soon.\nThe one solid reason I can think of for upgrading to XP is this: you have to run some fancy application that won't run what you currently have. That might be an issue if you're currently running Windows 98, since 98 and XP are really different operating systems. But if you're already running Windows 2000, I very much doubt you need to upgrade to XP to run anything.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was introduced to SmartDraw during my college years as part of a software class focused on object-oriented modeling.  The program has become so embedded into my professional career that I cannot think of being without it.  I have always maintained a license on my personal machine, but have gone so far as to purchase an additional license for a machine at my own expense to ensure that I'm also able to utilize the functionality at work.\n\nIf you're looking to diagram, chart, map, or make logical sense of ANYTHING, there's a template for it.  Comparing this program to Visio is doing it a disservice - SmartDraw goes beyond the simple diagramming available in Visio and allows you to actually use the software as part of a problem solving process.  SmartDraw has SO many templates available for you to use to kick off your thought process, and you can always modify them or just start from scratch as the mood suits you.\n\nFor those who would compare it to Visio, SmartDraw beats its Microsoft competitor hands down.  First of all, when you connect a line to something in SmartDraw, the program is intelligent enough to maintain that link even when you move things around.  Adding text, changing line formats, aligning objects, changing object shapes, and changing color schemes are 1-2 click functions (most of which are available from the right-click menu of a given object).  It's an intuitive program with limitless possibilities.\n\nThis program integrates seemlessly with MS Office applications.  As an example, if you have your PowerPoint presentation open and you have created an image or diagram in SmartDraw, there is a button at the top of the screen to \"send to PowerPoint\" which literally creates a new slide *in the file you are already working in* with your image in the center, waiting for you to add a title.\n\nThe customer service package that comes with SmartDraw is also exceptional.  Any time I've had a question or suggestion for a product enhancement, I receive a response within hours without detailed instructions on how to perform the functionality I was looking for, or a promise to forward the suggestion to the development team for a future release.  And since future releases and updates are always being pushed out with new templates and functionality, I have yet to be disappointed.\n\nThe ONE downside is sharing images to those who don't have the program.  However, as this same issue exists for Visio (which does a small fraction of the functionality and doesn't come with a built-in .pdf exporter), SmartDraw has and will remain my diagramming tool of choice.\n\nMost of the problems posted seem to result from having used the trial or older versions of the software.  As I've been using this product for at least 5 years, I will agree that past versions had issues opening files and weren't as versatile.  However, these complaints should be posted on the page for SmartDraw 2009; SmartDraw VP resolved these issues by incorporating functionality to push out continuous updates as new functionality emerged and/or issues were identified and resolved.  As for the people posting negative reviews after only using the trial version, these appear to be people who want to get the software without paying for it and are upset that the company limited functionality in the trial to prevent that from happening.  Unless you're reviewing the \"full package\", there's no way to understand or even be aware of the full potential of the software.  If you're willing to pay hundreds (if not thousands) for MS applications, this product is definitely worth the investment.", "label": 1}

There is very little personalization, very little choice in how the slide show plays out, but the pans and zooms are nicely done anyway.\n\nHere's where the trick comes in -- it's advertised or somehow implied that the Photo Story can be burned onto a DVD to operate on most DVD players. Exactly what I wanted, but that doesn't seem to be the actual case. Unless I'm wrong (that DOES happen on occasion) the Photo Story only seems to burn onto video CDs. Makes for a short televised story, sadly.\n\nSo that's the caveat. It's good software, easy to operate, burns digital files to CD or DVD for archiving and does this extra lovely thing that the Adobe Album doesn't do in the Photo Story. But only three stars for the DVD failure. Five stars if it's there and I've somehow missed it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Over the past few days I have been utilizing the Free Trial version of this software, typically for my drawings I use Visio which in some ways is more complicated to use, but in others makes much more sense.\n\nAs an example; the software by SmartDraw allows you to create a room via dimensions, but when those dimensions are not round numbers the software will automatically round up or round down creating the inability to totally decide what your actual space is. Another noticeable fact is that several of the pre-designed shapes such as Cubicles are poorly created. If you break them down into the individual components (un-grouping) they become misaligned requiring several more steps to make them appear correct. Additionally, lining up objects is a difficult task, each object wants to snap to grid, but for whatever reason the grid is different for each object. I can't wait to get Visio, just ordered moments ago.\n\nI would recommend staying away from this product.", "label": 0}

I only have to wait about ten seconds or less for it to get started up. Also its compatibility is brilliant. But, the things I don't like is that the task manager isn't as convenient as it has been. For instance, it takes up to a minute to end a hanging application. The alternative option is to end the process, which cuts things off immediatly, but why not just use that method instead of ending the application? Also, my younger sister sometimes switches user names and leaves herself logged on for no apparant reason. Well, knowing this is wasting up my precious memory space(and I mean precious, get at least 256mb of RAM, I have 512), I decided to log her of via the task manager. It took an extremely long time to log her off. Well, what I had to do then was to end all of her running processes myself, and then log her off. Someone tell me, why couldn't they just do that?\nAnd finally, the OS is not crash proof. Well, it doesn't have the major Blue Screen of Death crashes like WIN98 did, but apps freeze up a lot, mainly IE and OE. The OS still may be usable, but these apps come bundled with the OS, and should not be buggy.", "label": 2}

The installation manual and user support are the minimum necessary if your computer, your GPS, and the software all work in harmony. Any glitches, and you will probably have glitches, you will find yourself in agreement with the negative posters here. You would think that with a this keystone product Garmin would write a manual that deals with it specifically; instead what you get is a vague description of how things should work for all Garmin products. With nothing specific to this map set it is impossible to troubleshoot.\n\nSome posters here have been happy with the level of detail and have suggested that those who are dissatisfied are either unaware of how to use the product or unrealistic about what a 1:100000 map can provide. Perhaps the maps are better for regions I haven't looked at, but on the highest level of detail for Wisconsin I found the map inferior to what I could have drawn from memory. There are also many errors in an area that hasn't changed much over the last thirty years.

{"text": "ART sells two versions of this software: the \"suite\" version for about $99, and the \"pro\" version for $495. I bought the cheaper software and have regretted it. The most obvious problem for me is the inability to customize wall thicknesses and layers. My house has a concrete block wall on the first level, with a thick layer of stucco on the outside, and then a layer of insulation on the inside, covered with plywood, metal lathe and then plaster. There is simply no way to draw a wall like that in the basic version: you are stuck with a handful of basic wall types and no real ability to draw the wall layers. Reading their help pages revealed that this is a feature that ART deliberately removed from the suite version in order to force people to upgrade to pro...\n\nFor what it's worth, I've also tried 3D Home Architect Deluxe 6.0 and it seems to have the same problem. Very limited customization for walls. I couldn't even get a stucco finish on the exterior walls as far as I could tell.\n\nAnyway, despite my irritation at having forked out (...) for an unusable product, I figured I had no choice but to upgrade to the pro version. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there's no direct upgrade path, as far as I can see - to upgrade you have to fork out almost (...) for the Pro version and just throw away the earlier software. Oh yes, ART does offer a (...) rebate if you upgrade within 30 days, but this still leaves you $50 out of pocket. This rebate seems a little odd on their part, since they also offer a full money back guarantee within 30 days, which, needless to say, I am about to take advantage of.\n\nIn conclusion, I would jump either straight to the pro version, which seems to be a worthwhile piece of software according to reviews I've seen; or try something cheaper. 3DHA has a free trial that can be downloaded, and it'll give you a pretty good idea what's available in the suite version of Home Designer.", "label": 2}

It does sync to my handheld which is a plus for me since I travel a lot, and need all the help I can get keeping myself located.\n  However, on the down side, the route planner is of very little use.  Much of my traveling is on the west slope of Colorado.  I specified that I preferred to travel on interstate and main highways.  I quickly found the route planner taking me over mountain passes that are restricted to four wheel drive, and only passable five months a year when they are not covered with six feet of snow.  Had I not known the area, and had I traveled some of the specified routes, the situation would have not only extremely inconvenient, but possibly very dangerous as well.  I found that in many cases, the route planner only worked if I already knew the best way to travel, and mapped it out myself.

Now that I have more experience, my snooty Mac friends were right. Word really is a terrible product! As long as the only thing you need to do is place letters on a page one after another and want little control over any other aspect of producing a document, you'll be fine.

It's a nice feeling to know you can immerse yourself in a foreign language without leaving the comfort of your own bed to duck and hide from if it gets too scary for you. But can you truly learn what a meaning of a word is if it's in a huge sentence? So what anyone would do, or what I did, is when I was about to learn a new word I would write it down and look it up and all those new words I would study from with index cards. It worked but required me to do more work than what was advertised, but yet I still did it because I was committed on learning this language.\n\nHowever, it can certainly go over your head like you would not believe. One unit can be easy, another unit can have long sentences trying to trick you with pictures that can mean several different things. But, again, any language can do that.\n\nHowever you don't learn grammar such as tenses and structure, and Russian is quite confusing in that area.\n\nI think rosetta stone is good for languages with the same type of alphabet and structure of your native language. I try to continue to use the program so I don't think I bought the lovely $300 program in vain, but I constantly feel as if I'm drowning. I don't think this program will get you all the way if your learning by yourself. Also understand that the company advertises that you can learn a language all by yourself with this program, a nice advertising method that probably boosted their sales, I know that's why I bought it. Using the program and taking classes is probably the better idea. When I took French years ago our class would use Rosetta Stone now and again at the computer lab and it seemed to go quite smoothly.\n\nAt least I know when I move to Russia next year I'll have another study material I can use, but I am disappointed I wasn't able to learn by myself, but yet again some people need a classroom to learn languages, I guess I'm one of them. Still, I have to think I will use it or I'll get somewhat depressed over the cost of it.\n\nOne thing is I would definitely give this five stars if I was taking a class along with this program.

{"text": "GoBack is great! GoBack ain't-so-great! Pick one now, and you'll agree with the other choice later...\nI teach Quality Assurance Testing software for a living. I've been using GoBack to revert my drives after classes so I don't have to uh, go back and reset all the program options and databases.\nThree problems I've had with GoBack: 1) creating music CD's, 2) GoBack doesn't tell you how much free space you have remaining in its \"History\" before it starts overwriting older data.\nNumber three, you ask? A high potential for having to rebuild your entire operating system if you pick a \"System Safe Point\" and the GoBack fails.\nIf the point you attempt to revert to is more than six days old, you're probably in for a rude surprise. Pick a bad point, and you could doing a total rebuild of your system and all your software from scratch! Oh, and you'll find yourself wishing you'd made those back-ups you've been putting off.\nGoBack keeps a history. It can store up to 2 Gigabytes of sector changes. The list continues to grow, making you THINK you can still revert to way-back-when.\nGoBack lacks any form of \"Guage\" by which you can tell when you're close to running-out of room in the history space. The GoBack log still holds ALL of the human-readable history since the last time you cleared it.\nSo you pick a point to which you'd like to revert. GoBack reboots and then cranks, and cranks, and cranks. Looks good. Eighty-percent. Ninety percent. Then GoBack tells you something like: \"Gosh, golly, gee! We know it was in your list, but Buddy... we've lost the data and can not continue. Wanna try a different useless \"System Safe Point\" and see if it works? We can't tell you if it will, but go ahead, YOU make a guess and we'll give it another shot! Are ya feeling lucky, Kid?\"\nNot to mention that when I try to record an audio CD while GoBack is running, the resultant CD reminds one of the old days of vinyl records. Lots of clicks-and-pops. Hope you have a spare hard drive you can swap-in (sans GoBack) so you can make CD's. If you turn GoBack off to burn CD's, you lose ALL your \"history!\"\nNice idea, this GoBack-stuff. Great start for a \"Beta\" product. Poor \"Quality Control,\" lack of thought on important issues. And a false sense of security for the uninitiated user.\nTo it's credit: GoBack HAS allowed me to revert a file to what it looked like before I screwed it up (kind-of like Source Code Control without the expense). It's saved me time-and-again when a piece-of-crap software package I've installed has taken control of my system (e.g. ZoneAlarm Pro). It lets me see what files get changed when I do some specific task, or when I install a program.\nGoBack does have value.\nBuy it. Use it. DON'T trust it more than six days back.\nMake back-ups of all your important data. Frequently. Or at the very least: just before you attempt to Go Back.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As I am normally from the 'fly by the seat of your pants' school of finance, it seemed like a great idea to try to organize things.  So I purchased Money 2002.  After using it for about a month, I have just uninstalled it.  While it works well sometimes, it doesn't have the flexibility that I need and flat-out messes things up sometimes.\nI had some problems initially setting up all of my accounts and assets, and had to delete and start over occasionally.  I eventually did manage to get everything set up.  I found that the budgeting and investing tools did seem to work pretty well.  In my estimation, those are the high points of this package.\nThe credit card accounts seemed to have major problems.  I managed to get one of my cards' account working correctly, but the other was just plain wrong.  Even after downloading its information from the internet.\nThe main problem I had with this program is that, after downloading transactions from my bank for my checking account, Money would match them to the wrong transaction in my register.  This was particularly a problem with ATM withdrawals, but happened with checks as well.  Then it would not give you the option to change them, you could only click 'accept', even if you knew it was wrong.  Why even give me an option if it's my only option?  Once you clicked accept, because you had to, it would delete the original transaction you had in your register, subsequently messing up the entire account.\nThen, after the 1st of the year, I received a rebate from my 401(k) because I had over-contributed.  How in the world do I go back and reconcile that with last year's contributions that Money thinks I made?  I have no idea.  It's income that I received this year, but really just a rebate of income that I had last year.  And taxable now to boot.\nThis program might work well for people who have relatively simple finances, if they would fix the matching of downloaded transactions to what you've entered into the register.

The overall design is very nice, and it looks better than any other cookbook program that I've tried, and the recipes look delicious. Unfortunately, it's not the program to use if you have a lot of recipes to import. I've tried importing Meal-Master recipes, plain text recipes and even recipes exported then reimported by MasterCook 8, but even though the recipes get imported all of the categories disappear! Not only that, but there doesn't seem to be a standard set of categories for new cookbooks -- you have to make your own category template. Another big issue for me is eliminating duplicate recipes; MasterCook 8 checks for duplicates when you first import recipes, but there's no way to simply check for duplicates in a current cookbook.\n\nAll in all, if you don't have many recipes of your own and you aren't inclined to download thousands of new ones from the Internet the way I did then this is a good program.

{"text": "I may not be the typical user Pinnacle had in mind. I don't have a DV camcorder: my video comes from an analog video capture card. As such, the input files to Studio are MPEG1. My goal is to edit them and output either directly to VCD or another MPEG1 file.\nIn comparison to other products in the price range that I've tried (Ulead VisualStudio, MediaStudio Director, Extreme Media Digital Studio), Studio 8 is easier to use and offers features such as frame-level editing, scene detection and multiple clips per input file that the others don't. (The others might say they have frame-level editing and scene detection, but either don't have the controls for it -- a slider is not appropriate for frame control, and neither is hoping you hit pause at just the right time -- or only perform the function for certain inputs, such as DV.)\nI can't compare the rendering speed with the other products mentioned above, but it seemes comparable to the TMPGEnc encoder.\nThe version off the CD in the box would split the input MPEG file into scenes admirably, but the thumbnails for each clip were all messed up -- a correct thumbnail for one clip would also be assigned to the next dozen or so clips as well, and attempting to set your own thumbnails had no effect. Then when rendering MPEG output (VCD or file), the sound would drop out after half a minute or so and never come back. Installing the current released version from Pinnacle's website (8.3.18) fixed the thumbnail problem, but the audio problem remained. I then installed a beta version (8.5.8), and it fixed the audio problem, but the thumbnail problem was back and much of the output video was just a green screen. The way I've come up with to get correct MPEG output is to edit and render the video in 8.3.18, re-render in 8.5.8, and use TMPGEnc to multiplex the video from one file and the audio from the second into a third. The procedure works, but it is time consuming and requires two separate installations (most likely meaning two computers).\nPinnacle could also do seemingly little things to speed up Studio's editing. For instance, one unique feature is the ability to have multiple clips in a single source file -- the details being stored in scene (.scn) files. But apparently the thumbnails for each clip are not stored in the scene file meaning that the whole input file needs to be read when opening it in order to find the thumbnails.\nIf Pinnacle would fix the bugs and make some seemingly minor changes to speed the editing process, Studio would definitely rate five stars. As it is, at least for editing and rendering MPEG output, it's the best editor I've found for [the price], but it leaves a lot to be desired.", "label": 2}

I have an eMachines T1801 which I bought last August before all the hooplah about a new OS coming in late October.  The computer itself had 800Mhz, 128SDRAM, with a 20GB hard drive and a whole lot of nooks and crannys put together.\nI installed this new OS sensation that would sweep the nation last November, and come to find out that some of my programs won't work with Windows XP while doing the Compatibility Wizard - Namely:\nThe Philips 400Series CDR/RW USB Drive\n  (It's driver is not compatible)\nMy own language localizations, specifically my Russian and Japanese Language input systems, will not run properly and will require for me to get new software.  The Russian input system would not work since it's under its ME Platform.\nAnd, it seems that XP will install with no problems, but it's upgrade takes up much space.  I'm still stuck with the FAT file system on my hard drive; it won't install itself into a NTFS file system.  I was still stuck with both the XP and ME platform (maybe it's because of the upgrading and not the OS).  I don't know what else to say, but I will say this, I am so glad I got the XP upgrade software 'free' from the computer manufacturer.\nI have been through the same hocus-pocus when I had the Windows 3.1 back in '95.  Then came Win95, and I think it was the new wave of OS ((they had an upgrade too but (unlike XP's upgrade) it took up much space on my system and it would crash some, yet they recognized all software).  Then came Win98.  I think they were superior to 95 even though I had a real crappy computer from Packard Bell (a.k.a. Packard Hell) with a Cyrix MII processor. Then came Win2k, and along with it came WinME which was the mother of all computer nightmares with its 'blue screen of death'.  I rather not go to all the details and waste valuable online time with the whole story.  The rest - you can draw your conclusions.\nDon't get me wrong, I think Microsoft has done a superior job of this new system we call Windows XP.  It has the new features we had wish we had since the haydays of 95, 98, 2k and ME.  It has a striking, more colorful interface and it has so many potentials going for them.\nThe downside of it is that it is not so software and hardware friendly (all the way) that makes it even more unbearable, yet we will have to dread getting a new system pre-installed with it and still come up with some unexpected problems.  We as consumers should expect better that this.  We just can't keep buying new computers pre-installed with the next best thing.  I mean, can Mr. Gate$ understand that?  Maybe not!\nWhat really got to me was this new OS wasn't a launch for late August just like they did when Micro$ost launced Win95, 98, and 2k - but launched for October 25 (It doesn't make sense!). Why did we have to wait until late in the year of 2001 for something brand-spanking new?  Why waste a lot of time and money doing it the hard way (Trying an upgrade and not knowing what to expect)?\nAnd - I guess everyone will agree - but, WHAT'S UP WITH THE PRODUCT ACTIVATION CODE (WIZARD)???  M$ is cracking down piracy - and we ask ourselves why?  Hackers can get in anyway on any computer system you have and then we hear that the hackers about to nab XP.  Whether that's true or not, oh well... !\nI am opting to get another *sigh* computer system preloaded with this new beauty built in and keep my fingers crossed with the rest. For now, I will just stay with WinME and it's clinkety-clank of crashes!\nGOOD LUCK to all upgraders, you're GONNA NEED IT!", "label": 2}
{"text": "Something went terribly wrong at Microsoft in 2011-2012. Predicting that the entire globe would soon be replacing their desktops with touchscreen devices and monitors, Microsoft began designing its software with those users in mind. The best example, of course, is Windows 8, which welded together the traditional desktop experience with a metro UI that was minimally useful to desktop users focused on mouse-and-keyboard productivity. After a deluge of criticism, much of it deserved, Microsoft backtracked and began releasing updates to the OS that reintroduced features and options more suited to the desktop user (like the ability to boot straight to the desktop). Windows 8.1 was a big step in the right direction for those of us who use our computers for work rather than play, and Windows 10 promises to be an even bigger leap.\n\nThe problem is, Office 2013 -- which is the Office version that currently comes with the Office 365 subscription -- has the same problem as the initial Windows 8. Regardless of what the spokespeople at Microsoft will say, this office suite was designed with tablet users in mind. On a tablet, the Office 2013 experience is excellent, even elegantly simple and beautiful. Great new features, like synching office settings across multiple devices and greater integration with the OneDrive cloud (a service that I'm a huge fan of), add value. On a desktop, however, it delivers the equivalent of the experience that the metro interface of Windows 8 did. All of its aesthetic design strengths become weaknesses on a 22 inch non-touch monitor. It just seems clunky, out of place, and half baked.\n\nThe first thing professional users will notice is that there is an awful lot of white space in Outlook.  Things just seem bigger. And it's no accident: the scaling of the software was designed with high-dpi screens (like tablets) in mind. When using Outlook on a normal desktop monitor, you end up reading emails where the name of the sender is an unnaturally large font size. The calendar is no longer visible in the main inbox display, instead replaced by more white space and the aforementioned large font (again, something that makes sense on a higher-dpi display). In other words, everything seems out of proportion. Let me rephrase that -- everything IS out of proportion.\n\nWhat is worse is the rendering of the fonts. Although this is a problem that actually occurs on all of MS's native application programs in Windows 8. X, it is particularly annoying with Word. After all, I can easily install a different web browser to bypass Internet Explorer, but MS Word is a different beast entirely. In geek language, what MS did was opt to use grayscale font aliasing in these programs instead of the RGB font rendering of its older API. The result, once more, is a great experience on a tablet. On a desktop? Fonts seem just a tad blurry or hazy. Basically the result is that Office 2013 on a desktop gives you the same font experience you would have had if you had ever deselected the ClearType option on any sort of LCD panel running Windows in the 2000s.\n\nWhat to say about this piece of software then? Well, I uninstalled Office 2013 and reinstalled my old Office 2010. The problem with 2013 isn't that it does away with the Aeroglass appearance, which I like but am not particularly committed to. My problem is that it does away with it for all the wrong reasons: to create a better experience for tablet users. Yet the people most likely so sit down and work for extended periods of time with MS productivity software - like Office - are likely to be those NOT working on tablets, but instead working on good ol' fashioned mouse-and-keyboard systems.\n\nMS is fixing its mistakes with Windows 8. It's time they start doing the same with Office 2013, which seems to be fossilizing the mistakes that Windows 8 eliminated over a year ago. Until it does, I am sticking with Office 2010.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to update this to account for the fact that I have tried out Office 2016, and it has the exact same font issue that Office 2013 had. So if you subscribe to MS Office 365, and you have a nice desktop monitor, you'll be experiencing the same antedeluvian font rendering effects. Terrible. Wake up, Microsoft.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I own two copies of Studio8, two copies of Studio9, two copies of Studio9 Plus, and only one copy of Studio 10. Studio 9 Plus is the best way to go. After you apply latest patch and a new stable video card driver for you computer. Download direct-x and install that (even if you already have it installed). Studio 9 is buggy but it beats all the rest for features and ease of use. The program does install what seems like hundreds of special effects and add on that you can preview on your video but need to purchase separately in order to unlock them for use in creation of videos. Some start at $10 each and they go up up up from there. I have purchased some and liked the fact that you can buy only the ones you want, although I don't know if they are worth the money totally. The purchase of an add on effect nets you a machine and install specific serial number, no physical download. Pinnacle is worse than Microsoft for us power users that reformat hard drives or get new computers often. The entire software and all add on effects are machine specific and they even require a registration and activation to make a MPEGII video (DVD compatible video). The software sends a machine ID to Pinnacle so even after purchasing add on effects you can't use them again if you get a new computer or reformat your hard drive without jumping through hoops and begging them for a new serial number. Even that, I guess as I found out, is not even guaranteed and I personally am out all the money I paid for some add on effects after their system lost record of my add on effects purchases. Even though I have Studio 10, I still use Studio 9 plus instead. (To date I cannot get Studio 10 to work on any of my computers) In light of Pinnacle loosing my records for my add on effects purchases, and my inability to use those special effects again ever (even though I provided tech support with a receipt of purchase), I recommend Studio 9 Plus instead of Studio 10 but warn against any purchases for extras. Last note: Seems like tech support moved to India so those of us who don't speak that language can't really get any help there.", "label": 2}

I wasn't expecting too much from this game since it was made by nickelodeon and most of their stuff is [bad] that's thrown together in an hour tops.\nEven with my expectations set low, I was disappointed.  It didn't take me very long at all to beat the entire game..it is way too short.  The games are monotonous and you must beat one to get the next.  There are three levels in every game, and the last one takes a good 5 tries to beat sometimes, which is frustrating.\nThis game may be ok for an 8-11 year old but not much younger because you have to have a decent attention span to keep interest long enough to beat the levels, although I'm sure there are cheat codes somewhere on the internet to unlock all of the games at once.\nThe graphics were pretty bad--the characters didn't look right and the pixels were big, meaning the graphics weren't very sharp.  The voices didn't sound anywhere near close to what the characters really sound like either.\nThe reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because of course I love spongebob and some of the games were cute and entertaining for a bit.  Plus, like I said earlier, it would be much better for younger kids...depending on what their attention span is like.\nIt was only about an hours worth of mild entertainment and definately not worth [the  money].", "label": 0}

{"text": "The price alone is what makes this product a rip-off. On it's own, Rosetta Stone is great...I mean, it's probably one of the most effective and easily accessible vocabulary learning tools on the market. However, the value of this package is not more than...60-70 bucks. 150 is a fair price for the entire 2 level package.\n\nThe program lacks grammar explanations, and more importantly, it lacks conversational lessons. There is one actual lesson that briefly covers some casual speak, but the majority of the program is just vocabulary.  After going through the entire 150 dollar first level, you still won't know how to say \"Hallo, wie geht's?\"--\"Ah, es geht mir gut\". I haven't completed the entire program, but I have skimmed it all, and I don't believe you ever learn conversational things like that.\n\nIn order for this program to even near the pricetag that they've put on it...it would need some type of grammar explanation...like perhaps a reading after each chapter or unit that would explain why things are done the way they are. It also needs several more units that intensely cover conversational things.  The cheaper products out there like Instant Immersion do a MUCH better job of giving you conversational language.\n\nAnyways, I'd reccommend...not paying for this. I managed to get a hold of it for free, and I'm glad. I once was at a booth at a mall where they tried to sell it to me, and I'm glad I wasn't suckered in. It's not a bad concept of a program, and as a program itself it is excellent. The price is unfortunately why it is bad. Borrow it from a friend, or acquire it some other way.\n\nI would recommend in lieu of this program Pimsleur (don't pay for that either, rent it, or look on ebay), Instant Immersion (worth the full price of 40ish), and just a good internet connection.

Many people complain their street isn't shown or recent construction isn't shown, but it takes about 3 years for new mapping data to make it all the way from satellite imagery, to purchasable data for companies like Microsoft to obtain, and then into their finalized product.  So, if that new road, neighborhood, etc. has been there less than 3 years, then you really cannot expect it to be in Pocket Streets.\n\nIf you purchase the full desktop version of Microsoft Streets and Trips then you're given the option to install the Microsoft Pocket Streets 2005 during installation of the full version.  So, unless you ONLY want Pocket Streets, you're better off buying the full desktop version and installing it on your Pocket PC that way.

And there are many such pictures. Hopefully they will come up with an upgrade soon to fix this, as they have received many queries about this.\n\nAlthough there are some negatives, overall, I am very happy with this set.\n\nThe huge plus is you get every issue of National Geographic in a relatively easily readable format when you use the easy-to-use magnifying and dragging features. If you have a 24\" monitor, it's pretty readable as is. With magnified reading, when you go to the next page, it resets back to zero magnification, and you have to re-magnify it. But it's fairly easy -- all you have to do is double click on the page, and it magnifies, and you can drag the text and pictures around as needed.\n\nThey even include all of the advertisements, which they could have easily decided to omit. (It's fun to look at the ads from long ago. For example, in the April 1916 issue, focusing on the national parks, there's an ad for newly established Cascade National Park, placed by Great Northern Railroad, reminiscent of the days when railroads affiliated themselves with different parks, to boost travel.)\n\nIt prints out beautifully, and there is no readability problem with printouts.\n\nThere is a handy readlist feature, where you can create your own readlists (very easily done) or look at readlists that the editors have prepared. There are approximately 33 of these already created readlists, covering such things as various editors' favorites, National Parks, The Universe, The Untamed, etc. Just scanning through these articles, it looks like these lists are pretty good and I see a lot of things I want to read.\n\nOne problem with these readlists is that they don't give the date of the article. You see something focusing on, say India, and you have no idea if it is from 1915 or 2005. That makes a big difference to me insofar as my interest. They should include the date of the issue in these readlists. When I create my own lists I plan on always including the date.\n\nAll in all, I am happy with this set, and would buy again, since it seems to be the best way to get all of national Geographic, short of buying all of the actual magazines for thousands of dollars.", "label": 1}

When I tried to cancel my unwanted subscription I was told that WSJ Online would not give any refunds.  Interestingly, the online \"Help\" chat lady said they cant cancel a subscription and gave me an 800 number that seemed to go to India and I couldn't understand her nor could she understand me.  We spelled to each other only to find out she couldn't cancel.  Transfer -- wait -- back to original saying they're not in in cancellation so she will do it.  But I don't think she did.  I just have to call Visa and dispute the charge.  Stinks", "label": 0}

I upgrade to 5 only to find that ECDC 5 seems to be designed primarily to cause blue screens in Windows 2000.

{"text": "I have used most of Microsoft's operating systems released since 1995 (95A, 95B, NT, 98, 98SE, 2000, and XP), and Windows 98SE seems to have the most bugs.  I have installed Win 98SE on about 6 different computers, and have had one or more of the following difficulties on each machine:\n\n1) I was already having problems while installing it.  For example, when the installation was 99% complete (i.e. after almost an hour of hard work!), it gave me a \"Windows protection\" error, which prevented the computer from starting up.  It took me a while to figure out how to get around that.\n\n2) When I installed other programs, I sometimes got error messages at the end of installation, though the programs seemed to run okay afterward.\n\n3) When I run many programs simultaneously, the computer crashes easily.\n\n4) About 4 out of 10 times I shut down the computer, it freezes and I have to turn it off by pressing the power button!\n\nThus, if your computer can support Win 2000 or XP (i.e. if it's fast enough and the hard drive has enough space), avoid 98SE at all cost!  Not only Win 2000/XP rarely have the above problems, but some of the latest software (e.g. Microsoft Office 2003) requires at least Win 2000 and won't run on 98/98SE.  In addition, if I am not mistaken, only Win 2000 Service Pack 4 or Win XP Service Pack 1 or 2 can natively support hard drives bigger than 137 GB.  Another (minor) inconvenience is that for hard drives between 64 and 137 GB, you need to get a special, free update from Microsoft if you want Windows 98/98SE to recognize the full capacity of the drive.\n\nHowever, if you must use either Win 98 or 98SE, Win 98SE is the better choice because certain programs are supported only by the former but not the latter, e.g. Acrobat Reader 6 and Windows Media Player 9, and many USB devices I have used are supported by 98SE but not by 98.", "label": 0}

{"text": "A comprehensive list of pros and cons for I Spy : Spooky Mansion:\nPros: 1. You can enter your name in the beginning of the game to \"register\" and your name becomes incorporated into the clues. 2. In the study, you can create your own riddles which you can then print out. Great for kids who like to create or like poetry. 3. You can stop and save your game along the way - an especially nice feature for kids with short attention spans or parents who want to limit the amount of computer time and don't want to hear the standard, \"let me just finish this board...\". 4. The riddles vary in difficulty.  A young child may need more help than an older one (good family OR independant activity). The butterfly puzzle is especially difficult - as an adult, even *I* had to ask my husband for help on one! 5. Each room varies so much from the others and not all of the puzzles are the same format.  That really keeps kids' attention. 6. The clues appear in text at the bottom of the screen for easy reference.  Also, the clues are \"read aloud\" when you first enter the room.  This feature is great for kids who are learning to read. 7.  There are trick questions all over the place.  Buy the game and see what I mean! (If I gave an example, they wouldn't be trick questions anymore *wink*).\nCons:  I really only have one complaint about this program.  Unfortunately, it is big enough where an otherwise amazing game is bumped down to three stars because of it's one major flaw: Despite what the box says, you won't want to replay this game once you are done; Unless, of course, you let it sit on your shelf for long enough to forget the clues and the locations of the items you have to find.  You are given two sets of clues for each room and they do not reset themselves once you have finished the game.

{"text": "Norton Anti-Virus is one of those things you would love to do without but in the end can never really do without. I have been a Norton user since SystemWorks 2003 and now NAV 2005. Despite some reviews you might read, yes, it does work. Is it slow? Yes. Is it more than slightly at odds with Windows XP? Yes? But does it work yes.\n\nI upgraded to NAV 2005 after it became a hassle to renew my subscription for NAV 2003 (since older versions did not come with a serial number that you now must supply LiveUpdate you have to call in to Symantec everytime you need to renew your subscription). NAV 2005 installed fine and with not a horror story in sight.\n\nPros: It is Anti-Virus protection that, if you run Windows, you do need. The scanning seems a bit faster than in NAV 2003. The Quick Scan and Worm Protector are good additions. Worm Protector is a lot late in-coming from the \"Leader\" in security software, and isn't that neccessary if you run a halfway decent Firewall. But still it is welcome.\n\nCons: Yes, there is a performance hit. If you have a computer newer than two years old than you shouldn't notice it that much however. The thing is that despite what other reviews say both MAcfee and PC-Cillian use the same amount of PC resources as NAV (Check it out on Cnet if you don't believe me).  All three are slow, lumbering, bloated oxes of software but they are also what you have to work with. The new serial number and Activation system (modeled on the one that Windows XP and MS Office use) is very annoying if you have more than one PC and is annoying in general because it is one more serial number to keep track of. You can sort of understand Symantec's thinking since their products are the most pirated on the web but I think the whole Activation system could have been handled better and you should have been able to installed NAV on at least two machines.\n\nThings That Really, Really bother Me: First and foremost, when you first install NAV 2005 you get prompts to disable your software firewall and instead rely on NAV Worm Protection. While the Worm Protection program is useful, its not nearly as effective as a good software firewall, even Windows' built-in firewall. While it may protect against worms, Worm Protection leaves a person's computer wide open to all forms of hacker attacks. Also you have various prompts to block Windows new Security center from monitoring your Anti-Virus programs. This was one of the few things Microsoft has done right in a Windows Service Pack in a long time, and Symantec is trying to subvert it. Symantec seriously needs to focus on making NAV more compatible with Windows XP, not less, or it makes everyone's computers less secure.\n\nBottom Line: Yep, Symantec's NAV 2005 has become bloated and a resource hog over the years, but it is still the best you can get when it comes to a reliable anti-virus protection. That in itself is a sad statement. Until Microsoft builds a decent Anti-virus system into the next version of Windows  its as good as it gets.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have been a fan of Oregon Trail for many years. It is therefore with great pain that I say the following: Don't buy this game.\n  Oregon Trail 5 is not a new game. The programmers of Oregon Trail 5, whether from lack of funding or laziness, took 1996 vintage Oregon Trail 2 and rereleased it with minor changes (which I will describe below.) That's it.\n  Let me repeat, because this is important. THIS IS OREGON TRAIL 2 FROM 1996 IN A NEW BOX. Oregon Trail 2 was not a bad game for 1996. But times have changed, and today it is a nightmare. The graphics are terrible messes of blurry colored dots (1996 vintage, remember?) and the actual gameplay is just \"click the button to go on\" and allows no real creativity. The only changes that have been made are for the worse. The varied and enjoyable western soundtrack of Oregon Trail 2 has been changed to a single 30 second long cliche'd song that constantly loops. A few new videos are added that are poorly animated, employ worser voice actors, and add nothing to the game. In fact, they are quite jarring, as they interrupt whatever you were doing with no warning. A poorly-done fishing mini-game has also been added. And as a bonus, numerous bugs have been introduced: save often, or you might find your progress lost when the game crashes on you. Remember, Oregon Trail 2 was written for Windows 3.1, not Windows XP and Windows Vista, and a rerelease doesn't change the fact that it simply isn't made to run on modern computers. It doesn't even run well on a Windows 95 or 98 system, despite the game's claim that it should.\n  Save yourself much hassle and annoyance. This game is not worth getting.
