{"text": "An incredible product.  Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have.  The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users.  That alone is worth $100 a year.  You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.\n\nYet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets).  This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office.  For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done.  Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way.  If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products.  Office 365 protects you against that.  It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever.\n\nOne last feature is the stackability of the subscription.  There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere.  Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80.  You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions.  Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription.  This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage.\n\nThis is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Background on my use of Garmin products: First, let me say that I have been VERY HAPPY with my Garmin GPSMap 60CSx and using the CitySelect North America road maps for driving directions, finding restaurants, driving to a manually entered address, etc. I had been using them for 12 months when I got ready to leave on a trip to Europe for business.\n\n  Why did I start shopping for this product? Before I left on my trip, I had a hard time deciding if it would be worth the $350 to get the Europe MapSource. In addition to stops in the UK and Spain, we were scheduled to visit somewhere in Africa, too. We would only be in each country for a couple of weeks, so I didn't think it would be worth spending the money on the European MapSource.\n\n  Why did I end up buying this product? As a compromise, I thought this World Map (I bought version 3.02) would at least give me the base map and major roads and highways. My expectation was that it would not have anywhere near as much data or detail in it as the North America MapSource, but I expected what data it DID have would be ACCURATE. Boy was I wrong.\n\n  Where and how long did I spend evaluating this product overseas? I spent one week in England, driving to and from London and Plymouth. I spent three weeks in Rota, Spain (near Cadiz / southwest of Seville). Our trip to Africa was canceled, so we got to spend a glorious week in Lisbon, Portugal instead.\n\n  What were my observations about this World Map? As I stated before, I expected that the things that were in there would at least be plotted correctly / accurately. I expected that with the GPS at least showing me where I was in relation to major landmarks and holding a paper map in my hand, I would be able to have a general feel for where I was on the paper map. It was not so.\n\n  In the places I visited (UK, Spain, Portugal), it was extremely inaccurate. For example, I would be a quarter mile on the NW side of the Thames river, and it would show me as being a quarter mile SE of the Thames river.\n\n  The major highways it does show are not labeled the same as they are labeled when you are driving around. This was particularly frustrating in Spain. I would try finding street signs that would lead me to a major highway labeled as one thing on the GPS, but I would never find any signs with the same label as on the GPS, because they use totally different names.\n\n  In summary, the geographic positions of what is included in this world map are significantly off and inaccurate, and the labels on the major highways don't match the actual names on the highways in the UK, Spain, and Portugal.\n\n  In hindsight, I wish I would have either spent the extra money on the European MapSource, or just saved the money and not bought anything at all.  This was a total waste.", "label": 0}
{"text": "XP is clearly the best version of Windows yet. I now leave my PC on continously, just using the standby mode rather than shutting the PC down. You can monitor free memory and it does not disappear over time like in all the 9x versions. I noticed improved performance in some of my applications compared to ME. No shut-down problems like there were in 98. Some applications that would not run for me in ME now run fine in XP.\nHaving said that, it still does not seem to be \"rock\" stable. I had a problem that required me to reinstall. Still not sure what the problem was. Spent 1/2 on hold to get Microsoft support (no charge for support, but not an 800 number either). Was able to recover my data, but significant waste of time.\nAlso, going from Windows ME with Roxio (nee Adaptec) CD Creator s/w to XP you lose some functionality. XP now incorporates CD burning into the operating system so you don't need the Roxio software. But you don't get the ability to treat the CD-RW like a regular floppy drive like you did with the DirectCD feature of the Roxio software. I thought about spending the money for the Roxio upgrade but the reviews of the XP version of the product were not good.\nYou should also keep in mind other upgrade costs. For me, I had enough memory so that was not an issue. But I did have to upgrade my Norton Antivirus software (~$...). And if you want the full CD-RW features with Adaptec/Roxio count on another $(...).\nFinally, I have to say that I don't think too much of Microsoft as a company. The price for this product is too high, considering it is what Windows 98 should have been. Given that we have already paid for 98, shouldn't the upgrade to make it what it should have been in the first place had a price tag more in the 30 to 40 dollar range? But if you want a version of windows that runs reasonably well, your only choice is to pay MS the $(...) for this upgrade.", "label": 2}

We had trouble getting the game installed on Win ME (see the other review) so we reformatted the computer and reinstalled Win98 but still had no luck.  We met the game requirements and had typical hardware (nvidia video, sound blaster sound) on a Gateway desktop.  We \"worked\" with the maker's tech support group and never got the problem resolved in over a month.  The support was terrible.  You can't get through on the phone (a long distance call), the fax number in the game pamphlet is wrong and it took them a week or 10 days to respond via email. There's nothing meaningful in their on-line support areas and there's not contact info either. You're left with one of the 3 options above.  Actually support was ok at the initial level (courteous and quick) but once it was \"elevated\" for resolution the problems started it.  Our problem was probably either a hardware issue but they couldn't figure it out (or never really tried?). Too bad though.  My son plays the game at school and really liked it.

However, I found its reference to be subjective.  I decided to start reading from 1 John and was immediately disappointed to read that the reference notes specifically explained 1 John chapter 1 with the presumption of the doctrine of original sin and the sinful nature of the flesh and penal substitution.  All of these are doctrines that are still heavily debated within the Christian circles (see Calvinism debate). This was obvious that the reference notes in this bible would not only promotes an eisegetic study of the scriptures but the eisegetic ideas of Calvinism.  I would not recommend this study bible for a Christian with a sincere heart to study the Word of God with the spirit to discover Spirit-lead truths.  If you are familiar with scriptures and various opposing Christian doctrines and understand your ability to discern as you read other reference notes, you may use this study bible as a resource for such doctrinal notes.

The download / upload process was relatively pain free and reasonably fast. There is no need to delete the existing maps in the unit before loading a new map in - your upload simply writes over the current maps.\n\n3 - The only bugs I noticed have to do with getting at the underlying directions for Routes you create. I found that selecting the route did not always work, but that clicking on the route on the map and then clicking on Properties to get to the Directions solved the problem.\n\n4 - The turn-by-turn directions were mostly spot on. However there were some places in Italy where I ran in to areas that were recently / currently under construction and in these areas, some wrong turns were indicated. The most useful feature in these circumstances was the automatic recalculation for directions.\n\n5 - When you zoom in to a quarter mile radius, the location of restaurants, local attractions, etc show up with useful symbols, sometimes with amusing results. Outside the door of our hotel in Florence I turned on the unit and saw no fewer than 15 pizza symbols (pizzerias) within 2 blocks of our hotel.\n\nNow on to the cons\n\n6 - The Route function does not seem to work as advertised. You are supposed to be able to create a Route between two or more points on your computer and then download them to your device. The only problem is that the Route only works if you also include ALL of the map segments between the points. With a 64 MB limit on my device, this was often impossible. The result is that I had to download subsets of the map segments for my drive from Parma to Paris and then create routes for segments of the drive. If I did not have my laptop with me, I would have been out of luck.\n\nA couple of suggestions for version 9. Please break up some of the larger areas into smaller maps. On the segment from Geneva to Paris, I passed through the very northwest corner of one map segment for maybe 15 miles. However I had to load the ENTIRE 6 MB segment in to memory. Alternatively, if the Route function can allow you to load in only the portion of the segment you will drive through, I would be VERY happy.\n\nAlso, I was shocked to find that the toll through the Mont Blanc tunnel was 39 euros. There were also numerous other tolls along the way from Parma to Paris - totaling over 115 euros. It would be nice to know this in advance to allow for planning purposes. Considering the fact that thousands of pizzerias are pre-loaded, information about toll roads doesn't seem like too much to ask for.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As a network administrator for a large firm using UNIX, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows NT, I have been watching the development of XP for some time. I have used the RC candidates at home and in our network environment in order to better understand how this could influence our networking efficiency, security, and stability.\nKeep in mind these opinions are based on release candidates, and are therefore not necessarily indicative of behaviors in the official product release. That being said, there are some interesting features I would like to note:\n1). Security: nmap, other scanning software, and rudimentary penetration tests performed at our network facility seem to indicate a greater security risk from outside attacks than Windows 2k (both were tested \"out-of-the-box\"). Once the Internet Connection Firewall was enabled and configured correctly, this greatly reduced the amount of incoming traffic that could be allowed, but the product still failed many of the less-standard port scans. We also logged several interesting outgoing port calls from XP through our OpenBSD/IPFilter firewall, the nature of which we could not determine (most were UDP, but there several port calls to TCP ports < 1024). So, while the built-in firewall does offer more protection than win2k, it is still quite insufficient by itself. NAT seemed to be standard, though port redirects were not possible in either RC.\n2). GUI: To put it simply, I am not pleased with the GUI. People have said this operating system is the combination of Mac OS and win2k. Obviously these people are not aware of the underlying architecture of Mac OS (especially the Mac OS X and 10.1 graphics engine), but that's not the issue here. What I dislike about the GUI (besides the design, of course), is it's now harder than ever to probe into what is really going on in the innards of the beast. This latest release has effectively hidden all but the barest of system calls rendering technical support a real nasty affair. No doubt MS technical support will have plenty of KB articles on how to troubleshoot issues hidden behind the new GUI, but that will be some time in coming.\n3). Cost: Based on the points above (and many more that are more or less negligible and circumstance-dependent), I would not recommend Windows XP professional over Windows 2000 professional. If it were a free upgrade or of minimal cost, I could see certain IT departments migrating to XP, but overall, the expense of even upgrading a few machines is a hefty price to pay for what looks to be a moderately useful upgrade. In other words, users will not be more productive, more secure, and happier (unless they're fans of the GUI). They will not buy the IT dept. cake or throw a party, and the IT department will not be throwing a party either. At least none of us did.\nI *would*, however, recommend this product to users of Windows ME (quite the worst OS MS has put out since win3.x), especially if you're fond of ME.", "label": 0}
{"text": "As the head of the IT support desk for a large contractor, to the government, I have to find software that will reduce downtime, fix errors and keep pc user's machine up and running.\n\n I bought a full version of this product. [The Pro version].\n\n To evaluate it's performance and abilities.\n\n In my opinion;\n\n I give it a [3-Star] \"middle-of-the-road\" score, as far as a \"packaged\" s/w utility goes.\n\n This was neither a 5-Star, \"miracle\" s/w package, nor was it a 1-Star \"total flop\".\n\n I could go on and give a dissertation, but let me just touch on a few select topics.\n\n 1. Anti-Spyware - I have 4 full version packages in my personal arsenal [home pc, not at work]. And STILL, if I run all 4 anti-spyware packages, each one will find something that the others don't.\n\n My picks are:\n\n a. Spysweeper [new V3.0 has a few new, cool upgrades over it's prior version, 2.x version]\n\n b. Pestpatrol [also Spyware X-terminator, apparently licensed to STOMP INC but appears to use the Pestpatrol engine]\n\n c. Mcafee Anti-spyware\n\n d. X cleaner - I like this as an overall bundle-of-utilities better that for it's abilities as an in-depth anti-spyware, though it has been getting better.\n\n 2. Anti-virus and firewall - I have used either Norton AV alone, or as part of a Norton \"bundle\". This would be my first choice. Mcafee NAV probably 2nd.\n\n I have not been very happy with Panda, as an anti-virus\n\n w/ firewall. I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but it has a tendency in my experience to suck-the-life out of my pc. [Which is a 3 GHz with 1 gig ram.]\n\n Bit-defender's demo worked quite well. It is an AV product only [I believe]. something to look at as a anti-virus product.\n\n 3. Utility suites - I have used Norton systemworks since 2000, along with the prior version of Norton utilities\n\n for both PCs and MACs.\n\n I normally use Norton Systemworks. A second choice would be V-COM's Systemsuite 5.0.\n\n The only downside of Systemsuite 5 is that it's \"disk fixer\" product often just seems to throw up it's hands and tells you to manually invoke the CHKDSK utility to repair disk errors.\n\n My suggestions:\n\n 1. look for TRIAL software from places like Norton [Symantec], PC-Cillin Trend Micro, Mcafee, Bit defender, V-COM, Iolo, Panda.\n\n 2. Always be a bit suspect of reviews [on any product here on AMAZON] that simply say general, non-commitive\n\n terms like \"It bites\", \"No good\", \"useless\".\n\n I give much more credibility to reviews that cover, WHO, WHAT, HOW, WHY, WHEN.\n\n Why is something good or bad? What does it do that is good or bad? How is it better or worse than other products?\n\n Why would I recommend or not recommend it? Based on what? When [under what circumstances]\n\n Did it perform good or poor?\n\n Just my .02 cents.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This review is written from the point of view of someone who does not use the online features of Quicken.  I'm sure those features have value, but if you want to use them I recommend you find a reviewer who can tell you about them.  If like me you just use Quicken to record your financial transactions then read on.\nThe fundamentals of Quicken haven't changed much between this version and 1999, which was the previous version I used.  However, I think users of older versions will find this one irritating in several ways.  First, Quicken tries very hard to make all your accounts online.  This means that you can't create an account that does not refer to an online institution without a bit of extra trouble; and once you've created the account, every time you try to reconcile, it wants you to download information from the web.  If you're tracking the downloaded information in any other way, as I am, this is just an irritant.\nA second irritation is that once you do set up an account online, you are forced to change your password for each account.  I actually agree that this is good security practice, but the user should be notified ahead of time that this will happen.\nThe screen area devoted to the actual Quicken layout is smaller.  Much of the extra area is devoted to what are essentially advertisements for more Quicken products and functionality.  With a bit of work I was able to figure out how to increase the area displaying transactions, but it's still less than it used to be.\nThe old tabbed layout, with right hand tabs for open accounts, has been changed to a left hand menu that is not shrinkable beyond a certain point.  The bottom inch of the screen is reserved for clickable icons for your online accounts; this menu can't be removed -- a tremendous irritation as I never use it.  There is no way to mark an account as \"not an online account any more\".\nReconciling is much as before, but the old facility whereby a carriage return would mark a transaction as reconciled and also move you down a line is gone.  This is the single most annoying change for me; it more than doubles the time it takes to reconcile.\nOverall, Quicken is a wonderful program, and I strongly recommend it -- it does great things and will save you time.  But this version is, for me at least, a real step backwards.  If, like me, you don't plan to use the fancy online features, I would recommend buying an older version if you have confidence it will run on your computer.", "label": 2}

{"text": "MS Streets and Trips was very unsatisfactory for planning a trip to the desert southwest this summer.  First, an admission.  I often work with a professional mapping program (GIS) so my expectations are probably a little high.  I bought MS S&T because I didn't have the appropriate data for the GIS to make maps of the area (I live elsewhere).  I thought S&T might work and I was interested in its ability to prepare maps for the Web.\nThe major problem I had with MS S&T is that the maps didn't provide enough information at a useful map size (scale) for the \"wide open spaces\" I intend to visit.  Many times the objects might be there but they would only appear if you zoomed in enough.  By then, the map was so zoomed in that you lost all sense of the lay of the land.  For example, imagine that you found a campground in a national park, but you had to drag the map five or ten screens across to find the park entrance.  By that time you have only a vague sense where the campground was.  If you try to zoom out to get an overview, the campground (and probably the entrance station) disappear from the map.\nThere is no control whatsoever over when a object or type of object appears on a map.  It's also difficult to put labels on.  And natural features aren't very well represented in general.  On the plus side, the program lets you import and plot locations by their latitude and longitude.  I was able to overcome the scarcity of data by downloading a data set that provides all the landmarks on USGS topo maps and gives their lat/longs (search for GNIS if you're interested).\nThis program apparently was intended almost entirely for trips to urban areas, and for that purpose I offer no opinion.

{"text": "I bought this program so that I can plot road bike routes and generate elevation profiles of those routes. The Back Roads Explorer does that well if the route is entered by tracing on the map with the mouse. The profiles are generated well and there is a link from the profile back to the map; clicking on the profile will put a marker on the map route, which will tell you where to expect that big climb. Map and elevation profile can then be exported to an image (JPG, GIF, etc.) file or printed out or stored to a PDA. Beware, there is no way to automatically generate directions from the route.\n\nOne of the reasons for a three-star rating is that the CD media was somehow incompatible with my CD drive. It took several tries just to install the program. After that it would take a very long time to load data from map CDs. The program would sometimes freeze and had to be restarted. It would freeze 100% of the time if my route required data CDs to be switched. To fix this I had to copy National Geographic CDs to the hard drive (which took multiple attempts because of CD read errors) and burn it on CDR media.\n\nAnother reason for three stars is that the GPS route import is very rudimentary. It may work better when the GPS unit is connected directly to the computer (I haven't tried), but only text file format is supported by file import tool.

So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version.

{"text": "Money 2006 Premium was essentially purchased to manage portfolio investments in stocks. This is the first time I have used Money and find that it has some major problems particulary in respect of managing special investment activities such as Splits, Spin-offs and mergers, etc. The following details some of the problems faced during my usage.\n\n1. First and foremost problem is the inability to correct any mistakes while entering the transaction. For example if a split is entered then the program automatically adjusts the number of  shares and the cost basis. However there will neither be a record of this action in the Account nor any way to delete or reverse it.\n\n2. Most surprisingly even if the entire transactions of that particular equity is deleted and reentered it will not allow the re-entry of the split on that particular date. The program will return a dialog stating that A SPLIT EXISTS ON THAT DATE. One can perhaps get around it by using a different date for the split but imagine re-entering all transactions including any dividends received etc. It becomes a NIGHTMARE.\n\n3. Money does handle Splits, Spin-offs and Mergers nicely if the data is entered correctly the very first time. But God forbid if a mistake is made. THERE IS NO WAY TO REVIEW, CORRECT OR RE-ENTER the data.\n\nMoney also has very poor report creating functionality. To create a report for any other dates than year ends requires some efforts.\n\nThe Customer Support tries hard to be helpful but they seem to lack either the expertise or the knowledge to redress any problems like mentioned above. They probably have sufficient knowledge and experience to guide customers through basic features but they are completely at sea when it comes to some complicated transactions such as mentioned above.\n\nAt the end is Consumer Be Warned is probably true!!", "label": 2}

Also it includes an application that has gotten no notarity from apple that is called \"Grapher\" this application is almost worth 10.4 to some people because it has such a huge varity of graphs that you can build on it, it has a great user interface and is well using. But Apple has failed in many ways. It has come up short by adding a ton of bugs. Some features are rather user spfic, such as Automator, this lets you set the computer to do things for you, I would almost never use it, it also includes a app called Voice over I still see no wish to use it at all. The minimized windows have a foggy icon when you look at them. Dashboard is very nice but is a copy of konfabulator- a 3rd party application that came up with the idea first. Mind you by the time you read this Apple may have released updates that remove the bugs but I would highly sugest going to macmod.com and viewing this- [...]\n\n-It has reviews by a number of mac owners and goes greatly in depth. I sugest that if apple has not yet released a update by the time you think about buying this, don't waste your money yet.

{"text": "I mainly use this tool to perform searches and generate reports from other sources (ie. Ancestry.com).  The reports (family trees) consistently place children in the wrong chronological order, and spouses out of order (wife 2 before wife1).  The individual's birth dates are shown correctly, but the tool apparently doesn't use the date to sort the information.  The reports are really quite useless as a result.  Sad considering date sorting is one of the most basic of software functions. How that slipped past testing is really beyond me (the dates being compared are a consistent format).  From the blogs I've read they refuse to provide a software update fix, instead you must purchase the next version.  Haven't read if the new version actually fixed the bug.\n\nIt does have some nice features, such of showing missing data or signalling possible errors within an individual's data.  Anyone using Ancestry.com knows there are no good search tools there, so you must use a tool such as RootsMagic to perform searches: for instance if you want to find all people in your tree born in a particular town or who are buried in a particular location.

{"text": "I have to give it 3 stars because they did succeed in putting a lot of cool stuff into one package. But it can be a very aggravating program to work in.\n\nHere are the good things: The photo editing piece is very, very good -- it does an excellent job of fixing exposure and color, and gives you lots of special effects. The disc copier is nice because it will break up files for you, so if it's going to spread over 4 CDs, you can just kick it off and come in every now and then to feed it a new CD. Very nice. It has a lot of video-editing perks, although they can be temperamental. The scene detection is a nice touch and it seems to work fairly well.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe DVD authoring, IMO, is POOR. Gives you very little control, audio is often out of synch with the video, marking chapters is a failed exercise in frustration. If this is why you are buying this product, stop right here! Do not get it, trust me. Maybe the 7.5 version is better but I'm not hopeful -- but at the very least, stay away from 7.0 for this feature. It is aggravating at best.\n\nDespite all of the things I like about this product, I have to say that in the year+ that I've used this product it has given me nothing but grief. This is a perfect example of how important the small details are. This product was, in my opinion, rushed to market with a lot of bugs in it. Some have been fixed and others have been ignored. Just a few examples of little annoyances that sound silly but trust me, after the 100th time you will be aggravated: The program closes unexpectedly and you lose your work. It will sometimes decide to gray out all the menu options so you have to shut down in order to save what you were working on. It doesn't remember any custom settings even though it says it has saved them. It always defaults to their chosen location ie \"My Pictures\" and gives you no quick shortcut to get to where you want or option to change the default -- so it's about a 5-click process each time to get to the folder you want. Opening a production in VideoWave gives you a smaller window with the most recent files, you then have to browse to find the file you want and it adds it to the list (why not just open it directly??) then you have to click it AGAIN from the list, then hit \"ok\". It doesn't save your default save picture quality, so again it is a 4-click process each and every time you save a photo if you want it saved at the highest quality... defaults to 7/10 I don't know why.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you want a cost-effective way to get a lot of different features you might be happy with this. But if you are an intermediate to advanced user who wants a very robuts DVD authoring program, you're better off buying a piece of software that focuses on that.", "label": 2}

I decided to go ahead and try this software, despite the scathing reviews.\n\nAfter using previous versions of almost every Symantec problem with few problems (going literally back to DOS), this one exploded in my face.  After uninstalling System Works Premier 2003 and installing this, Add/Remove Programs would still open, however I could no longer see anything listed.  I received countless errors after Windows (2000) booted and launching any portion of the program suite resulted in errors / crashes.\n\nSince I was trying to install this on a dedicated ghost system (that had absolutely nothing besides Windows 2000 & System Works 2003 fully updated) installed on it, I went ahead and formatted the drive again with Windows 2000 and installed System Works 2005.  I've had no problems whatsoever at this point.  The Windows version of Ghost runs slow, but everything worked exactly as advertised.\n\nI'm a little conflicted on how to rate this software.

I am well aware of this since I am smart enough to run a logged firewall.  IE was the worst culprit, but since it is practically part of XP, XP users have to live with it.\nAnd it would seem as though CD's burned with XP's integrated CD burning software sometimes do not work in any other OS besides windows.\nI also noticed massive compatibility problems with older applications that were written for Windows 95 or 98.\nAnd if you think XP SP1 makes it any better, you're wrong.  Contrary to what MS promised in court, the SP only hides MS's middleware and leaves IE integrated even if you swap it out.\nAnd Windows XP hides almost all of the inner workings of the OS and computer from the user so that most people have no idea how to fix it if something goes seriously wrong.  This applies more to sys admins than desktop users, but it is still relivant; the easier to use an OS is, the more likely a company is to hire unskilled people to administer it, and if something goes horribly wrong they wind up paying a specialist to fix it.\nIs the higher total cost and frustration really worth it?

If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.\n\nWithout a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.\n\nThe third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.\n\nThere is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.\n\nBut I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the \"vos\" (as opposed to \"vosotros\") is used instead of the \"tu\" form.\nOne of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.\n\nSome other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.\n\nTo speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.\n\nThe last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>. This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable. To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series", "label": 1}

WAY more interesting than just having a book or a cassette.  I would hardly call it \"immersion,\" however, unless they sent several Spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program!

I like some of the features offered in this package, such as the ability to track an attack using traceroute. However, I find it difficult to get to some of these features and the pop up blocker is overly restrictive. I have to manually add web sites that I want to allow pop ups (including opening a new browser window). I have to search hard for the option to exclude pop up web sites from the filter list as it is burried deep in the options. Other times I've had to disable the privacy software to get work done on a few web sites for similar reasons as well. I find it odd that I have to enter two passwords to enable the privacy features once they have been disabled. These are nitpicks though. The software works and give me really good control over what I allow onto my machine, if not too much control. My preference and recommendation to friends is to choose Norton. I find it much easier to work with. Mcafee did not pass my user friendly test for people who are not computer experts. This is why I give 3 stars for the software.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I love the Carmen games, but this one got boring after I'd beaten it once because it's got only one storyline. Trying to click on people and items was tedious and it made me long for the classic text-based version. I would have given it two stars, but it gets three because of Lynne Thigpen, Carmen Sandiego's between-cases cameos, the awesome state-a-base and the seven ACME Good Guides. Kids and adults will learn a lot from this game...more info here than in any previous Carmen USA games.\n\nIf you're having trouble filling out a warrant, like the previous reviewer was, request that a Good Guide to show around any state. After he/she gives you the tour or a portion of it, he or she will be able to help you fill out the warrant via the videophone, with one catch. If you request a tour of Florida, Ivan Idea(the ACME Florida Good Guide) won't be able to help you verify your warrant until you leave Florida. The game's manual doesn't mention this.\n\nWhen it comes to catching Carmen, look at the faxed message that you'll have collected over solving the cases. All the clues are there as to what Carmen's disguise is if you read through it carefully...although I failed to nab her on my first attempt. The previous reviewer's description was quite accurate, missing only a few minor details. You'll get a shot to catch her right after you're a Super Sleuth. If you misidentify her, she busts three of her VILE henchmen from jail and you'll have to wait two or three more cases to arrest her.\n\nNot only do clues get harder as each level increases, the tourists around the crook look more and more similar as the game progress.

{"text": "I was wanting to learn Japanese, not only to read and speak fluently, buy to be able to talk to myself without anyone knowing what i was saying. With this program, I am able to achieve my wish! This software is so down to earth and friendly, I am surprised I am not talking to an actual person.\n\nI have had this software for a few months now, and when I get a break from my classes, I enjoy the time I spend learning this new language. There is one or two words placed wrongly in a sentence in English, but that is throughout the entire program, while its nothing to ponder on what they just said. You can also report it to Brak, and I am sure they will fix it.\n\nHow it works: At the beginning, there is a very mild and friendly introduction, that warms you up to what is coming later. Then, it gives you a tad but of history and few moments to tell you about the writing sysytem. Once that is over, it brings you through Hirigana, the first part, all the while showing you how to write the character and giving you a hint on how to write and how to remember it. Hirigana part 1 is over, now a few pages on the Geography of Japan. Now to Hirigana part 2! Once you have learned Hirigana, they launch you into an amazingly simple and easy introduction to Greetings and what to call things around the home, and explaining how verbs are used. There are 40 chapters, and I am only on 20, which is great, because I am at my own limit, as well as you can, either if you are slow or busy, or fast or in a rush. You need time for this though.\n\nThis software is cheap, as in the price, compared to Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone just starts flinging out words at you, where you have to figure out how to say it, and what it means, with no training under your belt. Not Human Japanese. I was about to buy a few books on how to speak and read Japanese, but i decided to go on a whim and purchase this software. I do not regret it, and it might have been the best 30 dollars i have ever spent......but i don't keep track. I am definitely going to buy Human Japanese Intermediate once I am done with this one. I am even hoping for them to do a Russian learning software.\n\nBuy this if you are wanting a friendly, self paced software that you can have fun working through, but if you wished to be pushed through learning a language, and like to guess what your saying, go somewhere else. If this was 50 or 100 dollars, i would still buy it, and still say it is the best learning program i have ever used.\n\nRemember as well, that this has fun match games and contest you can do with yourself or the computer, and beautiful recorded sound for the voices.", "label": 1}

I also wanted to include the support poles in the design that appear every 19 feet throughout the space. There was no graphic for this in the included library.

In Jump Start, each task contributes towards making scooters that can win a race.  Simple enough, but the logistics of the overall game are complex and are never explained.

Every single thing has to be manually converted to feet and inches, which in my personal case was loads of work while I tried to convert our architect's drawings into a 3-D model. The other really poor thing is the 3-D engine. Once you design the house and view it in 3-D there is no smooth way of moving around the house - your change view frame by frame and it is painfully slow. I can't think why they did not just buy a 3-D engine from a gaming product. I had far higher expectations of the 3-D capability. The materials that are available reflect US styles. I struggled to find the sort of materials/colours we use in Denmark - so the roof and the colour of the house didn't really reflect how I expect the house to look - again disappointing. It is easy to develop a basic house, and I managed to develop something that vaguely appropriximated our plans within 3 hours, but the minute you want to do something slightly 'different' - for example create a room that has one part of the floor lower than the other, add a glass wall (from floor to roof), or if you want to use the space between the ceiling and the roof as a living space - well it is not very intuitive and the help (there is no user guide or tutorial other than a very basic wizard) is very limited.

{"text": "I bought this product for my 12-year old son to entice him into meditation. I am sure the game will be doing a good job at that even though he hasn't started yet. There is gameplay, beautiful graphic and good biofeedback.\n\nHowever, as a meditation teacher I would like to raise one thing: Biofeedback is good for getting into meditation but for 'real meditation' it is more a hindrance than a help.\n\nWhy is this so? All 'real' meditation aims at a state of oneness - ultimately at oneness with the divine. Biofeedback by its very nature prevents this state of oneness because it always keeps the part of our mind awake that judges ourselves and asks questions like, 'do I do this correctly?', 'can I do this better?' While these questions are valuable when starting out with meditation they need to be abandoned later on as the meditator and the object of meditation (mantra, visualisation, breath etc.) merge.\n\nThe journey to the wild divine is a valuable tool to learn to relax and invogorate your mind/body and learn certain breathing techniques in order to accomplish that. For that reason it can be compared to the warming-up exercises of an athlete or of the finger exercise of a pianist. I do not want to down-play how important mind-control is.\n\nIt can not teach you, however, the meat and flesh of meditation - the abandonement into something that is utterly uncontrollable, mysterious and the fulfillment of our deepest dreams. No biofeeedback device can give us information about how loving and wise we are. These states will only develop in us when love, devotion and surrender become the main focus of meditation - just like a pianist can never produce beautiful music from perfect finger technique alone. Biofeedback - by its nature - is essentially self-centred and thus - when used as the sole means of development - prevents the emergence of any true form of spirituality.\n\nWhy only three stars? Because the set came without a user manual. I think for this price tag the manufacturers should have included a beautiful little booklet to explain to the novices of meditation and biofeedback what this is all about. Also, not all the exercises are self-explanatory.\n\nUpdate: Now my son, my husband (who is also an experienced meditator) and I have spent many hours playing. My son - to my joy - loves this game. Many of the exercises are relatively easy for him - or at least after a little guidance from us - BUT THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT PROVIDED BY THIS GAME. I find it hard to imagine how a complete novice should find this out just by trial and error.\n\nThe relaxation exercises, however, are extremely hard. I have decades of meditation experience and work as a relaxation teacher. I know I am not bad at relaxing because I can put myself consciously too sleep. I can also start dreaming while I am totally conscious. However, in order 'to open the doors' in this game I need to focus for 30 to 40 minutes, sitting absolutely motionless with breath suspended to be hardly detectable. One single deeper breath, one single joyful thought that 'I am nearly there' and immediately the door closes. My husband doesn't do any better.\n\nMy son cracked this problem by lying on the sofa, finger sensors on his hand and really tries going to sleep and not looking at the biofeedback. It still takes him 15min that way.\n\nSo, I am just writing this as a little warning about how difficult this game is. I think a couple of other revieweres who are very experienced in meditation as well attested to the same difficulties.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is the first edition of PaperPort that I have used, so I am not writing this from the perspective of the value of an upgrade from earlier versions.  This is a \"first impressions\" review.\n\nRight after I installed it, I wanted to start an index on my computer.  I have about 30 Gig of documents, so I knew this would be a chore.\n\nFirst effort:  Run the included \"Index Manager\".  This failed because Index manager does not erase temp files until the entire scan completes.  I had 40 Gig of free space on my disk, but that wasn't enough.  I had to abort the scan.  A full two days wasted before I recognized the issues with Index Manager.\n\nSecond effort:  Run the internal index by selecting, \"Add to all-in-one index\".  This seemed to work, however it kept me from using PaperPort while running.  I decided to try another route.\n\nThird effort:  Setup to scan during \"idle time\" and let it run.  This worked fine.  It still took hours, however it cleaned up as it went.  I was still unable to use PaperPort while the index ran because the index would restart.  I did let it complete my index, however.\n\nNow I have all my documents indexed.  How does maintenance work?  Many of the local PC search utilities tie into Windows XP functionality and update in realtime without having to rescan the hard disk.  Not true with PaperPort.  Clearly dependent on old code, it must scan periodically.  Okay, we'll move on.\n\nPaperPort will scan during idle times.  The problem is that it reads through everything, every time.  Then if you use PaperPort, let it go idle, it will again restart from the beginning.  If you have a substantial amount of documents, this method just won't do.  The index program will run constantly.\n\nSince I have the professional version, I have \"Index Manager\", which allows me to schedule regular updates for my index.  While this tool was unacceptable for building the initial index, it does work for maintenance.  I set it up and let it run through and \"update\" my documents.  Just to be clear, no changes were made to my documents, I just wanted to test the program.  Even though every single document was recently indexed and not one file was changed, it still took hours to rescan my data.  Monitoring the temp folder, it produced over 1 Gig of temp files for documents that were not modified.  This is horribly inefficient.  Even with no document changes, an update scan will take a half day to complete.  This is INSANE!\n\nA \"professional\" edition of this product should index documents better.  The entire index process is totally garbage-by-design.  My point deductions for this program are strictly due to the indexing process.\n\nIf your documents are less than a couple gig, then this application will probably work okay for you.\n\nSo now onto the application of PaperPort.  What a great product!  I could make a long list of things to improve, but the improvements I would suggest are minor.  I love being able to see the pages of my documents, to search through all these PDF documents, OmniPage projects (I love OmniPage), etc.\n\nFor the main application, you can use PaperPort to manage documents in all new ways.  I love being able to stack and unstack pages, move things around, and it makes short work of organizing my huge collection of electronic documents.  I could list a dozen features I would like to see added, however what is provided works extremely well.\n\nI have to add a couple more negatives.  If you want support, you have to pay for it.  You get one free call and that's it.  The documentation is weak, the knowledgebase is rediculously weak, and email is billable.  The forums are the only free option for support and I have not been able to get a login setup for the forums.\n\nI am a huge fan of OmniPage Pro 14 and I use it all the time.  PaperPort will be part of my new routine for the time being.  If I find a better product, I will fly quickly away since PaperPort cannot maintain indexes very well.\n\nIndexing:  1 Star\n\nDocument Acquiring:  5 Stars\n\nApplication Functionality:  3.5 Stars\n\nSupport: 2 Stars\n\nConclusion:  If you are interested in electronic document management and your volume is reasonably modest, this product is an excellent value.  If you want a \"professional\" tool, don't be fooled by the word \"professional\" in the title of this product.  This is not a professional solution.", "label": 2}

I worked with this software for two days and decided to buy Power Writer instead.\n\nYou can build a story using this software by generating character templates and then answering questions about the themes and relationships within the story.  You can jot notes all along the way, but I found I was writing the same thing down over and over again.  Eventually that pays off when your getting towards the end and the notes are already there, but it is long, tedious, and not fun.  You start with almost 33,000 possible storylines that narrow down to one and then you can map out your Chapters and export everything to a word processor to print out.  You can use the print out as your personal guide and then start writing your story.  Characters can be complex or straight archetype templates.  I think when you get focused on the templates it narrows the possibilities for dynamic and interesting people.  A hero isn't always hero-like, but it is good to know the basic archetypes.  I also found the templates greatly reduce the possibilities for the story's theme and progression.  I did not want my hero to only be logical and then only be able to be categorized as a do-er...these things kind of killed my storyline altogether, but I am sure it created a storyline that I could have worked with instead.\n\nThe demo does not let you print, export or save so I do not know if the reports were any good or not.  I do not know if they were clear cut or just a lot of additional information I may or may not need.\n\nI found the process a lot of boring busy work and not much fun.  It has a nice interface and is easy enough to use, but it doesn't allow for a lot of creativity or research notes.

GRAMPS can import and export GEDCOMs and can create a multitude of customized reports about your family tree.\n\nI use Pidgin to keep in touch with friends on AIM, and Firefox lets me use MySpace and Facebook, etc.  I also upload and watch videos on YouTube, read RSS feeds, and create photo books on Shutterfly using the Firefox browser.\n\nI can open, read, and write .doc, .xls, and .ppt files from MS-Office using OpenOffice and share them with colleagues.  I can read and create pdf files, too.\n\nAll of the software I've mentioned above either comes free on the Ubuntu disk or you can download and add it for free using Synaptic, the software installer.\n\nProbably the best thing about using Linux is the complete absence of nag-ware.  Your computer programs won't constantly nag you to \"set this application as the default for X type of file\" or to upgrade to the version that actually works.  Linux, and the applications on it, were created by people who use the programs.  They don't like intrusive ads, pop-ups, and nag-ware anymore than you do.  You can't buy software like this.\n\nThe system for adding and removing software, called Synaptic, is elegant and easy to use.\n\nUbuntu is not without flaws.  If you know what hardware you want to use, Google around and find out if it will work with Ubuntu-- sometimes there aren't drivers for certain kinds of hardware.  What that means is that your wifi card or your printer may not play nicely with Ubuntu.  Check first!\n\nI have yet to find a Linux video editor for use by non-experts.  The video editing software I have found generally demands a higher level of familiarity with the technical specifications of digital video than I have come close to achieving.  I have to use a different operating system to make video DVDs of home movies & slides.  That's not to say it's impossible with Linux; it's just impossible for me with Linux.\n\nThere is a large and active Ubuntu web forum where I have been happy to find answers to my questions and very little of the geek arrogance that used to be so prevalent on the USENET linux newsgroups.\n\nUbuntu Linux is a great product, with free upgrades and updates, and an enthusiastic user community that will help you make the most of it.  It is as easy to learn as any new operating system-- if you made the jump from Windows 95 to Windows XP, or you taught yourself how to use XP, then you can use Ubuntu.  But remember, Ubuntu is not, and is not trying to be, a Windows operating system.  If you can live with that, and you're willing to learn how it works, you should be very happy.", "label": 1}

The other members of your party no longer have occupations or much personality.  The screen no longer scrolls as you hunt.  There are less choices to make and overall the game is more likely to bore the adult who tries to play it with children. The only thing not simpler is the the purchasing that still confused my 9 year old brother (who is good at math) so badly I had to make his purchases for him to keep him from quitting.\nThe lack of feedback at the end of the game is quite irritating.

{"text": "Okay, I tried to run Morrowind on this system which is plugged up around the school, and it wouldn't work. Because Morrowind is such a high-end game as far as PC requirements I figured as much, until I noticed they said I needed a Pentium 3 and I had a Pentium 4. Anyway, Morrowind wouldn't run properly, even though it was advertised to work up to Windows XP.  It at least worked, but it was extremely slow and had a problem since it was mouse based. In short, every time I used a menu, it took 15-20 minutes to select something as the mouse jammed and then skipped. The same was true for my DVD, and the DVD itself would jam in the middle of playing, whereas at home on my Windows 98 computer, all games and programs ran smoothly. This is only the first problem.\n2)Bad graphical processing\nLike I said, the DVDs often don't even work, or they lag in playback.  Also, games don't even work that well\n3)Poor DOS handling\nI tried to install this game called Daggerfall on my dorm computer, and the installation used DOS.  The computer was Windows 2000 with XP \"enhancements.\"  It blacked out and froze before it started. I tried XP computers, and they were just as bad.  Then I tried a Windows 98, and within 15 minutes, the huge sized installation was mostly done.\nTrue, there are a few things good about this:\n1-> Faster download (maybe)\n2-> Built-in programs (including one that unzips files)\nHowever, number 2 leads to problem 4.\n4) Limited programs\nThat unzip program may only do one unzip at a time, whereas winzip can at least try to do more. This program on the other hand, opens a separate window, insuring the futility of this endeavor.\n3-> Faster 2-D/ small-scale graphic programming\nIf you want to play emulated games, sure go ahead, it will have no problems with it, but this too is a problem, as it speeds through stuff much faster than its normal rate was supposed to be. Anything computer rendered however, will likely lag on you.\nIn conclusion, Windows XP is more of a virus than an OS, so one would be wise to avoid it.", "label": 0}

I thought it was okay but I was looking for more conversational Spanish and I found Rosetta Stone to be lacking in the area of conversational Spanish, providing vocabulary words to review, and the content in level 1 was slightly too sophomoric for my opinion.  As a result I did research on the web read reviews and discovered that \"tell me more\" was the best rated on Amazon and other review websites.  I was very disappointed in the product, I found the software was not user friendly and I'm very computer literate. I was not interested in doing crossword puzzles and grammar exercises yet I could not complete the guided course work without it. when I went to free roam mode I found that there was not enough opportunity for the program to allow me to listen and repeat dialogue it was amazingly cumbersome just to make progress in anything compared to Rosetta stone. Additionally I'm not that interested in learning grammatical structure I want to hear people speaking, read the words and learn via  picture, association and repetition.  Also it did not have the dynamic learning mode this was also disappointing. I also discovered that the software was last produced in 2004, outdated. In  speech recognition mode it kept going and going and I get no feedback as to whether I was finished, it kept going no matter how many times I tried; it said my pronunciation was moderate while other speech recognition software showed my pronunciation to be good after practicing.  In summary I hated my experience and return the product immediately.  I wish Rosetta Stone had more conversational Spanish and reviewed topics of conversation that were slightly more adult oriented for level 1, I'm hoping level two is better as I'm going to purchase Rosetta Stone immediately.  Please note everyone learns differently and has different expectations I was just surprisingly shocked at how difficult it was to make progress and really jump right in learning listening and repeating, it's just not for me maybe it could be something you like?", "label": 0}

It gives you a solid foundation in the basics of Japanese writing, grammar, sentence structure, culture, and gets you over many of the hurdles that beginning Japanese learners face.\n\nThis product is an amazing deal, in my opinion. For such a low price, you learn so much, you enjoy learning it, and you actually remember what they teach. This software is like a favorite, enjoyable book that you just can't put down.\n\nSome of my favorite features of this program:\n- Awesome cultural tidbits and information about Japan and geography!\n- Useful vocabulary and phrases and a way to look up any Japanese word that the program uses!\n- A warm, inviting approach that makes it HUMAN and not like a textbook.\n- The tech support is amazing. The creators are really nice, always trying to improve their software and bring it to new places and levels. They respond immediately.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n- If you don't know hiragana and katakana, you'll learn how to write it, stroke order, stroke number, and little tips to remember how to write the kana well. If you're like me and already know it, it can give you a nice refresher course!\n- Culture, history, geography, and more presented in a way that keeps you interested.\n- Nice, clear photographs and clear male and female speaking voices.\n- Dialogue that helps you learn to recognize speech patterns, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and learn to read hiragana and katakana at the rate they are speaking, instead of relying on romaji.\n- Easy to navigate chapters and reviews. Reviews that include flash cards and the very helpful vocabulary quizzes.\n- Compliments books and other learning methods well, and is a great, easy to use reference for anything you need a refresher on - like wa and ga, or what that darn word for kitchen is.\n\nThis product is simply excellent. It is a MUST buy. Don't believe me? Try the demo on their website.\nI was skeptical, too, but after trying the demo I was absolutely HOOKED.\nTop 10 Reviews put it at number 5 out of 11, but in my opinion, it belongs much higher on the list!\n\nDomo arigatou gozaimasu, Human Japanese!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Unfortunately this course uses the present progressive tense throughout, where as in real life, the present indicative is usually the tense most commonly used. The present progressive tense indicates that the action is in progress right now, e.g. I am eating (now), He is jumping (now). In Spanish the present progressive tense is quite restricted and is usually limited to what a person is doing RIGHT NOW.  The present progressive is formed by conjuagting the appropriate ending of one verb,the verb estar, and adding the gerund of the appropritate verb. Some examples from the course might be: Los muchachos estn saltando (The boys are jumping (right now); El nio est corriendo, (The boy is running) etc. It's kind of like the old Dick and Jane stuff. The point is, you get a lot of work with the verb \"estar\" and a lot of work with the gerund (the \"ing\" form )of other verbs, but little else. This is a cop out and it is not the way people speak.\n\nThe present indicative is much more versatile tense and is the most commonly used tense in the spanish language (The present progressive, on the other hand, is little used).  The present indicative can be used just like the present progressive, it can be used to express the future (e.g. Voy maana, I'm leaving tomorrow), it can be used to express a polite command (e.g. Me trae un cafe, por favor--bring me a coffee, please. In most instances this simple command form is considered much more polite than using the imperative mood (Me trae...is all you'll ever need in a restaurant). The present indicative tense refers to the specific now (as does the present progressive), but it also refers to the general now (these days, this time period, e.g., I live in the U.S.; I'm going to the store, I'm studying Spanish (This is a good example that shows clearly what I'm talking about--I'm studying Spanish now, yesterday and tomorrow--an ongoing \"studying\" of Spanish--Estudio espaol (present indicative) as opposed to estoy estudiando espaol--I've got the book open in front of me and that's what I'm doing at this very moment.\n\nWith this program you learn the endings to the verb estar, learn the gerund of a couple hundred verbs and bingo, you're talking spanish. It's easy--no learning all those separate endings for all those verbs, no learning irregular verbs, etc.  The problem is, it ain't the way people talk.  This is such an egregious error, it's so impractical, that I'm surprised they continue to sell the program without correcting the problem.

The preschool has less \"story\" to it; it has more games, songs, & a zillion printable activities (we haven't done them since the kids computer isn't hooked up to a printer-- another thing they might break).

If its difficult to navigate for me, the kids definitely will not be able to navigate freely. It will not allow you to skip something. If the kids are using the same thing again and again and They want to skip the things they are bored of they are out of luck. It will not allow skip. Apart from that the program is educational. Another negative: The program does not install on computer. Every time you need to put the CD in to run the program.\n\nInstead of struggling with Reader Rabbit, I would highly recommend the Leapfrog Letter Factory and Math Circus. In fact I bought all Leapfrog DVD titles one by one after seeing the difference the Frog makes to kid's learning.

{"text": "I purchased this item six weeks ago in hopes of refreshing my basic understanding of spanish, which I hadnt used in any form in years. While I won't go so far as to say this item is a complete failure, I will say that it is definitely lacking. The simplest analogy I can think of is this software goes from step one to step three, and leaves you wondering what was supposed to be in the middle. I have tested each cd, some as high as a dozen times, and feel no strong connection to the software. I find that the nouns, verbs, and sayings that I had previously learned are sticking, but most of whats new is failing to make an impression. I even write each word on an index card, along with the phonetic spelling, and then review the word later to make more of a connection. Without taking those extra few steps, I feel like I would have learned 10% as much as I have, which hasn't been much. The review games are hacky,and most of the visuals are crude cartoon drawings. Furthermore, one male and one female greet you on some of the lesson screens in an attempt to simulate someone talking. In reality, there's a two second loop that plays for each person, and it skips then repeats over and over as long as the lesson is going. It doesnt sound like much, and Im having a hard time accurately describing the presentation, but trust me, its annoying. All in all, the product isn't terrible, but I don't expect to fully absorb more than a few hundred words due solely to this software. If I had had the 749 Rosetta Stone wanted, I probably would have went that route. But hey, for 29.99, adding 500 words to my spanish vocabulary isn't that bad after all.", "label": 2}

I was finally able to make contact (through email) and was able to resolve the problems. It still loads slower than Version 15; it still takes almost 20 seconds after the program opens before I can use it because of the Project Picker's slow loading. But it is a good program. I don't rate it any higher than 3 because to me it's not enough better than Version 15 in the areas that are important to me to rate the price they're asking. I recommend trying it out first if you can before buying. See if the features appeal to you enough to justify buying it. Personally, though I love the Print Shop products, I think this should have been offered as an upgrade to those of us who have the program already. If I had checked it out first I don't think I would have paid the price for what is offered. I would have made do with Version 15 until a better product is offered. But that's just me.

{"text": "For the basic functions of keeping a checkbook type of register, watching stocks, and setting/monitoring a budget, this product has worked fine for me.  It has, however, some glitches.\nThe one glitch that is currently plaguing me is the \"Cash Flow\" projection graph.  This function takes a look at what you have in your scheduled payments/deposits and displays a projected daily balance over a set period (user defined) using a shaded line graph.  A nice idea if you diligently have all of your anticipated bills and deposits set up in the program, which I did.  Using the Cash Flow review, you could figure out whether you could afford that stereo next month or the following month.\nThe problem is, apparently, sometimes the bills/deposits file gets corrupted and then the graph will not display at all.  I visited the MS site, found the precise problem in the knowledge database, and went through all of the methods MS provided.  It was to no avail, and my Cash Flow function is now non-functional.  Even a re-install didn't work.

{"text": "The real-time speech recognition of IBM ViaVoice 10 is extremely good.  It is possible to get 99% accuracy.  Possible is the key word here.  In order to do that, you need a good microphone (better than what is included) and you will have to teach it words that it doesn't know (i.e. Plantronics, uncommon names).  And you'll need to be in a supported product like Microsoft Word.  If all these conditions are met, you're in like Flint.\nI, unfortunately, was trying to use Internet Explorer, and the support was less than stellar.  The voice command \"surf the web\" did launch it and the \"home\", \"back\", and \"forward\" commands worked well to do the obvious.  But the undocumented commands became key to navigation.  To tab from one field or link to the next, you say \"next field\".  \"Previous field\" is like a shift-tab to go backwards.  \"next line\" and \"previous line\" seem to be equivalent to the down and up arrows.\nThe microphone included with this package is the Andrea NC-61 along with the Andrea USB pod, which is a half of a sound card (microphone side only) that connects through your USB port.  I found the quality of the pod to be excellent.  Andrea advertises the NC-61 headset as using noise cancelling technology, but I found this microphone to not even be directional, and pretty much useless in any environment in which anyone else was speaking, however softly, in the same room.  I did purchase separately an Andrea ANC-750 microphone and the noise cancelling on that microphone was quite good. (note: there is some white noise in the background that is audible if you use the ANC-750 to make a recording, but this should be ignored, as it is part of the noise cancelling system.)\nThe best performance was when I used a high quality studio microphone in a quiet environment to create my voice profile by reading their text.  The recognition accuracy was amazing.  I used an AKG C-3000 (needs phantom power), but I've heard that a Sennheiser MD431 II is another excellent microphone, and has noise canceling properties as well.  The best performance I got from my ANC-750 headset was when I used the voice profile created with the C-3000.\nI give the voice recognition part of the software a 5, the navigational ability a 2, and the included microphone a 2, hence my rating of 3 overall.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I just wanted to provide a balance to some of the other reviews below.  I currently have two machines running ME.\nThe first was an upgrade from Win-95 two years ago, and I've had little problems with it during that time.  The installation was easy.  Once I learned to stay away from the Active Desktop, and got a reference on setting up some of the maintenance tasks, using it has been easy (scheduling disk maintenance and such).  Since then I've added additional RAM, a CD-R/W, two different printers and several large software packages (such as Front Page and JBuilder) without problems.  I might also note that the upgrade solved several problems I was having with slow modem connections.  Since upgrading to ME I've never had a problem with currupted anything on this machine.\nLast weekend I purchased and installed the full version on a second machine.  For the last year I had been struggling with various versions of Linux on it, and after getting REALLY frustrated trying to establish a network connection between the two machines I got mad, ran over to BestBuy and purchased ME.  Within 4 hours of buying it I was file sharing with the other machine.\nNow, I'm a programmer by trade, so I don't say it lightly that I was having trouble making Linux work for me as a home OS.  I decided that I was spending far to much time trying to get Linux to work rather than using it to develope software, word processing, installing or upgrading packages and other tasks.  I get paid for that at work.  Windows ME might have its warts, and I wish it would support FrontPage's server features, but for $... you can get a couple of good references for getting around some of the more annoying ones.\nIf you are using an earlier version of Windows, it is well worth the $... to upgrade.  I  decided NOT to upgrade to or use XP because of some of the many issues surrounding privacy and configuration some people have, which is why this last weekend I purchased the full version of ME instead of XP.\nIt also helps to make sure you include all the patch updates from the MS web site, again a task made easy to do and automate in ME compared to earlier versions of Windows and just plain confusing in Red Hat Linux (I never knew if what I was 'patching' was anything I really needed or not, where as with ME the package updates are clear to read and understand).", "label": 2}
{"text": "My first experience with Human Japanese was the very first version released. It was a simple program that, while not very attractive to look at, presented Japanese in a simple way that anyone could really understand. When I heard that there was a Human Japanese 2.0, I rushed to get the demo and eventually the full version.\n\nWell, first let me talk about Human Japanese in general. As the name implies, the program tries to teach you Japanese in a \"Human\" way. Without fancy terminology or complicated explanations, but rather doing it in a way that a tutor might teach you. Giving you little hints to remember writing, or making silly acronyms to remember concepts, this program tries to do things like that. It certainly is refreshing to see that kind of teaching being used in a computer program.\n\nHuman Japanese 2.0 is broken up into 40 lessons, some focused on grammar while others try to steer the reader towards learning new words and expressions along with writing. At the end of each lesson, there is usually a quiz to test your knowledge of the things learned in that chapter. These can range from small multiple choice quizzes, matching games, and an \"Endless\" type quiz which tests your vocab.\n\nStuck in between every seven or so lessons are chapters devoted entirely to culture. These small 4-7 page bits are a treat to read. They talk about things like Geography, Prices in Japan, and Bathing among other things. Many more of these for Human Japanese 3.0 would certainly be nice.\n\nThe changes from Human Japanese 1 are certainly noticeable at first glance. The interface is changed from the plain white background of 1.0 to a nice background with shades of green and silhouettes of trees. There is now a small search bar on the right side of the screen to look up any vocab term that has appeared in the program. There are also visual aids added to the lessons which, while probably not amazingly helpful, do look nice.\n\nUnfortunately, the changes from Human Japanese 1 are mainly visual. Although there are now 40 lessons, they are mostly just each of the 20 lessons from the previous version split into two lessons. This means that most of the 40 lessons are identical to content in the last version, although they tend to have a bit more meat on them (They are a bit longer, and most have a few extra vocab added).\n\nThe interface change is nice, but when making Human Japanese 3.0, I'd urge them to take the time to make up more lessons to further the readers knowledge.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have a love/hate with Windows XP right now: I love the new look and the new features, but I hate the fact that BOTH computers I have on Windows XP crash repeatedly and often.  This is NOT the stable OS Microsoft talks about in their ads -- at least not yet!\nOn the positive side, as several other reviewers have remarked, the new Plug and Play is beautiful. Support for wireless, pictures, video, and music is dramatically improved. You can work with all of these objects right at the desktop level. The operating system loads faster and feels faster. I think it's more intuitive and more fun to use, too.\nHOWEVER, BE WARNED: I have the very latest version (with all the updates) on TWO computers, and BOTH are crashing on me. One system is a new Dell Latitude CP810 laptop I purchased with Windows XP Professional installed. This crashes, oh, probably 3-4 times per day. The crashes are random, but always seem to take place when I click on something: I'll click on a link in Internet Explorer, or my calendar in Outlook.  BAM!  The computer restarts.  I had a similar Dell Laptop running Windows 2000 (Service Pack 2) and never had ANY crashes with it.  So the stability factor has gone WAY down.\nI've submitted numerous crash and bug reports to Microsoft and the system always says I'll be contacted within a few days by email -- I've not received any response in 10 days despite repeated queries and crashes.  My conclusion from this is that\nMicrosoft is just swamped with crashes on this not-ready-for-prime-time OS.\nThe other computer is an HP Pavillion that formerly ran Windows 2000 and never crashed.  Just last night, it decided to crash while nothing happened at all!  Not good.\nI hope Microsoft will fix it, as Windows XP has a lot of potential.\nBut as of now, I cannot recommend this product. Even though it restarts faster from crashes, that's still not a fair trade for having a stable system.  Stick with Windows 2000 until Microsoft figures out how to REALLY keep this OS from crashing.  It is definitely FAR from crash proof right now as I can attest!", "label": 0}
{"text": "I first played this game a few years ago when I was a fifth grader myself, and I recently revisited it. When I was 10, I had mixed feelings about this game, and I still do.\n\nKID APPEAL:\nThe game is rather engaging - its adventure-filled storyline, while slightly weird, appeals a lot to the age range, and the tomboyish protagonist, Jo Hammet, appeals to both males and females. The subtitle that is occasionally attributed to it - \"Jo Hammet, Kid Detective\" - is slightly deceptive; the player doesn't do too much actual sleuthing. \"Jo Hammet, Kid Bomb Squad\" might be more accurate, but your kid won't mind - it's fun either way. Also, some of the activities in this game are very fun and arcade-like. The activities that are not action-packed tend to be more puzzle-oriented, but rather than being frustrating, they are usually pleasurable and fun - not too challenging, not too easy.\n\nA glaring exception to this is the Crossword Puzzle game. It asks some good geography questions, but it also asks questions about art history that are VERY obscure and that no fifth grader should be expected to know. The player can look through an entire museum to find the answers, but unfortunately, it's still quite hard - especially since there's SO much to look through. (One of the artists that you had to answer a question about only painted ONE tiny painting in the entire museum, and it was hidden in an obscure corner!) The crossword puzzle could've been interesting, educational and fun for kids, but sadly, it didn't exactly \"come together\". I agree with the reviewer who suggest Google!\n\nGENERAL EASE OF USE:\nThis product is relatively easy to use and straightforward, but not as much as other kids' educational games (i.e., it doesn't walk you through every step like other games), but this isn't necessarily all bad. There are a few points that are challenging, however. For example, over and over again in this game, you have to go through a \"dialog\" portion where you select things for Jo to say to various characters. Unfortunately, it's really unintuitive; in order to move on from the dialog portion and progress in the game, you need to say a certain \"trigger\" phrase. The option that's the \"trigger\" seems pretty random, at least in the first couple dialog sessions, but as you move on, it starts making at least a little bit more sense.\n\nAlso, one game (which basically consists of solving math problems) is just a tad confusing at first, due to the fact that, rather than typing in the final answer, you have to do it step-by-step - for example, if you're answering 48 + 18, you'd first up the numerals in the ones column, and thus type in 6, and then the program automatically enters the 1 by itself and carries it to the tens column. At first, it's confusing, but once you get used to it, it's actually rather nice and makes it easier. Unfortunately, if you happen to learn how to solve math problems with a different method, it kinda gets difficult and you might need a little help. (This happened with me for multiplication.)\n\nOverall, though, the game is pretty easy to use - there are just a few issues here and there that can be bothersome.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE:\nFirst, I'd like to say that the math in this game is really solid and age-appropriate. You have one game (described in the previous section) that's basically just answering math problems - a little tedious for some kids, but definitely very educational, and personally, I found it enjoyable and challenging. Another game has you using fractional measurements to mix up juice drinks, which is fun, challenging and definitely educational. The last game that involves math has you guiding a tiny android around the inside of a bomb, turning on and off different swtiches that each represent a decimal amount in order to end up at a certain number. All of the math in this game is age appropriate, solid, challenging but not too hard - just overall great, and incorporated well into the games too.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from the math, I find the educational content in this game pretty weak. They try to incorporate a lot of subjects - art, geography, history, parts of speech - but the implementation is kind of messed up. For example, in the section that's supposed to teach history, you have to go through arcade-like levels to find certain objects. Unfortunately, while a window that describes each object pops up when you select it, you don't have to read it or anything - you just need to find the objects, press a checkmark, and you're good to go. No real learning is required.\n\nThere are a lot of not-explicitly-educational, puzzle-type games. They won't please parents who want their kids to learn actual school subjects, but I think they're pretty good for building some general thinking skills, which is definitely a good thing. Still, maybe it'd be better if they put in some...I don't know...READING or WRITING perhaps? All they have in the language arts arena is a weak parts-of-speech game that doesn't really teach much at all; all you have to do is figure out what words would best go in the context, and it's really obvious what words belong.\n\nAlso, if you want your kid to pay attention to one particular subject, you don't really have an option to do that, from what I can see - you have to play specific games as you progress through the game; you can't really select a particular subject. Maybe I'm wrong and there is a way, but I haven't found it.\n\nOTHER:\nI'd also like to mention that this game is very repetitive. There are only about 8 games, and you have to play most of them 6 times each. It's not exactly bursting with variety, but your kid might be willing to persevere to make it through the storyline.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'd say this game is pretty fun, and your kid will probably enjoy it. How much they will enjoy it depends. If your kid is the type to persevere through a good story despite a few long or challenging points, and they like this type of plotline, they'll probably find it really fun. If they get frustrated easily, however, they'll probably give up pretty fast.\n\nAs for the educational value, the math is really strong and fun, but the other subjects kind of failed due to implementation, and the language arts is especially weak. So if you want a game to help your kid practice math and general puzzle-solving (and using Google!), this will probably be a good game education-wise. But if you want to improve reading or writing, this will be pretty useless for them.\n\nLike I said, my feelings are thoroughly mixed. If you can find it for cheap and your kid likes these kinds of games, you should probably go for it. But if you're looking for an exceptional product, sorry - this isn't it. Another game that is a bit better in the educational value and fun departments is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ClueFinders-5th-Grade-Adventures-Secret-of-the-Living-Volcano/dp/B0000691KF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures: Secret of the Living Volcano</a>.

{"text": "This software comes with many different applications.  Some work well, some don't. There are so many features, I haven't been able to test everything.  Here are some problems:\n\n1.  Like most software, the CD has some bugs.  As soon as you install the program from the CD, it is likely you will want to do the upgrades.  But the upgrades take for ever to download.  Instead of just downloading the fixes, the upgrade reloads the complete software.\n\n2.  The CD label software is junk and filled full of bugs.\n\n3.  The software can crash if being used too long, without rebooting the computer.  I think it uses up all the temp memory.\n\n4. While the sound editor was improved, many features and much of the flexibility has been removed.  For instance, you can no longer adjust volumes, or customize fades.\n\n5.  On audio discs, if you want to do transitions, you still have to burn the disc at once and finalize it.  You cannot add tracks later.\n\n6.  The DVD software is not as flexible as other products.\n\n7.  Everytime you copy a DVD, you will be asked what burn speed you want to use, even if you are making multiple copies.  So, you have to stay at your computer and monitor it, if you are burning multiple DVD's.  (You just can't come back when the burning is done and put in another blank).\n\n8.  On the sound editor, you can only work on one track at a time.  When you open a new file, it closes whatever file you are working on.\n\n9.  Merging tracks doesn't really work.  You can merge them in the editor, but you can't save it as a new file, so it is basically worthless.\n\nThe good:\n\n1.  DVD and CD copying is very quick and easy.\n\n2.  Sound editor has improved, so that it generally works better.  It is easier to cut, copy and paste.\n\n3.  In creating an audio CD, the transitions are much better.  You no longer have to put up with a 2 second gap between tracks.  The crossfade works well.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Macintosh OS X is clearly designed for creative/design applications.\nInstead of placing icons on the desktop where they inevitably get covered up by various program windows, the icons are placed in a translucent \"Dock\" that is always visible and available.  It is a great and uncluttered way to manage several applications at once.  For example, people who are designing a web site and need an HTML editor, picture editor, etc. all open at once should find the dock to be a great help.  It is similar to the way Microsoft Windows keeps minimized windows at the bottom of the screen, but Apple's way is much more organized.\nIn addition, you no longer have to dedicate chunks of ram to specific applications.  OS X automatically spreads ram where needed.  You'll probably never see an \"Error Type 2\" message again!\nThe Finder works more like an internet browser, now.  When you open a folder, the contents are revealed on a new page of the same window.  This beats the old Finder that would leave a messy trail of windows behind every search.\nMac OS X is quite stable, too.  Keep in mind, however, that just because the OS is said to be \"Crash-Proof\", that doesn't mean applications can't crash--Indeed they do.  The advantage OS X gives you is that now you don't have to reboot the entire system when only one application has gone bad.  Just force quit the bad app and everything else still works.\nOn the downside, this newer os doesn't feel as \"slick\" as the older OS9 did.  Scroll bars lag behind the mouse, and windows resize in a choppy manner.  And can somebody please tell me why I have to wait over 10 seconds between the time I choose to connect to the internet and the time the computer decides to start dialing?\nSome of the included applications are buggy, too.  Although the OS is stable, I've had to force quit applications that went astray more often than I'd like.  The included Microsoft Internet Explorer is terrible--Redraw errors all over the place, and the first URL is never found (I believe this is because the program is directly translated from the Mac OS9 version where the computer held off all operations until the dial-up connection was completed).\nApple is on to something great with OS X.  I would, however, like to see it run a little slicker.  I trust that bugs will be worked out of  third party applications as the designers become more aware of OS X's inner workings.", "label": 2}

Now, those same computer magazines are saying that Windows XP is full of problems and bugs. Well gee, thanks for telling me that *after* I upgraded!\nWindows XP is far more stable than its predecessors. I can count on one hand the number of times my entire system has crashed with XP; when I ran ME, my entire system would go down at least once a day.\nBut, if you wish to upgrade, keep this in mind:\n* Many people will say you need 256MB of memory. I have absolutely no complaints with XP's speed at 128MB. Don't run out and buy more memory without trying it at 128MB first.\n* The new interface is not worth [upgrading for]. Only upgrade if you want the increased stability.\n* Be prepared for some major hardware failures when you upgrade. My modem did not work when I upgraded, and my video had some problems. If you can, download updated drivers *before* you upgrade. It can also be handy to have a friend's computer at the ready when you upgrade, in case you need to download new drivers.\n* Be prepared for some software failures as well. All my software works with XP, except for Outlook 97, which has mysteriously stopped working.\n* While this OS is more stable than its predecessors, I still discover some strange bugs from time to time. They are an annoyance, but still the OS is better than Windows ME. Even so, you might be [upset] to [purchase]  a new OS and discover that it still has bugs.\nOverall, my upgrade has been worthwhile, but only after a month's worth of hassles to get it working correctly.

{"text": "I will say up front that I have not used this entire CD. I have only done the first lesson from the program, which I downloaded for free from the RosettaStone.com web site.\n\nThe learning style presented in the Rosetta Stone series really is as good as they say it is.  I like the direct presentation of the Chinese and the concept, without English text explaining the grammar, usage, and so on.  I also like the amount of repetition that is built into the exercises.  Somehow that approach seems to place the language deeper into your brain, if that makes sense.  The \"game\" like style is also fun.\n\nWhile I was working with it, my one year old son was learning English, and it was quite clear to me that the Rosetta Stone style really is just like a child's first language acquisition.  In fact, I felt that working with the program helped me to understand and help my child with his English learning process.\n\nAlthough I like this learning style, I think it would be an improvement if there were an accompanying guide showing the meanings in English, Chinese characters, and pinyin.  A guide would also come in handy if you wanted to work separately with a tutor.  Then you could show the tutor a list of phrases and sentances you know so they could practice them with you.  For what you pay for this software, it would be nice.\n\nI do have one major complaint about the program - it is not adapted to Chinese.  From looking at the free downloads of each language of Rosetta Stone, it is clear that exactly the same concepts are taught in the same order in each language.  For example, The first four phrases you learn are \"a girl\", \"a boy\", \"a cat\", and \"a dog\", whether you are learning English or Swahili. The program is not adapted to the languages individually.\n\nThe concept behind the program is that only one new word or phrase is introduced at a time, and the accompanying illustration makes the meaning clear, so your mind can make the association.  The problem is that in Chinese the sentance structure can be very different than the Romance languages.  For example, in part six of lesson one, you see a picture of a man on a horse accompanied by the sentance \"yi ge qi zai ma shang de nan ren\".  Up till that point the only relevent phrases you have learned are \"A Man,\" and \"A Horse\".  In the English Rosetta Stone program, the phrase accompanying this picture is \"A man on a horse.\"  So clearly, the intention is that you learn the new word \"on\".  But, in Chinese the sentance is, literally translated, \"A riding located horse top man.\"  So the student is presented with three new words, \"riding\", \"located\", and \"top,\" with no clues to figure out what they mean either individually or in that sentance.\n\nI get the impression that they developed the template of this program to work well for the romance languages, and then just decided to make extra money by having translators translate the sentances into umpteen languages, regardless of whether the template works in those other languages.\n\nI think it would be a mistake for a beginner to try to learn Chinese using only this program - it would be very slow and frustrating.  But the program would be very helpful used in conjunction with a class or tutor.  I have not seen any similar programs out there that are better designed for Chinese, so it could be that Rosetta Stone is still your best bet if you like the interactive, total-immersion learning style.", "label": 2}

But then again, the 2001 version had something similar but just didn't have the one button option.  If you set this to scan on a set schedule, the one button feature is worthless.  Roxio's Go Back is only useful if you're not running XP or ME (XP and ME have their own restore feature).  Even if they didn't have this feature, I'm not even sure if I would use the Go Back feature.  Even though it's configurable, the standard configuration allocates 10% of the hard drive for GO Back.  It may be just me, but 10% seems to be a lot of space for one program.\nTo sum it up, if you have a previous version of systemworks, I don't recommend you buy this update (unless your anti-virus subscription is up).  If you don't have systemworks, this is worth buying.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I've been playing around with this latest version of the \"Complete National Geographic\" and have a few thoughts to share.\n\nI own one of the previous sets on CD-ROM. That set had a couple significant problems: You couldn't read the text of the articles, and all the magazines were scanned badly.\n\nThis set has solved the readability and resolution problems, but has introduced a few of its own.\n\nThe earlier issues of the magazine have their photographs printed vertically so that the whole height of the page was used to display landscape photographs. With the magazine, and the earlier set on CD-ROM, you could rotate the pictures on their side and enjoy the whole photo blown up to full, (although limited), resolution. This set has no such feature, so you have to tip your head to view the photo and read the caption, and worse still, the photo can be displayed no wider than your monitor is tall. You can zoom in on the picture for a better look, but it would have been nice to be able to rotate the pages so you could get a full screen view.\n\nAlso, the search function is a sorry joke on this set. It uses these funky dials to select your date range, (what is wrong with pull downs I ask?), so it is more difficult to select an exact date range. Also, when you get your results they are displayed in this \"carousel\" format with the newest results first and the oldest rotating off into the distance. What is wrong with a simple list view and a scroll bar???\n\nAs was mentioned in an earlier review, these search results are truncated, so you know nothing about the date, or the key words, or anything about the details of the results. A good search function is kinda important for a collection spanning 120 years, and this one is close to worthless.\n\nAh, just remembered something else about the search function. When you search for a particular brand name in the advertisements, clicking on the result takes you to the cover of the issue the ad is in rather than the exact page. Very annoying!\n\nSo, all in all, better than the old set in one very important way, the scans seem much improved, but the interface needs some serious work.\n\nI did notice that when I checked for updates it had already gone from version 1.12 to 1.15 in the short time since release. Maybe they will see the light and invest some effort into improving the interface. They have already got my money though, so I won't be holding my breath.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I've been using Dreamweaver (and it's predecessor Macromedia's UltraDev) for many years.  For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.

{"text": "I have appreciated and enjoyed Quicken ever since version 1.0. I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on upgrades. It has really helped me organize and monitor my finances. I used to be a fanatic Quicken fan--that is, until I purchased Quicken 2002 Deluxe. I found that the program ran much slower than the previous version, the net worth reports and graphs didn't work at all, and I cannot customize reports since I continue to get \"Not enough memory to customize reports\" error messages. Since I have 512M of RAM and Quicken is the only app open I don't believe this is my problem. I reported a bug for each of these problems and could find no information on the online help. I thought I would try and see if there was some patch or workaround direct from Intuit. Little did I know this was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Intuit.\nAfter some work I found the help numbers which stated there could be a $1.95/minute charge for assistance. However, if the problem was a defect the call would be at no charge. (That's for toll calls--toll free is $1.95/min from the start.) So far, so good. The operator who answered my call took down some information and told me I would need to give her my credit card number before speaking to the product support engineer, and that the engineer would make the determination whether this was a defect and then inform me that the timer was started. A bit leery, I passed along the credit card info and was connected. The engineer asked me if I was aware that a charge could apply to this call--I said yes, only after he started the timer. He then informed me he was starting the timer! You can imagine my frustration went instantly to the boiling point! I immediately told him the program was defective, that I was not going to pay $1.95/minute to help them figure it out, GOOD BYE! I am truly not the kind of person who hangs up on anyone, but with a problem that I believe a defect on their part, it was absolute insult to injury to have to pay for it.\n2002 Quicken buyers beware!

{"text": "After HERinteractive released their last game, I really thought that they were heading in a great direction.  Then this game came out to become one of my least favorites.\n\nStory-You are visiting a friend of a friend who owns an inn/restaurant.  She says that the reason she invited you over was for you to take some jewels back with you to put into your safe at home.  Before you can take them, however, they are stolen.  Whoo.  Thrills and chills.  This is the story.  Finding stolen jewels.  That's it.  And you never actually find them because during the game Nancy becomes distracted from her task to find another item which hasn't even been stolen!  This item is a will, by the way.\n\nGraphics-They were okay.  Thankfully, HERinteractive didn't try to put this game in black-and-white, but the backgrounds actually seemed worse to me than the others have.  Maybe because I just wasn't enjoying anything else, this seemed bad.  The characters look pretty good, though.  Oh!  But some of the locations you go (Phelps Print Shop, Tubby's Telegram Office, etc.) are just black-and-white snapshots.  Why didn't HER make them good, real locations?!?!\n\nSound-This is, like, 40's music.  It's not bad, and it definitely goes with the story.\n\nGameplay-There is one big change in gameplay.  You get to drive around in your car.  You can use the arrow keys or you can lead with the mouse, but you visit almost everywhere by car.  Also, no cell phone (it's 80 years ago, people!) so you have to give up money to use the pay phone to call your dad or Bess and George.  That's another thing.  You have to earn money in this game because you have to pay for stuff.  You have to get a job to earn money.  It's really not that bad, but I thought there were better ways to have let you make money.  First Person and point-and-click features are the same, though.\n\nFun-No it's not.  It's fun the first time through to figure out who the culprit is, but after that, the only replay value is to play mini golf.  I do replay it sometimes but not to the extent of the other games.\n\nLength-Playing it straight through takes about 9-10 hours.  It took me about a week to finish this game the first time.  It's an OK length, but after the last game I was expecting more.\n\nHERinteractive really regressed in this game.  I have to admit, though, the older fans of Nancy Drew will like this game, and some might find it a good way to start the series, but I think that die-hard fans should get this game only for $10 or cheaper while others should just skip this game for now.", "label": 2}

I read on Chief Architect's website that 3D Home Architect wasn't the \"real\" version 5.0 and that theirs was.  Given the trouble I was having with Broderbund's product editing the appearance of walls (where it had a mind of its own despite your settings) and the moving the view of 3D renderings which only occasionally worked, I bought into Chief Architect's claim that theirs was a superior product built by people who designed professional CAD products.\n\nMinutes after I installed Home Designer Duite 6.0, however, I was dissappointed: no multi-level designs!  Can you believe it?  Using 3D Home Architect, I was able to design a complex 8 level vacation home design.  It was really only a 3 floor design, but I had a sunken living room, double height cielings in the living room and a mezzanine level.  With this product you can only do very bland 2-3 floors without multiple \"levels\".  I imagine they purposefully restricted its usefulness in order to get you to buy their $500  version (which is still only a \"pro-sumer\" version) but 3D Home architect had this \"make or break\" functionality for under $100, so Chief Architect should too.\n\nI am very disappointed that Chief Arcitect didn't say how their product will not allow multi-level designs and I am going to see if they will give me my money back.  I had high hopes for this product and it let me down.\n\nOther features about the product seemed good, if a bit too simplistic.  It seems that their furnishing and terrain editing tools are superior to 3D Home Architect, but if you want to have an interesting house with multiple levels (meaning not only 3 standard height levels) you just can't buy this product.

{"text": "Its just what I have been looking for -- the whole textbook unabridged but maximized for interactive benefits by multimedia DVD-ROM.  While I value many of the features of QPunctureII, a similar product, this one simultaneous excels in its study tools for students and in its value as a reference for more experienced practitioners.  Searching and cross referencing is in fact much more rapid than in a standard printed text.  So after the first initial read, this is my favorite means to work with the material.  The printed text just can't implement all the features of the DVD.\n\nThere are well designed sections detailing out the anatomy of critical landmarks such as the spinous processes, ribs, and other bony landmarks.  It provides good coverage on precautions to take when needling near organs.  It contains both point-by-point information plus details of the major meridians, extraordinary points and chinese names.  Multi-media features include brief very good resolution videos of how to locate points on the human body plus chinese pronunciation of point names.  These are easily available at the touch of a link for every point.\n\nIt is quite flexible as a study tool, allowing one to practice locating points by identifying first the general body region, and then the underlying key anatomical structures that simulate what one would feel under the skin as depicted in the next deeper level of the drawing. (I wish it allowed one more optional layer for clarifying location of nearby nerves, blood vessels, muscles/ligament groups and their names -- with some way to rehearse these as well).  Practice tests can be configured as needed for studying particular meridians.  I especially like being able to contruct my own point combinations as desired for treating particular illnesses or regional pain problems.  One can focus this process to rehearse Chinese names, too.\n\nThe testing features makes studying more meaningful -- helps one identify where additional work is needed and builds confidence.  Given that every school seems to have a few of their own \"special\" pearls or point variations to learn -- it is extremely important to find a means to add in notes as well.  This program allows you to do so.\n\nDeadman's Textbook/DVD multimedia program has already proven to be one of my favorite essential resources.  I expect it to be a companion for a long to come.  Physicians acupuncturists will need to be mindful that the points are understandably determined by WHO international nomenclature, and there will be small variations in preferred locations for some individualized purposes.\n\nDRM Limitations\n\nI previously agreed with another reviewer here about frustration regarding the DRM limitations.  These WERE quite annoying.  HOWEVER, the developers of the software have been extremely attentive to our concerns.  They have subsequently developed a patch which corrects this problem and allows the program to run disc-free.  At first it glance, it seemed to be a bit cumbersome to install -- but actually was quite easy.  It does require that the full version of the software from the original disc be installed first -- which was not a problem for me as that is how I had been running it all along.  Then a brief online validation with a key the developers provide allows it to be unlocked.  If one needs to change to another computer there is a provision for uninstalling and then reinstalling somewhere else again.  This provides pretty much everything I had wished for.\n\nI am extremely grateful that Tom Kennedy and his team at JCM have provided their willingness to listen which led to the creation of this solution until the next version of the DVD is available.  You can write to them for the patch at: jcmdvdsupport(at)gmail.com\n\nThis patch has continued to work through the first several trial on my computer.  A few reboots, running other software and returning to MofA, as well as disconnecting from the internet after the initial registration/unlock was completed.  I am delighted to say that it is still working fine.\n\nI now wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.", "label": 1}
{"text": "My twins have mixed feelings about this game. They're 4 and while both enjoy it, they quickly tire of it. Since children have short attention spans that may play into it. It's also possible that the challenges aren't enough to keep them interested. I vote for the later as I've seen them walk away from it many times. It's the romance of interacting with Dora they enjoy more than the game itself. It's the familarity of the characters more than the challenges.\nThe sticker portion of the game is the most fun for my 4 year olds. They love to pull down the various characters and put them in odd places for a laugh. Your children will probably quickly be bored by level 1 so the challenges do increase a bit (particularly during the balloon portionof the game). I do dislike the fact that there's no CD-ROM case included as it's already been scratched a bit. There is an instruction booklet with an 800 # should you have issues or problems.\nThat's not to suggest it's all bad. There are a couple of adventures here that I've observed involve them more than others. There are problems with the software, however, and it should be noted. First, it's difficult to end the program once you get into it. You can't just exit. I realize this is to prevent children from accidently leaving the program but when I have to close it out to go on line or run another program it's annoying. I have to parade back to the beginning of the game. If you hit escape you don't leave and if you right click nothing happens. There's no icon for quitting the game or saving it where you are (although it apparently does save whatever previous game you were in although since I don't play it I can't confirm that).\nAlthough it's not perfect, Dora's Backpack Adventure does offer some distraction and learning opportunities for children. It's age range is appropriate though you should be prepared that they may be bored. They will more than likely come back to it either for the novelty of Dora's world or to try challenges they understand and can solve.", "label": 2}

It's abilities to send data to and from the GPS, along with what could be done with that data, were sufficient and useful.  All in all, a very useful product.\n\nHowever, despite it's advantages, I encountered numerous problems during the installation and while trying to use it.  For starters, the user manual is almost useless when it comes to installation.  It was written in a somewhat vague and imcomplete way in an attempt to cover the installation steps for multiple different MapSource products.  During initial install, it wanted to check for the GPS, but it could not find it, prompting me to select a serial COM port, despite that I was using a USB connection.  However, once installed, it saw the GPS without any problems.  It also did not appear to have any custom installation options.  Only \"Typical Installation\" was available as an option during the install.  The maps are stored on 3 separate disks that were not copied to the hard drive as I would have liked.  When I switch between east or west US, I am forced to switch disks.  I assume there is a way to fully install the maps to the hard drive, but I have yet to figure it out.  I would have expected it to be part of a \"Custom Installation\" option that it didn't seem to have.\n\nInstalled, If I attempt to use the Unlock Maps feature, it results in an error saying that it couldn't start the UnlockWizard and suggesting a reinstall of the application.  And the grand daddy of errors that you should never see in a product, selecting \"Check for Updates\" from the Help menu results in a fatal error.\n\nFinally, the product seperation and versioning is confusing.  It is difficult to tell what parts of the software are from USA Topo versus what parts are from other installed MapSource pieces, as they all get blurred into one.  This also makes the versions confusing, as looking at the version in the Help menu shows a different version than what is seen on the software packaging.\n\nAll of these problems make me very wary of what would otherwise be a fine product.  If they can refine it to where it is more user friendly and error free, I would recommend it.  But until then, I would only cautiously recommend it to the computer savvy who are used to dealing with random errors and working around them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "My husband and I bought this software from [a store].  I've used Printmaster and Microsoft Home Publishing Suite to create school newsletters.  The description on the Picture It box looked promising.  It convinced me that it was better than what I've been using.  I thought it would be perfect for our brand new super duper computer.  The time it took to install this software (the maximum installation) was tolerable.  However, this software has BIG PROBLEMS!  Picture It kept crashing (\"illegal operation, must be shut down\").  When we ran \"windoctor\" to find out what the error was about, it said that there was a missing file (that, or it could not access it).  The file was a Picture It \"dll\" file.  When we ran all 7 discs through \"find file\" command, no such file could be found either.  We consulted the Microsoft customer service, and we uninstalled and reinstalled many times using different techniques that were told to us by Microsoft customer service people.  The problems didn't go away, and even created more problems. Sometimes, even when we were only sending an e-mail, we'd get a pop-up message that said we needed to put the Picture It disc in the drive (really strange!).  On one other installation, the image icons would not appear.  Eventually, we returned the software to [the store], and then bought another Picture It, hoping that maybe we had a bad box the first time.  The second Picture It box we bought had the same problems.  We tried installing on our other computers (we have four computers in the house), but the same problem existed.  We returned the second box, and we don't intend to buy a third.  Good luck with it if you buy one!!!", "label": 0}

{"text": "This version of Complete Nation Geographic is vastly improved over the original set. The most important thing is the viewability of the scanned pages and this set does not disappoint. The original version left much to be desired, but these newly scanned images are bright and tack sharp. I appreciated that you could zoom in up to 2X and the text or photo stayed sharp. Indicative of high quality scans. The earlier set consisted of 30 CDs and you were constantly swapping them in and out. This new version has been condensed to 6 DVDs. Even better, you can copy the DVDs to your hard drive and cruise from 1888 to 2008 without touching a disc. Nice touches are the inclusion of a search feature and a very handy bookmarking tool. Another nice touch is the ability to print a single page or double page spread.\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, there is one flaw in an otherwise superb set. And that is the omission of a rotation feature. Many pictures were printed across the page and difficult to see. You can always print the page, or turn your head but this should have never happened. National Geographic says a fix is on the ways, but as of 1/24/10, not yet. Even with the rotation glitch, the overall quality and enjoyment merit a five star rating.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The Encyclopedia Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition (formerly \"Student and Home Edition\") builds on the success of its completely revamped previous editions in 2006-10. The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).\n\nThe Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.\n\nIn its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.\n\nWhen you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's \"search\" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy \"Virtual Notecards\". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.\n\nThe new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.\n\nRegrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.\n\nSpeaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.\n\nThe Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.\n\nThe Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.\n\nThe Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.\n\nThe Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the \"Personal Brain\" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.\n\nThe Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, \"how to\" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.\n\nIronically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).\n\nStill, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.\n\nThe current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.\n\nThe Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.\n\nSome minor gripes:\n\nThe atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?\n\nDespite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.\n\nBut that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.\n\nWith the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

{"text": "This is a nice distro, with several aspects of polish.  However, as other reviewers have noted, if you need support resolving any installation issues, you'd better be a Linux guru or at least know one.  I agree with others; SuSe tech support puts out more effort trying to find ways of NOT providing you support than helping you to solve any problems you encounter.\n\nLet's face it, Micro$oft's dominance of the market means few hardware vendors even bother to attempt Linux support.  The Open Source community does an excellent job overcoming this hurdle, but often installation has its hiccups.  That's where a distro's tech support becomes vital; to guide you through the catacombs of Linux to find the appropriate config file to tweak.\n\nIn my experience with SuSe, they refuse to support my modem; a basic ISA modem which SuSe did not recognize.  I wiped SuSe off my disk, installed Red Hat and had zero problems.\n\nI've seen many comments on the Web suggesting that SuSe is no longer the customer-oriented company they once were since they have been acquired by Novell.

{"text": "(Added 12/13. Unlike another reviewer's claim, I find no problem for this 2005 version working with Bank of America and ING bank accounts (using qfx). The upgrade was smooth for me, other than the problem below...)\n\nI upgraded from 2003 to this 2005 version.  The major surprise is that it no longer support importing qif files for savings/checking/IRA/investment accounts.  It is still made to support qif download for credit card accounts if it is not serving web connect files, but this will also be gone for credit card accounts by the 2006 version, Intuit says.\n\nIt said the change is to gradually fade out the 10-yr old qif format, and such warning notices are found in their 2004 versions, and on their website.  But I upgraded from 2003, and who would check their website for these kind of notice?!  Well, maybe you would, but not me.  So, I am stranded with a couple of credit union accounts no longer capable of electronic download via qif.  I figure there are four options:\n\n(i) type them in by hand,\n(ii) downgrade back to 2003,\n(iii) wait for the bank/credit union to support qfx (quicken web connection), or\n(iv) set up a mirror account as a cash account (credit card and cash accounts are the only ones allowed to have qif import), so the intelligent quicken software will let you import qif files.\n\nOtherwise, I am not seeing a lot of difference between the 2003 and 2005 versions. The look and feel is still about the same as 2003; I haven't found a lot of difference in features otherwise.\n\nOne of the reasons I choose to upgrade is that my JP morgan/chase credit cards downloads now give you a qif file if you choose quicken 2003 or earlier, while it gives you a qfx file for quicken 2004 or later.  So i thought my 2003 version is a little outdate.  It turns out, before I upgrade to 2005, I tried and successfully use the qfx file from jp/chase on my quicken 2003!\n\nafterall, this is a free software (with turbotax purchase), can't complain too much.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This course is a nice, gentle introduction to Chinese and it is fun.  You see four pictures on the screen and hear an accompanying word or phrase. Each section has ten of these four-picture sets.  There is no explanation or translation in English. You have to figure out from the picture what they new word or phrase means. Sometimes it takes a while to figure out what it means, but with a little patience, you do figure it out and it sticks with you.  Some of the pictures are a bit unclear, but in general they are good.  The audio is also good and the course is user friendly. Once you think you have learned a section you can take a quiz.\n\nOn the whole, however, I think there are better courses out there.  This one is very expensive and doesn't really take you very far.  While it does teach a lot of vocabulary and things like comparatives and location, you don't really learn to say anything you would want to when visiting China.  You learn to say \"The taxi is red\" or \"The taxi has two windows\" which are good things to learn.  But you don't learn to say \"Where can I find a taxi?\" or \"How long does it take to get to X?\"\n\nIf you want a slow and easy introduction to listening and speaking, the Pimsleur introductory course is much cheaper (although the full Pimsleur courses are quite expensive.)Once you have finished the Pimsleur introduction, something like Ultimate Mandarin Basic course works well.\n\nRosetta Stone is good for learning Chinese characters.
