{"text": "When I first heard this record, I thought \"yeah, I can dig this\" (I do not really talk like this). Then I got sort of bored. I think maybe it's because quiet really IS the new loud--there are more and more bands that just sound the same as Belle and Sebastian, or (in the States) Elliott Smith. To be honest, KC don't really add much to the sound that Nick Drake mastered with Pink Moon, 25 years ago--and Nick Drake did it better than they do.\nWith that said, this record has grown on me. While the Kings are covering familiar territory, they do so beautifully (extended metaphor deleted). They could write better lyrics. They could be more ambitious. But they seem like good guys, and I like some songs on this album a lot. They stayed with me. That's a good feeling, that's what art or music or whatever is supposed to do, and grumbling about their lack of originality won't take that away.\nI like this album. Very catchy and very well done, nice quiet music that will help you sleep and give you pleasant dreams.\nThank you.", "label": 2}

Though this time with added theatrical flair and the return of guitarist Dick Wagner. Cooper continued to assume new identities, such as the famed swordsman of \"Zorro's Ascent\" and the put-upon son of \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song).\" Some of the performances seem labored, and Wagner's distinctive guitar riffs feel as if they were grafted onto the songs to add flash. The stagey ballad \"I Am the Future\" might have worked well as a production number, but with Cooper descending back into alcohol addiction there was no tour. What works well is Cooper's humor on \"No Baloney Homosapiens,\" \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere.\" And on \"Tag, You're It\" he indulges his longtime love of cheesy cinema with a song full of slasher-film clichs. If there was no 1970s legacy with which to compare this, one might stumble upon this and think it's a long-lost power-pop album from a surprisingly talented lyricist. It's all quite listenable, and even fun as it passes by, but it's not nearly as memorable as his earlier (and some of his later) works. Collectors' Choice's domestic reissue adds the UK-only 1982 single \"For Britain Only,\" and its four-panel booklet includes new liner notes by Gene Sculatti. [2010 hyperbolium dot com]", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have a good amount of nostalgia related to LMIP.  This was the first JB album I owned after being introduced to his work in the early 90s as a teenager. Generally, I always have liked the collection and thought that it was tuneful enough.  But after becoming familiar with his older works, and even albums such as One Particular Harbour (which was only 2 years old when this was released), LMIP doesn't quite measure up.  The main issue with Mango is that many of the songs seem too formula, and not very Jimmy.  The playing by the band is too often very safe, and almost too note perfect to feel like they have much personality.  This album also comes at a time when Jimmy seemed preoccupied (or perhaps his record label) with scoring on the country charts.  While songs like Everybody's On The Run, The Perfect Partner, and Please Bypass This Heart, aren't necessarily bad, they are fairly color-by-numbers country lite songs without much of a personal touch.  It's almost as if Jimmy is singing someone else songs even though he gets a writing credit on all three.  The best songs are where Jimmy's personality and tried and true storytelling are able to come thru:  Frank and Lola, Last Mango In Paris and Jolly Mon Sing.  Jimmy must have thought that these were the best too, as they were still included in his set during the recording of Feeding Frenzy Live, five years later.\nIt seems LMIP may have been mostly a marketing move by MCA after all.  With the next year's Floridays, Jimmy makes a cryptic reference as to the record being the last one of a contractual agreement.  Including such artists as Michael Bolton on backing vocals (Beyond The End), only seem to verify this claim.  However, if you can overlook some of the overtly commercial moments on LMIP, it will be an enjoyable listen, and a relic very much of it's time.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.\nBut you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.\nThe problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.\nI thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of \"Brown Skin\" or the gutsy self-confidence of \"Video\"?  Where's the humanity of \"Ready for Love\" or the philisophical punch of \"I See God In You\"?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of \"We Are the World\" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.\nGreat playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.\nThe shining track here is \"The One\" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Chicago is my favorite band of all time but the way they have conducted their career for the past 15 years has baffled me. Considering how \"left field\" they were when they started out it has been sad to see them turn into business men concerned only with the bottom line of Chicago Music Inc.\n\nWith Chicago XXX they play it far beyond safe. The first half of the album is loaded with ballads of the \"Look Away\" variety. Look Away is the song that got me interested in the band (I'm only 27) but I have since discovered their Columbia catalogue and it would have been nice to see them try to make a more adventurous record.\n\nLuckily the the second half of the record rocks a lot harder (rocks being a relative term). The guitars drive the second half with the horns buried too far in the mix. However, the guitar is my biggest complaint. Keith Howland has an extremly limited role on this album. Since he joined the band over ten years ago he has been increasing shoved up front in concert, with him taking several lead vocals. On this album he doesn't even sing backgrounds, doesn't get any song writing credits and worst of all they brought in a session guitarist (Dan Huff) to play on about half the record. Drummer Tris Imboden who has been with the band since 1991 is replaced by outside musicians on four tracks. Jimmy Pankow who wrote some of the bands biggest hits (Colour My World, Make Me Smile) doesn't receive any song writer credits.\n\nI would not call this a band effort, it comes across as a commitee designed attempt to get back on adult contemporary\n\nradio. The first single \"Feel\" is already receiving a good amount of airplay but it has no chance of crossing over to Top 40. There are several songs that would have had a better shot at getting Top 40 airplay like \"King of Might Have Been\" or \"Caroline\". The fact that the album was released by Rhino doesn't help either. Rhino is known as a reissue label they have never had much success with original material.\n\nI think I'm done ranting now.

{"text": "Paul McCartney ramrodded this benefit concert for the heroes of the World Trade Center catastrophe, and this is the soundtrack for the four-hour concert originally televised on VH-1.  Top-heavy with aging rock icons, this album (along with the upcoming \"America: A Tribute to Heroes\") begs the question: Why, in a time of crisis, does anyone think we need classic rock to salve our national wounds?\nMaybe the answer is that the established rock acts were probably the most willing to lend a hand to a cause.  And on \"The Concert for New York City,\" they come off the best.  David Bowie's version of Simon and Garfunkel's \"America\" is a nice moment, and it kicks off this double CD.  Bon Jovi stumbles with yet another version of \"Livin' On a Prayer\" (hey, won't this be on the other benefit CD?) as does Eric Clapton with his quasi blues \"Hoochie Coochie Man.\"  Destiny's Child turns in a nice \"Emotion\" and a tedious \"Gospel Medley\" while the Goo Goo Dolls and Backstreet Boys get lost in the shuffle.  The less said about Melissa Etheridge's two songs, the better. Probably the emotional highlight of Disc 1 is Billy Joel's \"New York State of Mind\" (hey, won't this be on the other benefit CD?).\nThe real jackpot for rock fans is Disc 2, with a fiery three songs offered by The Who, peaking with a thunderous \"Won't Get Fooled Again.\"  Next up is Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (along with the \"Late Night with David Letterman\" band) doing the Stones classic \"Miss You.\"  Two emotional peaks on this disc: James Taylor doing \"Fire and Rain\" and Five for Fighting doing \"Superman.\"  John Mellencamp runs through his current hit \"Peaceful World\" and offers \"Pink Houses\" as a duet with Kid Rock (huh?).  McCartney himself appears with two songs excised from his eight songs he performed on TV (he did two from his new album and an extra run-through of the ultra-cheesy \"Freedom\").  \"I'm Down\" is very nice rock and roll while \"Yesterday\" and the group-sing \"Let It Be\" are kind of a let-down.\nThankfully this CD did not include all of the lame comedy bits and goofy celebrity speeches (remember Richard Gere?) from the TV concert.

This disc is top of the line when it comes to sound.\nAs for the songs themselves--\"The Girl From Ipanema\" has become a standard.

So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss \"Earth Song\" and the duet \"Scream\" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original \"Thriller\" album, and even more from \"Bad\". Plus we get the best of \"Off The Wall\", and again some of his earliest stuff.

I don't even mean \"one riff sounded Kornish\" or \"this chorus sounds Korn-like\", but the SONG AS A WHOLE.\n\nThere are moments of their past glory scattered about an album which is, as a whole, mostly commercial nu-metal pop trash. As an example, while I like chocolate, I don't especially like feces with chocolate chunks mixed in.\n\nA tolerable album, but mediocre and a slap in the face to their previous work.

{"text": "I have been listening to Soilwork for years, and my opinion on Soilwork is that they are one of the best bands out there. Although the pinnacle of their albums was definitely A Predator's Portrait, they have evolved quite a bit since. Realistically, there is only so much you can do with a certain sound, such as the crunching sound of the fast and sharp sound of A Predator's Portrait and Steelbath Suicide, even though I can never tire of those two.  They did all the guitar solos and screaming with Steelbath and Portrait and then along came Natural Born Chaos.  As with Figure Number Five, there was a definite direction towards the more predictable, and in essence, a \"poppier\" sound. It may be a double-edged sword in that staying with what they were good at would've become old eventually or that in taking a different approach they would lose some fans. I would say this album is a mix between the old and the new.  Seems like a logical step, right?\n\n Maybe I am bias towards certain albums because, myself being a longtime drummer, I tend to lean towards the albums with the greatest drummwork talent. Stabbing the Drama definitely shows the unbelievable talent of their newest studio drummer, Dirk Verbeuren.  Henry Ranta was definitely the man for all their previous albums but I believe FN5 was a shameful album in which talent was sacrificed for what certain people wanted to hear. Soilwork is a band to listen to for drumming alone, especially Stabbing the Drama, good luck keeping up.\n\n As far as Stabbing the Drama goes overall, it's definitely a step up from Figure #5, and the melodic and phrase structure creates a good head-nodding experience.\n\n There is also an obvious display of influences on the band, as this can also be observed in many of the interviews of Strid circulating on the Internet.\n\n This album is definitely among the \"keepers\" of all the Soilwork albums, mainly because it is a new approach to the Soilwork sound.\n\n My only regret about this album is it just doesn't hold my interest as far as intricacy and odd timing goes. I'm not sure if this album was a rushed project that was poured over by raw talent or a well-thought out album that was pleasently graced by an amazing drummer.\n\n This is going to be an album that its listenability and long-lasting impression will have to be seen by those whose taste is that of structured but articulated metal.\n\n Although I said this is a 3- 3.5 star record, don't let that spoil your thoughts: go and listen to a couple of Soilwork's albums like A Predator's Portrait or Steelbath Suicide and Natural Born Chaos (to get a taste of the different spectrums the albums are on), and then listen to Stabbing the Drama, and be open to the fact that bands may evolve their sound over time.", "label": 2}

The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled with old favorites and also a treat to listen too, although not as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful.\n\nAs I said it has been some years since I listened to this album, and although it has been 20 something years, putting this CD on, just swept me away and it is for me as wonderful today as it was when I first heard it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.\n\nCD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the \"Thriller\" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as \"ABC\" and \"I Want You Back\", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include \"State of Shock\" or \"Lovely One\" instead of \"Enjoy Yourself\". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 \"Thriller\" album tracks (the other 2 being \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when \"radio tracks\" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.\n\nCD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from \"Bad\" and 7 from \"Dangerous\", and finishes off with \"You Are Not Alone\" from HIStory and \"You Rock My World\" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is \"Scream\", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.\n\nIn the end, this \"essential\" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!", "label": 1}

The version of \"Let It Be\" with Eric Clapton on guitar was definitely the musical highlight of the night (the real highlight was Hilly Clinton getting overwhelmingly and deservedly booed followed closely by the booing of Ricky Gere). The sets by the Who and Bon Jovi were also highlights as was the duo version of \"Your Song\" by Elton John and Billy Joel (curiously and annoyingly left off this cd release).\nAnd that brings me to the primary complaint (and the reason for the three star rating): Too much good stuff left off and too much horrible stuff kept. Example: The booing of Hilly and Ricky. Should have been left on. The John/Joel duo. Should've been left on. The \"performances\" by the following \"artists\" should've been left off: Jay-Z, Destiny's LooooveChild, Adam Sandler, and the Backdoor Boys. Basically, disc one could be skipped altogether and replaced with the repeated booings of Hilly and Gerbil.\nOverall, disc two is an emotional keeper and almost makes up for the horrible stuff on disc one.

They are songs of genuine conviction and reverence and commitment.\n\nI have no problem with songs like this, but I would love to hear Casting Crowns sing a few songs that can bring a smile to my face, rather than move me to tears. Something celebratory...even cheerful, would we welcomed! Their last effort-- Lifesong-- was a similar collection of intense tunes. And the only song on their debut CD that made you really feel good was \"Praise You With the Dance.\"\n\nI really love this group and their sound and their message, but I think they need to brighten things up a bit.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I like many others jumped on the Anvil bandwagon when they were in the process of promoting their movie. To be fair I purchased a few of their albums starting with a few from the beginning and a few at the end including \"This is Thirteen.\" Much credit I will admit should be given to Anvil for there will to survive and drive to succeed amidst undoubtedly insurmountable odds, especially like it was circa 1981-87 and most importantly now. Unfortunately, it's evident that for what they contain in intestinal fortitude they lack in talent and creativity. I really felt bad for them when I saw the movie as it was really evident that they are in severe denial like an ugly Hollywood socialite who thinks her career has a chance when, in reality, her only chance at success is to receive a handout and beg for a better life Anvil pimped themselves out and begged for a better life instead of just admitting they sucked and remained in Canada to work in their day jobs while playing local gigs. They would have been much better off.\n\nThis is Thirteen is no better than their first album. One would expect that after 20 plus years of practice they would have progressed as a band and sadly that has not occurred.", "label": 0}

Then came World Without Tears, which featured again some fine singing, but as far as songwriting and musical production went, I ranked it as a not entirely successful experiment. In retrospect however, after hearing West, it looks to me like the first sign of creative burnout.\n\nWest is, and I'm very sad to say it as a Lucinda fan, the product of an exhausted force. It feels like an empty bottle. It's heartbreaking to see her standing so naked, with nothing to say in the lyrics and not a melodic idea to conceal it. Even her voice sounds affected, mannered, resembling a sound-alike doing a Lucinda parody.\n\nLucinda made a wrong decision. At this point in her artistic life, while mourning her mother's death, she should have taken a creative break rather than turning her sorrow into this gloomy, repetitive and ultimately boring lament. Obviously, Williams is not one of those musicians satisfied with churning out more of the same on every new record. She wants to renew and reinvent herself.

Will either of them have you hip-hopping arond the tree?\n\nThe Merry Mixmas crew would seem to have the advantage of pulling from the vast EMI catalogue for classic source material by artists such as Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Nancy Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald and Lou Rawls (most original tracks are from the excellent Ultra-Lounge Christmas Cocktails collections). There are some noted remixers/DJs/whatever involved that even I have heard of including MJ Cole, Q-Burns, and Ursula 1000.\n\nThere are a few standout tracks, like Bent's dreamily ambient take on Bingo's \"Winter Wonderland\" and PSapp's vocal twist on Les Brown's \"I've Got My Love to Keep me Warm.\" The overall result, however, is a surprisingly bland collection of remixes that are so respectful and similar to the originals that they are almost redundant. The formula for almost every remix is to let the original vocal track play through with little or no change while adding a subtle layer of techno drum, bass, and synth effects resulting in a tastefully updated electronic variation -- but not a radically transformed new creation. The one remix that diverts substantially from the original turns out to be a tortured re-casting of Nancy Wilson's \"The Christmas Waltz\" into 4/4 time (or does awayTEAM not know how to program 3/4 beats into a drum machine?) Otherwise, it all goes down a little too easy with few surprises, shocks, or smiles... it's basically a remix album that even your grandmother might like -- but is that really what you want out of a remix album? Besides, she'll enjoy Chirstmas Cocktails a lot more... and so do I.\n\nDecision: Christmas Remixed 2 (break)beats Merry Mixmas, y'all... word (and so forth...)

Their concert to promote this album wasn't bad either--who else would perform on stage with a cardboard Chewbacca?  Hence my complaint about the Deluxe Edition of their excellent album--why so little?  Yes there is a disk's worth of B-sides, but when you get down to it, there are only six real B-cuts here whereas the rest are rehashes.  There are many other deluxes out on the market that bury this one in content choice and quality:  check out the Marvin Gaye releases or The Who's Leeds and My Generation albums.  Surely they could have found more alternate studio takes, and concert cuts, especially \"Undone\" (my personal fav); it's a shame about the lack of concert versions, because \"Jonas\" and \"Surf Wax\" to use a reviewer's cliche', really capture their onstage energy.  Although I've never been big on them in general, the demos definitely reflect a rawer, more garagey side of the band, especially with \"Paperface\" and \"Lullaby For Wayne\".

I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?\n\nAmy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.\n\nAll in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C\n\nPrice: C+\n\nRemastering: B-\n\nOverall: C 1/2+", "label": 2}

They were at my first Texas Jam back in 1980.  Please understand that I love these guys, but this album...NOT.\n\nThe 5 reviews on the re-realease are all raves, but take the time to go back further to the dissenting voices on the reviews of the earlier versions of this album.\n\nSome folks pegged this dead-on as a studio album cash-in where the BOC are only guests or sideplayers on their own album.  I found the great majority of the arrangements boring and the tongue-in-cheek, wink-and-a-nudge weird humor is missing. I saw the guys live a couple of years after this came out and don't recall them playing any of these songs.  That should tell you something.\n\nIt's not a BAD album, it's just not good --- much less their best.  There's at least a half dozen albums better than this one.  If you are a BOC newbie, then skip this one and get (in vaguely chronological order):\n  - Blue Oyster Cult (self-titled first album)\n  - Secret Treaties*\n  - Spectres\n  - Some Enchanted Evening** (Live)\n  - Cultosaurus Erectus\n  - Fire of Unknown Origin\n  - Revolution by Night\nNote(*): Features the original and far-superior version of Astronomy, which is re-done on Imaginos\nNote(**): Features live version of Astronomy which is also better than Imaginos version\n\nIF you love all those AND are a completist, THEN you might consider picking this one up.

{"text": "This is the only Michael Jackson CD I have in my collection (along with a couple of Jackson 5 & Jacksons compilations). The depth of music here is remarkable and it's appropriate that his early J5 era is included in this set. I can only describe tracks like \"ABC\" & \"I Want you Back\" as simply joyous (as I describe most of Motown's music). I only have \"Off The Wall\" & \"Thriller\" on LP at this point and have felt for the time being that this collection is sufficient. That may change soon though I wasn't overly convinced about \"Bad\" or \"Dangerous\" upon their releases. I recall thinking upon the issue of the \"Bad\" video that Michael apparently took 5 years to remake \"Beat It\". Other tracks like \"Heal The World\" sounded like a limp re-write of \"We Are The World\", a little too sugary for my tastes..but that's me.\nHaving said that there is plenty of power and scope in the music and many new rules were re-written by MJ to set new standards in Pop/Funk music. Like many, I lament the omission of \"Scream\" with Janet Jackson, but \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", \"Thriller\", \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\", \"Man In The Mirror\" to name but a few are now all radio classics. This collection really IS ESSENTIAL as it's title suggests.\nWe've now lost Michael. The sad thing is it took his passing to remind us all of how great an entertainer he was because for a really long time there it seemed his music had become a sad afterthought lost in the relentless tabloid reportings of his \"bizarre lifestyle\"..some of this was self-inflicted by Michael himself somewhat naively...most of it however wasn't.\nAll we have left now is the music...that's really all that matters in the end.

{"text": "Well here in the U.S. of A. people only think what the mainstream media tell them so when someone is found \"not guilty\" in the court of law after CNN and NBC and such folk demonize them for so long (a decade for Michael Jackson) the public don't understand and think that the court system has failed them.  Of course they don't get all of the facts but what do CNN and NBC and the mainstream media care about pesky little details such as that?  Why should they be held responsible for anything that they say and do?  After all they have gotten away with making sure that the U.S. lose every single war for the past sixty years someone of Michael Jackson's stature won't mean a thing to the public.  Also when your own record company such as Sony actively sabatoges you as being a \"has been\" who does not sell any more or record great songs anymore there isn't much one can do.  \"Invincible\" only sold eight million copies worldwide and only debuted at number one in the U.S. and in thirteen countries so obviously Michael could not compete against anyone else in the industry.  Of course the public in the U.S. did not have to know about any of this as they were only told the U.S. sales which were only a million or so copies.  Therefore they got an entirely different picture of the story of what was really the situation.  So the public were not interested any more and were told to instead support artists such as Eminem.\n\nAlong with the fact that this (\"The Essential Michael Jackson\") was the EIGHTH compilation (the first three were \"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\", \"Greatest Hits: HIStory - Volume I\", and \"The Number Ones\") and the fifth (the next four were \"The Very Best Of The Jacksons\", \"The Essential Jacksons\", \"The Jacksons' Story\", and the career overview box set \"The Ultimate Collection\") released during Michael's trial over the past two years there wasn't any reason for anyone to care about an artist who did not \"sell like he use to\" so the industry and media decided for you that promotion was not needed.  SO once again this product \"only\" sold three million copies at the time (which meant six million sold worldwide because it is a two c.d. set) but it was not until forty-eight hours into Michael's death that the American public followed their marching orders from the mainstream media and decided, \"Oh!  He WAS pretty good and not so horrible after all!\".  Wow!  Talk about bad luck for real huh?  All that success just a couple of days into your death and you can't benefit from it at all!  Neat, huh?  Of course the mainstream media don't have to bear any responsibility with that because it is not like you are going to do anything about it!  Bwaah, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!  So AFTER he died in the following year it sold another four million copies (which counted as eight million discs since it is a double c.d. set) and to this day it is the best selling compilation of the \"Essential...\" series Sony have been doing since around the turn of the century.  (Worldwide sales since the end of 2009 are of seven and half million copies which is a total of fifteen million discs sold.)\n\nAlso this compilation does NOT include all of the Jackson 5 hits, Jacksons hits, or solo hits as a child solo recording artist, and not even all of them for him as an adult solo recording artist.  It would take five discs to do that.  Equivalent to or more than anyone else with all due respect to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Mariah Carey, and The Beatles.  Of course no one will sell as well as Michael in the future at this point because the music industry is gone in comparison to what it was around the turn of the twentieth to twenty first centuries.  Industry does not exist very well when everyone has stolen your product through the internet.  BUT with that said and since no one cares these two discs are the most expansive compilation to date (not including the 2004 box set \"The Ultimate Collection\" which was a generic budget compilation that did not cover all of his hits or best of tracks either; and nor should have it) also not including \"The Collection\" which was a limited edition box set released in the U.K. containing five of his seven studio l.p.s as an adult solo recording artist or \"The Indispensible Collection\" which is only available at this point elsewhere as a digital download only.\n\nIt should also be noted that this compilation is unique from all others (not including the \"King Of Pop\" 2008 compilation that had TWENTY SIX different tracklistings depending on which country it was released in; the U.S. did not get a version released because he was long considered by the mainstream media, and public as a \"has been\" who was no longer able to create and sell worthwhile product anymore) and is a \"hybrid compilation\" because it includes edits, remixes, and original studio l.p. versions.  It is also different from all others (again, not including any of the \"King Of Pop\" versions) being that one like this is  not available anywhere else.\n\nThe reason this compilation as well as others by other recording artists does not include all of the hits is so that the customer still has to purchase either more product such as one other song or many other products such as multiple songs or the l.p.s (albums) themselves.  I think that this is fine (great business) and fascinating as well.  There were many adult solo recordings that were hits that were not included in this set whether it was \"We Are The World\", \"Stranger In Moscow\", \"Give In To Me\", \"History (remix)/Ghosts\", \"Gone Too Soon\", \"Why\", \"Butterflies\", \"Somebody's Watching Me\", \"Liberian Girl\", \"Scream\", \"Blood On The Dance Floor\", \"Cry\", \"They Don't Care About Us\", \"Girlfriend\", \"Earth Song\", \"Childhood\", \"Ease On Down The Road\", and \"Jam\".  (Yes the \"3.0\" version of this compilation had some of these tracks but that is now out of print, rare, did not get fully distributed, and did not contain a full running time third disc as it only had seven regular running length tracks on it.)\n\n...and since no one can count, pays attention to details, or cares about me acknowledging this at all this release actually has THIRTY-EIGHT tracks on it even though the sticker on the front of it when you get it says thirty-seven tracks are on it and other reviewers have expressed that as being the total as well.

{"text": "I am a hardocre Springfield fan who buys everything the first day it coes out.  On Rock of Life I noticed that his voice was changing a little for the worse but it was a great album with top notch songs. Then Rick took a long break before Karma, which was also a great record, but his voice was still a little rough.  It didn't bother me though because he still could hit the range of notes that was needed for each song.  SDAA was a tough, harder edged record that was not nearly as captivating as Karma but had it's own seductive style. Now the new record is so disappointing compared to those previous releases.  All the songs are slower or mid tempo numbers and it gets kind of boring.  The worst part however, is Rick's voice.  My wife was with me in the car when I had this CD in and she said \"My God, what happened to his voice?\"  I replied that I don't know, maybe too many nights singing in smokey casinos, but I definitely agree that his voice is shot.  It actually works on \"Under the Milky Way\" because it's more of a \"talk\" song versus actually singing. But it is horrible on \"Human\" and \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\".  When he gets background vocals or the vocals are double tracked it really helps his performance.

All the pieces are clear and inspiring, keeping you mindful of Jackson's innate talent and vocal abilities.  I think he took some chances with his singing in the 80's, keeping his voice soft in some areas, then bringing it to screaming pitches and cries to get certain emotions across.  He was an incredibly shy person, seeming to want so much to belong to some special person...  In the lyrics, you can hear him psyching himself into the success of his career.  He is also doing a lot of celebrating! The songs and melodies keep you moving; amazing Jackson's use of African beats and chanting, too.  The ballad-type songs are soothing; the beat-box songs are best cranked-up as loud as possible!  I love Michael Jackson, daring you to stop being a wallflower - \"and, get your-self off the wall...\"\n\nA great outlet to manage your anger - just sing along!  \"I'm Bad\", \"Beat It!\" \"Thriller\" and \"Dirty Diana\" etc etc!", "label": 1}

{"text": "All this \"give it four or five.. or ten listens to understand it and discover its depths\" is pure nonsense. True, for some OTHER bands, repeated listenings may often be a necessary requirement. But the thing that made TON stand out from all that was that their lush, layered, through-the-darkness beautiful arrangements smacked you over the head the {FIRST} time through. And only got all the better from that point on.  And that's why this album fails so badly. A good majority of this album sounds like B-side jams/riffs/punk-angst odes.. lifted from previous albums (not the better parts of those albums I may add) - We've heard this before. Not only once, but a number of times actually. Equally bad, though Pete may never have been a Morrison/Morrissey/Beatles In the lyrics department exactly, he's never been quite as banal as some of the stuff to be found lurking around here.\n\nAm I supposed to believe that with ten or more listenings the 'reheated-jams' here will suddenly evoke the atmospheric arrangements I know and love from previous TON?  That the lyrics will suddenly morph into something akin to Shakespeare? I don't think so.  Despite that, I have all their other albums to listen to and enjoy. And I'm still a big fan - as I know they can do a lot better than this. As for 'Ol Rasputin here, I'm indeed tossing him back in his moldy little grave where he belongs, and letting him be.. 'Dead Again'. ;O)", "label": 0}
{"text": "I guess I should have downloaded this album first, but Type O was one of those bands I thought I could always count on to at least deliver something moderately enjoyable. When I first bought this and popped it in my car's cd player, I was surprised that the opening track sounded so lame. I stuck with it though and went track by track, never finding a single song that sounded like the Type O that I know.\n\nI gave it two more tries, and each time I just couldn't tolerate it. I put it away for a couple months and tried again today, and I think it actually sounds a bit worse.\n\nOK, let me make this simple; to me, October Rust was perfect. I enjoy the entire cd, every single song. World Coming Down was great, I thought about 70% of it was excellent. Then Life is Killing Me came out and I thought it was rather disappointing and didn't care for the direction they were going in, but I still enjoyed about 30% of it. This new cd sounds like the worst parts of Life is Killing Me stretched out over an entire cd.

{"text": "50 Cent's first album released since having attained massive name recognition does not disappoint.  You know what you're going to get, and, if you include the bonus cuts, you get 18 tracks' worth of it.  \"It\" is 50's lazy-yet-infectious flow over melodic-yet-rugged beats, with lyrical content ranging from macho posturing to macho posturing.  Anybody who would mention such output in the same breath as Illmatic, Ready to Die, Nation of Millions, or any other bona fide classic probably became a Hip Hop head five minutes ago when they first saw Eminem on MTV.\nThat said, this is a thoroughly entertaining album.  When the beats are hitting, which is the case on most tracks, 50's aforementioned flow riding the beat is enough to get your head nodding and keep you entertained.  Standout tracks include Don't Push Me, Many Men, and Back Down.  At this point, dissing Ja Rule is about as daring a move as 3rd Bass dumping on Vanilla Ice in \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" but the beat is nice, and the disses are appropriately personal.\nThe downside to this album is that when the beats are lacking, the monosyllabic simplicity of 50's lyrical style and repetitive content aren't enough to carry a track.  One need only listen to P.I.M.P. to understand where I'm coming from.  Additionally, 50 is not a great singer, and so the fact that he insists on singing on every hook is unfortunate.\nIn sum, is you like 50, you'll like this, and if you don't, he's not going to convert you with Get Rich or Die Tryin'.  Then again, given that he sold a staggering 872,000 copies in less than a week, I doubt he's too worried about converts.  A little less singing, and the elimination of a few extraneous tracks would have tightened up the album, but in the final analysis, this is still worth copping.\n3.5/5", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is an album the Blue Oyster Cult fans will really get into, a concept album that showcases the bands unique song stylings. For the casual listener, or sometime BOC fan, stick with \"Agents of Fortune\" or \"Fire of Unknown Origin\". \"Imaginos\" is a heavy album and features a great remake of \"Astronomy\", the best song on the CD. But unless you are prepared to invest some time, deciphering the story, and songs you won't get much out of the album. I picked up \"Imaginos\" on CD after hearing \"Astronomy\" late at night (the best time to play the CD), and there was a narrative about the \"Imaginos\" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened. I heard this only two times on the radio, and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan, and enjoyed some of BOC's earlier albums. Needless to say, the Stephen King narrative is not on the album. I was disappointed, but played the disk a few times. I enjoyed \"I Am The One You Warned Me Of\", a pretty straight ahead rocker, and \"In The Presence of Another World\" which is a more down-tempo song. Actually most of the songs are good, and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening. The only track that I found lacking, was the title track \"Imaginos\". For some reason, most likely the background singers: \"Oooohhhh Imaginos, Ooooohhh Imaginos, Oooooohhhh, ooooohhh, ooohhhh Imaginos\" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something. Once I got that image stuck in my head, I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves.

I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be true but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).\n\nBut maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does \"keep on going\", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.\n\nWhen she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like \"Real Love\", \"Reminisce\" and \"Love No Limit\", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet \"Be Happy\" and the poignant \"I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Life</a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" with Jay-Z (1996) and \"I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need To Get By\" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title \"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\" was absolutely well deserved.\n\nBut every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time \"The Breakthrough\" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.\n\nAs soon as I saw the video to her single \"Just Fine\", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.\n\nThe female empowerment of \"Grown Woman\" and \"Feel Like A Woman\" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.\n\nPharrell's multi-tempoed \"'Til The Morning\" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding \"Smoke\" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn \"Fade Away\". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMaybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.\n\nMaybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.\n\nThe album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is. Let the hissing, booing and clicking on the \"no\" button begin.", "label": 2}

I think they sing the chorus \"Skyyyyyyyy Pilot\" line a hundred times and there is a really obnoxious musical interlude.  I can understand why it is not often played on the radio.  There are plenty of good 60's songs to spend your 99 cents on so don't waste it on this one.", "label": 0}

JP fails to achieve this here.\n\nIn summary: JP is awesome but fallible, he's only human after all.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Okay, okay.  This 2-on-1 CD reissue of the two soundracks the Spoonful did should not be judged by the same criteria as their official studio releases.  That said, there are some classic Spoonful tunes here to be  weeded out from among the mostly instrumental songs found here.\nAbout a  third of the tracks are vocals and all deserve a listen.  \"Pow\"  is the kind of zany track like \"Blues in the Bottle\" or  \"Bald-Headed Lena\" that wound up on  the albums Do You Believe in  Magic and Daydream respectively.  \"Fishin' Blues\" remained in  John Sebastian's live set throughout his solo years.  \"Respoken\"  gives Zal Yanovsky the opportunity to provide some understated guitar  licks.  \"You're a Big Boy Now\" is classic Spoonful with its  bouncy rhythms.  And \"Darling Be Home Soon\" even became a hit  (peaking at #15).  However, \"Wash Her Away (from the  Discotheque),\" with its cheesy organ sounds like some studio mogul's  idea of what rock and roll should sound like.  And \"Girl, Beautiful  Girl/Barabara's Theme\" is little more than a throwaway when compared  to classics like \"Do You Believe in Magic\" and \"Summer in  the City.\"\nIn between, there are lots of incidental instrumentals.  All of it listenable(at least once), but not much really memorable.  Zally's guitar playing is always tasteful and Sebastian's harmonica is used  to good effect. Although on the tracks that get the full orchestration  teatment, like on \"Letter to Barbara\" and \"Miss Thing's  Thang,\" the band seems to disappear entirely.  And even as kitsch  \"Dixieland Big Boy\" can be painful to listen to.\nHowever, when  the band is left unadorned like on the bluesy \"A Cool Million\"  and the country-ish \"Phil's Love Theme,\" the Spoonful  deliver.\nOverall, this album is for completists only.  But with so little  of the Spoonful's original albums in print, this is worth giving a  spin--and the price isn't bad either.  CAUTIOUSLY RECOMMENDED", "label": 2}

Struggle\n\nI am giving \"Colours\" three stars and this may be one star too many. I simply have never really been able\nto enjoy this cd. I believe this is one of the GOOFIEST cd/tapes/lps that I have ever owned. I listed 3 musical\nformats for I have not been able to really LIKE this record on cassette, vinyl lp or even now on cd. The music is\nsimply rather poor at times. The band took a radical DEPARTURE from a form of what was at times psychedelic hard rock to a sort of new wave/punk rock. It must be noted also that the Resurrection Band was starting ANEW with a NEW record label. The band left Star Song Records and began a new contract with Light Records. I don't know why changing labels began a new sound for the band, but alas, the band sounded very little like the band that produced \"Awaiting Your Reply\" and \"Rainbow's End.\"\n\n\"Colours\" is a fairly bizarre and weak record I believe for the following reasons. First, the band seemed to try to\nmake a type of music that they did not quite have the mastery to make.\n\n1. Autograph---- this song starts off with a long guitar jam. The first notes of the jam are very unmusical but the jamming becomes enjoyable later. Wendi doesn't sing until 2:01 in the song. I think Wendi did quite well in her opening wail but it seems that even Wendi cannot sing the words quite fast enough. The message of the song is very strong. If anything this song is memorable for the contrast of the jam to the fast vocal. This is some sort of anthem. It's not bad, it's certainly different.\n\n2. Colours -- is what the band calls \"a little worship song\". The song is one the better songs on the record. This song again has a strong message. This song features Glenn Kaiser on vocals.\n\n3. N.Y.C.-- this is a fast paced song that again features Glenn Kaiser on vocals, but on this song Glenn shows us a part of his voice that we probably never needed to hear. Glenn sings in some sort of harsh sounding vocal, and it isn't the only song on the record where he uses this sort of vocal. Think of Barry Gibb going into a high voice, but this vocal sound by Glenn simply isn't flattering. Personally I find this vocal sound hard to listen to. The lyrics of the song are strongly pointing to Jesus Christ. I also like the strange drum sound that comes at the end of the song.\n\n4. Hidden Man-- is a Glenn Kaiser vocal sung in his natural voice. This is one of the better songs on the record, like Colours but better. Hidden Man is about Satan or about our man's LOST nature. This song is quite good. This is a basic rock song.\n\n5. Amazing --- This is yet another sort of NEW WAVE song. The song start off with some GOOFY guitar riffs that bounce around. The song is very fast and then Wendi comes on and sings. The song is about how AMAZING Christ is. Glenn joins in to sing a little also, but this is basically a Wendi Kaiser vocal. The song isn't exactly bad but the problem is that the song sounds goofy, amatueristic and not really ready for the radio. The song sound more experimental than anything. There really isn't anything wrong with this but it doesn't really make for the best music.\n\n6. American Dream--- tackles issues of our time. This is a vocal by Glenn and again in a sort of harsh vocal. This song features the sound of an exploding ATOMIC BOMB. The problem with the explosion is that it should be MUCH LOUDER. I have trouble following this song because Glenn covers so much vocally and because of the harsh vocal sound.\n\n7. Benny and Sue--- This song features Wendi on vocals. Wendi sings about a girl named Sue who has had an abortion. She meets up with Benny who is a drifting ex-marine. Sue was an ex-cheerleader. Benny and Sue get in a motorcycle crash. Benny dies not having accepted Christ. Sue didn't die in the crash but lives on to have a chance to accept Christ.\n\n8. City Streets-- A Glenn Kaiser vocal in the harsh vocal that I'm not crazy about. This is an urban sort of record about life on the streets, in the big city, about trying to make it in America. This song has a lot of realism going for it. This record features Rez using a new sound to reach people for Christ. The band was trying to stay\ncontemporary. The first two albums are more traditionally rooted in hard rock. This song has a very strong Christian Message.\n\n9. Beggar In The Alleyway--- This is a touching song as sung by Wendi Kaiser. It is a ballad of sorts. Colours would have been a much stronger record with more songs like this one. This song belongs on any Rez Anthology. Again, this song fits in with the urban/city theme that the band was going for. Remember, the members of the Resurrection Band lived in Chicago, in a poor section of town.\n\n10. The Struggle--- A Glenn Kaiser vocal, sung in his regular voice, this is very telling and personal song that I sometimes find upsetting and disturbing as it really hits home.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this record is that it doesn't flow at all. Perhaps this record is much better than I give it credit for. One thing about this record is that it has remained in my mind now for at least 25 years. Part of the reason is some bad music, and the other part is the sincere message and effort on the part of the band. The band uses the good, the bad, and the ugly, to reach people for Jesus Christ.\n\nMusically I gave this record a 3 out of five stars.\n\nLyrically, I think this record probably deserves 4 stars for it's attempt to reach people for Christ,\nand to put itself in the context of urban America. This is to say that the record is probably much more\nintelligent than it at first appears. What might be lost in some goofy songs is the band's attempt to reach\nfans with a different rock and roll format.\n\nWhat type of music is this?\n\nPunk?\n\nNew Wave?\n\nRock and Roll?\n\nAll of the above?\n\nThis is why I LOVE the Glenn Kaiser Band. GKB is SOLID BLUES ROCK with some country as well.\n\nIt sometimes seems that many songs were simply written to cater to Wendi, to giver her something\nto sing. I think the influence of a woman in the band often led to many bad decisions. When Glenn\nis in charge of the musical direction I haven't encountered goofy or embarrassing songs.\n\nBut give Glenn all the credit for being a FAMILY MAN, for LOVING his WIFE and for staying with her\nall of these years. Rez was a FAMILY, and the music was what it was. And Wendi brought a lot of balance\ninto the band. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.", "label": 2}

Elvis is just as romantic with God as he is singing to a lady. \"In the Ghetto\" was very thought-proviking and sad!

There's a history of the \"Negro Spiritual\" genre in songs like \"I'm Gonna Walk Dem Golden Stairs\" that I personally wouldn't have if it wasn't for this album, and that reminds us that maybe we are  getting \"more spiritually mature\" these days!", "label": 1}

This is certainly all the Jackson you need if you're not a devoted fan of his. Seems to me \"Butterflies\" would have been a more obvious choice than \"Dangerous\", but I'm guessing that they wanted the title track of that album to be represented here, as was \"Off The Wall\", \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\".

{"text": "I know I'm going to take heat for this.  I'm a Lucinda Williams fan going back to Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and I've purchased everything she's recorded. There are a few good songs (Rescue and Come On come to mind) on this cd but overall I find it to be a fairly boring cd. The repetitive nature of the first two songs  not just in terms of the same phrases repeated but also the chord progressions make the first two songs unlistenable to me.  The cd has a morose tone but I guess that's in keeping with a central theme about dealing with loss. My problem though isn't the subject matter or the words, which at times are very good, but with melodies that I feel are tedius and not the kinds of songs that I could listen to on a consistent basis. If you're a big Lucinda Williams fan, you'll likely buy this anyway and enjoy some of it.  If you're new to Lucinda, I'd suggest starting with the self title cd from 1988, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road or Sweet Old World. Then work your way up to the newer works like Essence, World Without Tears and this CD.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The point of this review is to complain to Amazon about the one click purchase buttons on the *right side* of the browser.  I was aiming for the album image and accidentally hit the purchase button.  Amazon, Please keep the purchase buttons on the top left corner.  Normal people do not buy an album based on its cover.\n\nSince I now *own* this album and can't return it,  I'll go ahead and right a review.  I apologize in advance to the Daft Punk band who I am sure are nice people.\n\nOverall this album consists of repetitive electronics spiced with drunk audience screaming their heads off.  It probable should be experienced after a couple of six packs.\n\nTrack 1 Interesting sounds in the beginning.  The overload synth sound makes an appearance here.  However there are long stretches where it sounds like they left the synthesizer on replay while they grabbed a beer.\n\nTrack 2 Sounds interesting but is fatally marred by a repeated swear word.  I don't see an explicit label on the album so this looks like an oversite by Amazon.\n\nTrack 3 Looks like mindless repetition is a trademark.  First half is booorrring.  Second half ends with a flourish.\n\nTrack 4 Occasional cool sounds suffocated by endless repetition.\n\nTrack 5 Nothing special. They do sing a few words.\n\nTrack 6 My 6 year old calls this song \"weird\".  The second half sounds like a needle stuck on a turntable.  Of course the live audience is too young to remember turntables so perhaps this is attractive.  All I can say is \"please end!!!\".\n\nTrack 7 This sounds like an actual song.  However the tune sounds like someone wiping spilled beer  off the keyboard while it is plugged in.\n\nTrack 8 is the best song so far.  The keyboard work is impressive even though the tune sounds like a disco song.  Unfortunately the band does not know when to quit and the song quickly degrades into repetition again.\n\nTrack 9 has a good start.  It sounds like Peter Frampton doing disco. Unfortunately it disintegrates into a cacophony of malfunctioning electronics.  The title Brainwasher is appropriate.\n\nTrack 10 is not worth your time.  I listened so you won't have to.\n\nTrack 11 is a truly annoying song.  Perhaps it sounds better when played backwards.\n\nTrack 12 spends about one minute repeating the one more time song.  The remaining 9 minutes are spent dancing around one note to the point that you need to take a medication to stop the ringing inside your head.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.\n\n\"I Want You Back\" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! \"ABC\" is very catchy. \"Got To Be There\" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings \"Got To Be There\" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! \"Rockin' Robin\" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?\n\n\"Ben\" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes \"Ben\" even more beautiful. \"Enjoy Yourself\" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. \"Blame It on the Boogie\" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in \"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground).\" Listen also for Michael to deliver \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings \"Rock with You;\" \"Off The Wall\" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled \"The Girl Is Mine.\" \"Billie Jean\" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! \"Beat It\" is yet another jewel on the first CD. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like \"Thriller;\" \"Thriller\" is timeless and just one listen proves it!\n\n\"Bad\" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is pop music at its very best. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on \"Another Part of Me.\" I love it! \"Black or White\" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. \"Heal The World\" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.\n\n\"Remember The Time\" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. \"Will You Be There\" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and \"Dangerous\" has some beat! \"You Are Not Alone\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing \"You Rock My World.\" Awesome!\n\nMichael Jackson fans should consider this a \"must-have\" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.", "label": 1}

However, these great beats don't sheild you from the fact that overall 50 isn't that great a rapper. Don't get me wrong, i'm a massive hip-hop fan. but, for me a great hip-hop album needs quality beats but also a clever lyricicstwho can flow, rhyme and deliver. Unfortunetly, i don't feel that this is 50. When it comes to the club and commercial tracks, 50 can write a catchy chorus, no doubt about that. But, you just don't believe what he is saying in the more darker, emotional tracks. There's no real feeling behind his delivery. In my opinion, the albm was not sold on 50's ability to rap but purely on his image. Hip-hop fans wanted someone with 50's image and they got that leaving other fans a bit cheated out of what was promised to be \"the future of hip-hop\".

{"text": "In 1981, Elton was coming off a 3 year period of releasing bland, rather unimaginative music.  The previous year's \"21 at 33\" showed a couple of signs of resurgence, but generally stalled.  \"The Fox\" signified Elton's overall strongest work since the double-lp \"Blue Moves\" in '76.  He was still collaborating with a mish-mash of song writers here, including Bernie Taupin who contributed to the strongest songs.  For some reason, I find \"The Fox\" to be one of Elton's most intriguing releases, if far from his overall best.  It shows a kind of transition from the awkward writing of \"21 at 33\" to the assured pop smarts of \"Jump Up!\"  Some of my personal faves would be \"Fascist Faces\" with it's forceful beat and turned up guitar solos and includes a full backing choir featuring Rev. James Cleveland, the gorgeous instrumental \"Carla/Etude/Fanfare,\" and the trademark Eltonian ballad \"Chloe.\"  Still, not everything works on \"The Fox,\" including the empty yet fun sounding \"Nobody Wins\" (not written by Elton) and the rather clunky title track.

When Andre says \"Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance,\" he meant the people responsible for this CD. Getting rid of the word \"come\" does not give the track merit as kids' music, any more than bragging about being \"Ice Cold\" is appropriate just because it comes out of a kid's mouth.\nI'm not going to go into the taste issue, that seems obvious to me, and it's been pretty well stated in other reviews.

The songs are passable, with a couple of standouts.  Two things are becoming evident by now: (1) Williams needs a strong production team to edit her work and get musicians to play who can play (e.g. the sublime Val McCallum on the return to form \"Blessed\").  I know a lot of non-musicians think this material -- along with \"World without Tears\" and \"Honeybee\" -- is elemental and thus more honest or true, but I don't agree.  Take a listen to the work up to \"Car Wheels\" or to \"Blessed\" and then compare.", "label": 2}

{"text": "A Single Man was the last Elton John album I bought as a matter of course; though the previous album, Blue Moves, had a few head-shakingly dull moments (such as \"Where's the shoorah?\"), it was good enough overall to keep me interested. But, for me, A Single Man represented the end of the line.\nMusically, the album was never all that bad. The music and performances often harkened back to the gospel-inflected sounds of the first three or four albums, Tumbleweed Connection in particular. (Even Paul Buckmaster was back!) The soulfulness of those early years had been in danger of being polished away until Blue Moves, and was back in full force here.\nWhat ultimately made this album so disastrously uneven were Gary Osborne's lyrics. After the high standard set by long-time lyricist Bernie Taupin, Osborne's lyrics were simplistic, banal, and cliched in comparison, rendering \"Return to paradise\", \"Big dipper\", and \"Shooting star\" more or less unlistenable. Even the album's lone U.S. chart success, \"Part-time love\", hasn't aged well, lyrically. It's a testament to Elton John's talent that any of the album works at all.\nThe highlights of the album, then and now, are \"It ain't gonna be easy\", \"Madness\", and the album-closing \"Reverie/Song for Guy\" (probably one of the first recordings by a major artist to use a rhythm box in place of a drum track), with \"I don't care\", \"Part-time love\", and \"Shine on through\" (which comes across slightly better now than then) not far behind.\nThe best things about this reissue are the vastly improved sound quality (though even the earliest CD versions of Elton John albums graphically revealed how poor the pressing quality of the original MCA LPs was) - thanks to the involvement of Elton's long-time producer, Gus Dudgeon - and the inclusion of the 1977 non-album single \"Ego\" (along with its flip side, \"Flinstone boy\"). The only real complaint I would have about this edition is that it lacks bona-fide credits for the extra tracks.\nNow then, where's that remastered Thom Bell Sessions?", "label": 2}

It's not terrible, but Type O can do much, much better.  This album is a lot less layered than say, \"October Rust.\"  It's more straight forward and guitar driven, lacking the interesting keyboard work and atmosphere of the other albums.  Much of the record is fast paced, which was fine for \"Slow, Deep, and Hard\" because that album was fast paced while being extremely emotionally intense.  This album is fast paced in a sort of light and airy way, which was fine for three tracks on \"Life Is Killing Me\", but is overused here.  The vocals aren't as good as on the other albums either.  Pete Steele hardly uses his trademark deeps and when he does they sound kind of flat and monotonous.  There's also some girl singing on one song and her voice isn't bad, but it's not exactly impressive.  I was also disappointed that this album doesn't have a cover song.

Honestly, the album has some hot tracks, no doubt, but basically that's because of the beats.  50's lyrics are pretty simplistic that stick to the same subject matter as 90 percent of the other rappers he's competing with for your $$$.\n  This is not a classic album by any stretch of the means.  Look, I know that rap still hadn't reached it's pinnacle for commercial exposure back in the mid to late 90's when 50 made the clever \"How to Rob,\" but that song, which was much better than any song on this album (yeah. . .I said it) didn't gain hardly any exposure (except the attention of some of the people he offended).\n  What do we learn from this boys and girls?  With the right marketing and a renewed emphasis on explicit violence ANYONE can become a household name over night.  Just ask 50 who destroyed Billboard records one week at a time.\n  I give the album 4.5 stars on the beats and production, but 1.5 stars on subject matter (or lack there of).

However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.\nThe first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.\nAfter this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.\nDear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.

The low price tag didn't do too much to reverse my opinion either. I went in not too familiar with the band. I heard their single Fat Lip and thought it was a good, catchy song. The video for it was great too. At any rate I got the cd and heres my take on it.  To start with I think the lyrics are good. They go well with the music and such. I like the mix of topics. Sum 41 doesn't try to be The Ataris and do the bitchin' about girls in every song nor do they try to be Blink 182 with stupid potty humor. Again, good mix of topics. Fat lip is your basic punk rock theme song. Rebelling against anyone who ain't down with us. It's a good song. Shows the bands intentions. I don't hold Fat Lip in the highest regards on the cd. That goes to Handle This. Good lyrics and great use of vocals and guitar.\n  Theres something about the way the cd sounds that is just awesome. The guitars come thru all nice and crunchy. The bassist is pretty damn good. The drummer is decent. I like on the vocals how everyone gets involved. This is a trend I like. Breaks up the monotony. Pain For Pleasure is a great sounding song, even if it is a joke song. Fat Lip is great to listen too. It builds up the intensity till an almost orgasm-like effect on the last chorus with the guitars. These canadians let their guitars hang out and it's for the best\n  Good cd. Nothing that will win any awards. It's fresh and isn't as nice to the general public than Blink 182. I doubt any 14 year old girls are going to be wetting themselves to get to this band.

Sure, there are overtones that strain credulity (the implication is that Rand needed the affair with Branden in order to finish Atlas Shrugged, and because of that, this is as much a film about the writing of that book as it is anything else), but there's no demonizing of either Rand or Branden. That, more than anything, is what saves this movie. It helps that the plot's interesting and the actors are well-suited to it (Delpy and Stoltz, especially, are always a fine pairing), but it is the treatment of the material that separates this from the pack. A very good movie. *** ", "label": 2}

{"text": "Having heard the Kirov Orchestra play Rimsky-Korsakov's Sheherazade several times live, during performances of the famous ballet version by Mikhail Fokine, I was quite surprised when I first listened to this CD. True, on most of these occasions the orchestra wasn't conducted by Valery Gergiev and although there is no doubt that the Kirov musicians have this music very much in their blood, this new recording won't go down as their greatest achievement.\nWith his unleashed, unpredictable tempi and heavy, unsubtle accents, and not helped by too much artificial reverberation, Valery Gergiev, whom we have heard more inspired than here, opts for an extremely rough, no-nonsense re-telling of Rimsky's ever-popular score. He seems to deny his Sheherazade every ounce of charm, poetry and sensuality, portraying a woman more likely to have spent some time in a brutal Chechnian camp than one who wallowed in the refined colours and perfumes of the Bagdad fantasized by Rimsky-Korsakov. Moreover, Gergiev doesn't avoid the pitfall of highlighting too many details of the orchestration - and true, at times he reveals unheard passages, as in the third movement - at the cost of losing grip of the overall structure. The frenzied tempo in which he attacks the last movement not only puts his orchestra in trouble, it also makes him miss the big final climax.\nThe orchestra's solos, the first violin from concert master Sergei Levitin to begin with, are undoubtedly commendable, but in this recording they definitely do not sound as the most sophisticated around. As is obvious from older recordings, the Kirov woodwinds surely have a lot more in store.\nThe short fillings from Borodin and Balakirev are much in the same vein.\nIn short, a modern-styled Sheherazade and it all depends of how you want your harem favourite to appear, but other conductors (among others Kirill Kondrashin, still unequalled for the dramatic sweep, Fritz Reiner for the sophistication of the orchestration) have given more complete and fascinating images of this wonderful work.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm a very big James Newton Howard fan!\n\nHis subtly and approach to his music is very haunting and beautiful while at the same time full of whimsy and flare. Every now and then a Director/Composer team find each other and everything works. hand in glove combinations like Speilberg & Williams, Burton & Elfman.... Shyamalan & Howard.\n\nMy favorite score is the Village (a Howard composed, Shymalan directed masterpiece!)\n\nMany have compared the Lady in the Water score to the Village.\n\nPersonally I like \"Lady\", but I don't love it. As a fan I feel Howard can do no wrong... but Lady simply isn't the best. I felt that the score worked very well for the movie, but falls short standing alone. The score itself is 42 minutes long and is followed by four Bob Dylan remakes. I wasn't impressed with any of them and would rather have had the extra 17 minutes replaced with more of Howard's score.\n\nBottom line: Lady in the Water is a good score, but certainly not the best work James Newton Howard has ever done. The end result leaves you wanting more. I felt that even after 42 minutes I kept hoping and expecting something of an emotional bang that never comes to fruition. I give the over all score 3 stars. The hightlights of the score are \"prologue\", \"the Healing\", \"Great Eatlon\" and \"End Titles\".", "label": 2}
{"text": "I'm reading these negative reviews and all of them are so disrespectful. IT'S CALLED ENTERTAINMENT PEOPLE!!!!!!! There is no need to make cruel jokes about dying or whatever. I read ignorant people's reviews saying \"Please shoot him again\" or \"This is garbage, rap is garbage, Metal rules!\" or \"Pop sucks, 50 Cent sux!\". Now, I must say the following three things if you\"re gonna review this album or any other:\n1. If you don't like Rap Music AT ALL, THEN DON'T REVIEW ANY RAP CDS(if you like Rock Music, Country or whatever THEN REVIEW THOSE ALBUMS OR DVDS)\n2. It seems like people have forgotten what POP MUSIC is, its short for POP-pular Music. If you don't like whats POPULARE then don't go complaining about it.\n3. If you\"re any kind of Rap Fan and don't like this album, HAVE A GOOD EXPLONATION ON WHY YOU DON'T LIKE THIS( not because he's been hyped or he should be shot up again).\nNow that I've got that off my chest, I shall review this album. I must say I believed the hype of 50 Cent. I have witnessed rapper been hyped an have made it to greatness. The most popular of them all has been Snoop Dogg. He started off as Dr. Dre's(who was already established at the time) new guy. He put him all over his album and gave him a guest spot on the 'Deep Cover' soundtrack. There was also a small preview inside The Chronic album package. Soon, Snoop's debut LP, \"Doggystyle\" went on as the fastest selling Rap LP of all time, also topping Pearl Jams classic, \"VS\".\nSo I wasn't worried about 50 Cent, he was hyped in the same way. He was backed up by not only Dr. Dre, a guy who brought us Ice Cube, Easy-E(R.I.P.),The D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Eminem but also Eminem a guy who already established himself as one of the all-tioe greats. Not to mention, I had heard about him before from Jam Master Jay(R.I.P.) another legend in the Rap Game.\nAs for the album, I think it's great. But I don't think it's a classic like \"Rasing Hell\", \"Staight Outta Compton\", \"Amaricaz Most Wanted\", \"The Chronic\", \"Doggystyle\", \"Illmatic\",\"All Eyez On Me\", \"Life After Death\" or \"The Blueprint\"(WHEW!), but I think it's tight. I do believe that 50 may be able to bring us a classic LP where he gives his all, not worrying about whether or not the teenage kids, gangstas, Radio DJ's, or Mtv or BET will appeal to it, but whether or not TRUE Hip-Hop fans and critics will respect it. He can talk about death, money, power, respect, bling, philosophy(since he tries to be like 2Pac most of the time) etc. If 50 wants to be loved the same way 2Pac was, then that's what he should do next time around, talking over and over about being a P.I.M.P. or teaching us how to stunt or being in da club isn't gonna get him at 2Pac or Biggie status.\nOverall, pretty tight album. Lived up to the hype but he's far from his actual potential to be a great lyricist. I really hope 50 sheds a brighter light on his next album and not worry about his Pop status and just give us Curtis Jackson, the same way 2Pac gave us Tupac Shakur on Me Against The World or become powerful like on The 7 Day Theroy. This 26 yeatr old still has potential to be a legend, hope he shows all his critics.", "label": 2}

{"text": "50 Cent is a lot of things - a skilled rapper, an intelligent businessman, a gangster (can't believe I just said that), a misogynist, a sex symbol, a modern-day Pop-Rap icon, an excellent hook writer and a reasonably okay hook \"singer\" (and, if \"High All The Time\" is anything to go by, a crack-head) - but one thing he definitely isn't is a insightful lyricist. He's just another typical Pop-rapper who wastes his mic skills on materialism, clubbin', sex, misogyny and violence, and his debut album, \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\", is solid proof.\n\nJudging by the album's narrow lyrical scope, the star-studded line-up of producers (Dr. Dre, Eminem, Denaun Porter, etc.), the naked album cover art (obviously, it's to attract groupies instead of deep thinkers), the minimal guest list (Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Eminem, Lloyd Banks & Nate Dogg), the unsurprisingly solid, hard-hitting production, the abundance of undeniable hooks and the publicity-attracting diss track (\"Wanksta\"), this album is clearly built for multi-platinum mass appeal instead of \"Illmatic\"-styled artistry. This is a shame, because the fact is that 50 Cent is a very good rapper with a strong, aggressive delivery. What 50 Cent seems to lack is artistic motivation (hell, it's called \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" - can the materialistic intentions be any more obvious?).\n\nThankfully, there are a few gems to be found on this album. \"Patiently Waiting\" is full of clever lyrical wordplay and complexity, even if the subject matter isn't too deep, and with Eminem dropping a nice 16 bars and thumping horn / violin / bass production, the song definitely hits hard. One track that's even better is the stellar \"21 Questions\", where 50 Cent shows vulnerability without being too sappy over Midi Mafia's minimalist, guitar loop-driven production. Meanwhile, Nate Doog adds the icing on the cake with a pleasing hook. And as materialistic and misogynistic as \"In Da Club\" is, there's no denying it's catchiness and I can't fully criticise the song because I sung along to it when I was younger (which re-confirms 50 Cent as a Pop-rapper). Other than that, it's the same ol' typical Hip-Hop that's been regurgitated across radio airwaves, TV stations and the overall media for the past few 10 or so years.\n\nAs bad as I consider this album to be, sometimes I feel sympathetic for 50 Cent and this album. Considering the life he's lead prior to this album (been shot 9 times, amongst other things, has gotta suck), the violence, misogyny and materialism that pollutes this album seems understandable. Then again, Nas, Rakim and a host of other dope rappers have turned tragedy into artistic triumph, so I don't see why 50 Cent can't (or won't...believe it or not, he's not as stupid as he looks or sounds). Nonetheless, \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" fails to register as a quality album to me. 1.5 stars!\n\nBest Tracks:\n\n\"21 Questions\" (feat. Nate Dogg)\n\n\"Patiently Waiting\" (feat.

However, there are a few very good tunes here that can't be found  anywhere else.  \"Something to Do,\" the sultry \"Lie to  Me,\" and the confident sounding, catchy \"If You Want\" are  especially good.

{"text": "A great collection of sixteen songs from one of the legends of contemporary Christian music. It roughly spans his very early music (thus the title), which was a curious mix of \"Jesus\" music and a touch of Elvis Presley, to the pop sound of the late 70's and early 80's. Wielding his tremendous baritone voice like a broadsword, Dallas Holm captured the essence of what young people and others wanted in their music during that fluid period in Christian music history.\nThe later songs range from ballads like I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF HIS CARE and A BROKEN HEART, which seem to come straight out of his own heart, to the somewhat playful and rocky JESUS IS A RIVER OF LOVE, and on to the intensity of I SAW THE LORD and the soaring anthem and signature song RISE AGAIN.\nPick this one up.

{"text": "If I didn't know any more about music than I do, I would be scratching my head over the fact that reviews of this recording seem to either claim it's excellent and should be at the top of anybody's list, or it's not even worth the plastic the CD is made of.  So why don't we just step back a moment and talk about some objective facts about this performance?  Maybe then we can arrive at a little bit more clear-headed conclusion regarding this recording.\n\nFirst, I am a professional clarinet player and have performed Scheherazade more than once.  So I know this piece inside out (literally) from the center of the orchestra.  I can assure you this is a very difficult piece for any orchestra to perform.  So the fact that the Kirov orchestra does as well as they do, especially considering the lightning speeds that Gergiev adopts, is very impressive.  There are a FEW moments here and there however, especially in the fourth movement, when their execution suffers because of those same lightning speeds.  Double and triple articulation passages that should be in the forefront of the overall sound picture sometimes wind up being muddied, plus there's an occasional moment of less than precise ensemble.  For the most part, however, their performance, if not world class, is very servicable.\n\nGergiev also presents a very \"involved\" interpretation.  In other words, he involves himself quite a bit in what you are hearing.  Whether or not that's a good or a bad thing just depends on how \"hands-on\" you like your recordings.  He works very hard to spotlight every detail that he thinks is important so that the less-informed (in his mind) listener is sure to not miss anything.  The question is whether or not anything important gets left in the dark by Gergiev's spotlight pointing elsewhere at a given moment.\n\nThe biggest problem with this recording, however, is the recorded sound.  It reminds me of something I would have expected to hear in a 50's or a 60's recording (and not a very good one at that).  There is a curious mixture of super-abundant ambience from the EXTREMELY resonant hall with close-up spotlit miking of individual players/sections.  So we're essentially at the mercy of the sound engineer to decide what we need to hear and what's OK to get lost in the very-long reverb from the venue.  Personally, I don't like somebody else making those decisions for me.  I want to hear it all.  It is possible to achieve that, especially with modern recording techniques/equipment.\n\nThis is all somewhat unpleasantly surprising, because I have Gergiev's Kirov Orchestra recording of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker as well, and felt that recording to be of exceptional quality, both in its performance as well as its sound.  Based on that, my hope was that this album would be a similarly successful discovery.  Sadly, it didn't quite measure up.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I would call this a decent, although not quite excellent performance, certainly not on the level of the world's greatest orchestras, that is marred by a very poor sound picture that prevents us from hearing the multitudinous details in Rimsky-Korsakov's miraculously detailed score.", "label": 2}

Picture this: you're at a Halloween party and you step on a novelty doormat and the tinny melody of \"Is There a Ghost?\" plays. You would immediately weep, the mascara running down your cheeks thus destroying your Lea Thompson costume. But step on that same mat and hear the gorgeous garage ruckus of \"Monster Mash\" and you beam with a smile. And you can bet your last dollar that mascara does the complete opposite of running down your cheek.\n\nThey say that ghosts haunt the land when they're searching for something. I worry that, when Mr. Bridewell passes, if he passes, his bearded, neck-tattooed spirit will roam the earth searching for a horror novelty classic he'll simply never find.", "label": 0}

But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with \"If We Are The Body\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her,\" but with \"What This World Needs,\" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!\n\nThis CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.

{"text": "Take my advice and do NOT buy this version of RTL. It may be halfspeed mastered and on 180 gram vinyl at 45 speed but that is no guarantee that it will sound good. The craze of vinyl has overwhelmed the companies that produce these records. First, the copy I got is warped. Couple that with the 45 speed and my tone arm jumps off one of the records. Only if I apply about 8 grams to it will it play, and I'm not doing that. But it's the quality of sound that just sucks. I see a lot of revues that say this album sounds great and either these people have really bad ears, really bad equipment that they think is good or worse yet, both. I have the original 'Megaforce\" pressing of this album and I promise you will never find a better sounding copy anywhere. Even the printing of the sleeve is far superior to any other pressing. These can still be had for very near the price of the halfspeed mastered or maybe a lttle more. If you want the original sound, seek out and buy a 'MINT\" or \"NM\" \"Megaforce\" pressing Ride the lightning. It will have the number \"MRI 769\" on the spine and on the back. This is how you can tell you have the original. Not only will you have the best recording in your hands, you will also own a piece of history in your hands, instead of a piece of crap. Even if you can't find one of these, find a original \"Electra\" copy and the quality will still be far better than all the rest.

{"text": "Kings of Convenience are two Norwegians named Erlend and Eirik, and \"Quiet is the New Loud\" is their first album. It is a group of recordings oddly reminiscent of any number of precedents - Simon & Garfunkel are the obvious reference, but so are Belle & Sebastien and Nick Drake - without ever actually sounding like anything else at all. Indeed, one of the strange effects of this nearly ephemeral folk-pop is its evasiveness. Instrumentation, for example, gets absorbed into the total effect; every time I hear \"Toxic Girl\" I'm surprised to discover it has drums. I remember it being just singing and guitar. In fact, each track has drums, electric guitar, sometimes on up to cellos and orchestration. The effects are hardly obvious.\nThis goes for the group itself: two Norwegians who sound like Englishmen, accompanying themselves on multi-tracked recordings done largely in Liverpool. Given its recording location, the whole album seems almost a deliberate reversal of The Beatles's \"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\" where Lennon and McCartney produced the whole band's sound by themselves. The album cover - a picture of Erlend and Eirik with a female friend (perhaps Daisy Simons who co-wrote one of the tracks) next to some fjord-side boathouse - even looks like a Beatles-era artifact reprised. (Norwegian Wood, anyone?). The Kings of Convenience seem intent on using the whole panoply of studio effects and instrumentation towards the end of making as quiet an album as possible. The title is not arbitrary, nor even merely descriptive; it is a manifesto. The sentiment isn't new of course; it's fundamental to mid-twentieth century avant-garde aesthetics. \"Less is more\" was Mises Van der Rohe's motto. But the real success of the Kings' sound is that it doesn't actually come across as minimalist. The negations are played out and undercut from within rather than through after-the-fact reductions.\nI have said nothing so far about the songs or the lyrics. No doubt, the argument that the album functions as a kind of auto-negation of assertion has to apply especially to the singing. More often it does just trail off behind the repetition of a guitar melody. Harmony vocals play in and out almost as cross-interference, as does instrumentation. Phil Spector may haunt this production, though I can't be sure it's intentional. All the same, the album comes with a lyric sheet, and the thematic is consistent: obsession with lost relationships, heartbreaks, and memories. Dusty Springfield once said she never paid any attention to the words in her songs. I'm not sure the words matter at all in these songs. Though I can only imagine that Erlend and Eirik's command of the English language is fluent, there is something about the construction of these songs, and their delivery, which suggests a kind of automatic delivery which seeks to produce a somatic effect rather than a semantic uptake. The lyric sheet functions almost as a kind of confirmation that our understanding of the overall mood is the correct one. The sense of locution seems to be that the best way to get someone's attention is to speak very quietly.\nI don't think I'd much care to listen to this formula repeated ad nauseum, but as a knowing intervention in the contemporary pop scene, I'm ready to go the extra mile to defend its end-of-the-summer melancholy against the brutalism and nihilism of what passes for youth culture today. Or rather, the idea that Kings of Convenience are the latest manifestation of post-punk European rock'n'roll works well enough for me, but I imagine in the age of Limp Bizkit the kids won't quite be clamoring to buy \"Quiet is the New Loud.\" That is their loss.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that \"Voice of Truth\" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.\n\nI really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.\n\nThe first song on the album: \"What This World Needs\" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.\n\nSong #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.\n\n#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.\n\n#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )\n\n#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.\n\n#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. \"The Altar and the Door\" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.\n\n#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my \"anthem\". I admire Mark's clever word play- \"Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is...\" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.\n\n#8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.\n\n#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.\n\n#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.\n\n#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.\n\nI highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.\n\nOne more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Alice Cooper-Zipper Catches Skin **1/2\n\nThe way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.\n\n'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.\n\nThe rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.\n\nWhile not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down.

{"text": "I hate Kidz Bop so much, it's not even funny. Parents may think that these CDs are good listening for their little five-year-olds, so that they can enjoy the music and be able to hear the lyrics more clearly, but, really, these Kidz Bop people are so stupid, they actually thought that the song \"Game of Love\" was about cooking. The songs are too inappropriate for kids to sing along too, including the content of the lyrics. Some of them are okay, like FeFe Dobson's \"Take Me Away\",\" or Hilary Duff's \"So Yesterday,\" but do you really think it's appropriate for a kid to be singing along to \"Low\" by Kelly Clarkson or No Doubt's \"It's My Life?\" Uh, no, because the lyrics to those songs are about stuff that kids aren't supposed to be hearing, let alone singing about! Don't even get me started on the quality of the songs. They are not the original versions; the original beats and tempos of these songs have been removed and replaced with a boring version. The singers couldn't sing for beans- plus, it's mostly adults singing the main verses, and the kids squeal along with the chorus. The singers, besides the music, is already enough to give you a headache just after one song. And even if little kids did enjoy the original songs from the original artists, why would they want the songs to be modified, too? We don't need these CDs, kids can just go out and buy something like Now That's What I Call Music or Totally Hits, for crying out loud!

{"text": "My friend, Tommy, had let me borrow this last Monday. I just now finished listening to the whole thing in one sitting, so I'll give you my impression of the album. Keep in mind that I'm not a metal fan. This is the first Metallica album that I've listened to in its entirety. I suppose that it would be considered great by a metal fan, but it's merely okay background music to me. It really didn't hold my attention much. It's a classic 1980s metal album, and a lot of Metallica fans agree that it's the band's best. Most of it is fast. Some of it is slow. The theme of this album is death in different forms (suicide, the killing of the first-born sons in Egypt, electrocution, drowning, etc.). It sounds a lot better to me than the [stuff] that I heard on the radio from 2000 to 2001 (when I worked as a night stocker at a supermarket and had to listen to the local metal station). The final track is an instrumental. I guess I like it. If Konami ever makes a CastleVania game set in the 1980s, they should use this track for one of the stages. My point is that, if you're not a metal fan, you won't like this album, but, if you are a metal fan, you probably will like this album.", "label": 2}

If only this instrumental lineup had been used elsewhere in the CD.\n\"High Noon\" is the only song here that could be called upbeat. It contains some powerful lyrics, but unfortunately, it is produced rather blandly, without any colorful instrumentation.\nFrom a lyrical standpoint, AP is as fresh and poetic as ever; but musically, this CD just doesn't measure up to his last two. Peterson was never a rocker, but he is even more mellow here than we've seen him in the past.

I went further back into their catalogue and got Predator's Portrait and Steelbath Suicide, and those albums blew me away. Complex riffing, ambient keyboards, crazy solos, and Bjorn's vocals were great.\n\nStabbing the Drama on the other hand basically spells the end of Soilwork as a Gothenburg band because this album is pure watered down Nu Metal garbage. It sounds like Dry Kill Logic with some synth in it.\n\nBjorn's voice has turned into an annoying tough guy growl, the riffs are so simple I can probably play most every song on this album and I've been a guitarist for only 4 months. No more mind blowing solos, harmonies and melodies, just the same muddy bar chord riffing in every goddamn song with what do you know a sing a long chorus to match.\n\nWhile every American band is evolving and adapting the complex style that Soilwork helped pioneer they are devolving and taking up a sound that sounds like the last days of the Nu Metal explosion.\n\nIf this isn't bad enough, the new music video for the single off Stabbing the Drama shows only Bjorn with a beanie on walking around a junkyard. Not one other band member is shown AT ALL. Not even for a frame. The whole point of metal is to display the musicmanship of the band members, not glorify the lead singer. The band may as well be called Strid.\n\nIf you're a fan of bands like Dry Kill Logic, Nothingface, Slipknot, Fear Factory, and the like you may like this. But for those who are looking for complex metal or the Soilwork of old stay the hell away from this crap pile.\n\nI'd recommend getting the new Dark Tranquillity over this.

{"text": "This review is specifically directed towards the edited version of the album.  Now I'm not gonna start on some rant about free speech, or censorship, or whatever.  That would just waste my time and yours, since you've already decided that you have an interest in this edited CD.\nSo here's the lowdown.  This clean version of \"The Slim Shady LP\" does a lot of things wrong.  The most obvious problem is the editing method used.  Instead of dubbing words out, which is the least one ought to expect, they simply scramble/reverse the audio.  Not just the vocals, either - the ENTIRE audio section gets altered.  Taking out words is one thing, but when the entire beat and instrumental track gets scrambled, it kills the flow of the song.  In \"Guity Conscience\" they also use this awful \"scratching\" effect on top of the audio - and I don't mean hip-hoppy turntable scratching, I mean a literal, unpleasant SCRATCHING noise that would make you think you had a defective CD or something.  At other points on the album, the production gets even lazier as portions of the songs are actually SILENCED.  As in no vocals, no backing instremental, no audio.  Nothing but a blank space.\nThe second problem comes with the language they choose to edit.  In most cases, edited versions are produced in order to remove curse words.  On this disc, it's only the \"F-word\" that gets taken out, so you'll still be hearing \"sh--\" quite a bit.  I'm not gonna get into a debate about appropriate language, but making an edited CD that you still wouldn't be able to play on radio seems rather pointless.\nMost annoying of all, however, is what DOES get edited on this CD.  Every drug reference gets scrambled, which is somewhat understandable, but still frustrating in many cases.  But then they go and remove \"violent\" lyrics, and this is where things get out of hand.  Words like \"die,\" \"kill,\" and \"shoot\" are all removed.  Case in point - in \"Brain Damage,\" there's a line about schoolyard bullies roughing up Eminem as a child.  Eminem quotes these bullies as saying \"You're gonna die!\" but the word \"die\" is scrambled.  Elsewhere on the disc, a narrator describes \"the legend of Slim Shady\" in a parody of Westerns, and relates the tale of how Slim was \"shot in the back.\"  The word \"shot\" is edited.  Half of these edits are things you can say in G-rated movies.  Taking out curse words is one thing, but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener.  It's especially silly in a song like \"Role Model,\" where the message of the entire song is how Eminem is NOT a role model, and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes.\nYou can see the irony here; \"sh-t\" is left in while \"shoot\" gets scrambled.  Only \"Just Don't Give\" has been resonably edited, and that's only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single.  This CD is un unlistenable mess; and even if you're willing to tolerate some \"choppiness\" in order to get a \"clean\" version, you'll be disappointed on that front as well.  If you're looking for a relatively clean Eminem CD, I'd recommend the edited version of \"The Eminem Show.\"  All the edits on THAT album are of professional quality, and they succeed in bringing all the language to a TV-PG level, while leaving most of Eminem's wit intact.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Sum 41 is one of those bands that if you hear them once, you never really care to hear them again.  Right now, the punk rock scene is getting overly-crowded with look-a-like, sound-a-like bands that offer nothing original or ground-breaking.  Sum 41 is most certainly one of these bands.  It seems like they rely entirely on the success of one song, and fill the rest of the album with garbage that they somehow call music.  On their first album \"Half Hour of Power\", that song was Makes No Difference.  While that song was halfway decent, the rest of the album was easily forgettable.  The same thing goes for \"All Killer, No Filler.\"  Unfortunately, this cd should have been named \"Mostly Filler, One Killer\".  The one song that I'm referring to is \"Fat Lip\", and it's been all over the radio and TRL lately and continues to pick up steam.  This song is average, and I can see how it became a hit, but it still does not deviate from the standard punk rock formula.  And what's up with their live act?  The choreographed guitar playing?

{"text": "I'm a huge Sarah fan - have been for 10 years (and I'm 20 years old!).  I first fell in love with 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy', and then I discovered 'Solace' and 'Touch' and valued them in their own ways - 'Solace' for its sometime baroque, stark sounds, and 'Touch' for the translucency of sound. 'Fumbling' is my favorite of Sarah's though - overall the sound of her 1993 release sounds fresh even for 2003 :)\nBeing such a fan of great expectations, it is painful to state that I was pretty disappointed when I listened to the CD for the first time. The songs after \"Train Wreck\" (track #5) seemed to fade into mediocrity and dullness. Her voice appeared overshadowed and less powerful and raw than on tracks such as \"Hold On\" and \"Possession\". I was one unhappy Sarah fan. :(\nHowever...\nWhen you play this CD a lot more and really listen to the last 5 tracks, they're actually not that bad. Here is a review all the tracks, in order of their appearance on the CD.\n\"Fallen\" - her voice is a bit held back and smoothed over, but I really like the strings, the melody is catchy, and there is an appropriate climax. It's a quite cheerful tune in many respects, in contrast to the lyrics which are cautionary and dark. I would like it a lot more if her voice sounded less smooth and processed.\n\"World On Fire\" - The melody and chorus stick in your mind more than the wishy-washy lyrics. I really enjoyed the melody, even more than in \"Fallen\". But once again, her voice is wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too smooth. I know her voice is naturally smooth but this is the sound of too much production! The piano bit near the middle section of the song is quite pretty, but the song itself is just really quite pretty...that's it. So it could be a plus or minus depending on your tastes (it's a minus for me).\n\"Stupid\" - I thought this song would really rock for a moment like \"Possession\". The chorus is like a breath of fresh air and a \"pow\" to the senses. The rhythm really pushes and pushes on, which is nice because songs in the later part of the album just kind of \"sit\" there. You'll see (hear!) what I mean...and AGAIN her voice is too smooth and almost fades into the background at some moments. If you don't agree, listen to her older CDs and you'll know what I mean. :)\n\"Drifting\" - kind of reminded me of \"Witness\" (in 'Surfacing') with the rhythm in the background. Except more cheerful and I like \"Witness\" better. This song is just sort of blah - there are nice moments but the song just kind of chugs along like a dying car at other times. Sometimes I thought the song would just stop in the middle of a beat...\n\"Train Wreck\" - cool opening. Reminiscent \"Black and White\" (in 'Surfacing') with the cool background beats and harmony. Sarah's voice is even more overprocessed here than in Fallen, but the melody is great. The lyrics aren't bad either, but I kind of are a bit too fragmented and have moments of pure cliche \"lose myself completely / in your sweet embrace / all my pain's erased\"...sounds like insipid pop music...hmm...\n\"Push\" is a bit too sappy but surprisingly here her voice is the saving grace - it is neither too sentimental nor boring. The lyrics kind of make me gag though, and it's not because I'm a cynic - it's because coupled with the sappy music it's a sugar overload. For some reason the tune is just too boring. Pass! I liked 'I Love You' (from 'Surfacing') a lot more.\n\"Answer\" - it's really, really slow. For fans of her piano-based songs like \"Angel\" and \"Do What You Have to Do\", you will probably be disappointed. The song has some nice moments (when she sings high it's haunting), but on the whole it's a song I could easy fall asleep to, especially when the chords are REALLY spaced out...a disappointment compared to \"Angel\".\n\"Time\" - reminded of the overall mood on 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' - contemplative and with a nice background rhythm that drives the song. It's kind of blah though, because her voice is too soft and breathy I think, it doesn't really stand out. Nothing is terribly wrong with this song, but it doesn't really get me either.\n\"Perfect Girl\" is breathy, catchy, propulsive, and haunting. I didn't really notice this song the first time around listening, but it's a subtle little gem. Lyrically it reminds me of \"Good Enough\" (from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy') but musically it reminds me a little bit of \"Full of Grace\" (from 'Surfacing'). Her voice is an asset in this song especially in the high notes. It's one of the better songs here because finally lyrically AND musically something appears to stick.\n\"Dirty Little Secret\" - also mainly piano, I liked it better than \"Answer\". It's a emotive song with touching moments that recall \"Angel\" but it's not as strong overall. The song slows down halfway through and loses momentum. Darn. Hearing it live (on MuchMoreMusic), it sounded much better though - more shape.\nIt's great music to play during a party I think, because of the melodic variety and ability at times to blend into the background (kind of like elevator music - not a compliment). It does have its moments and I suggest you probably don't listen to the lyrics cuz they aren't that great. Honestly. I prefer the lyrics to 'Fumbling' any day (especially \"Posession\", \"Fear\", and \"Good Enough\"). Musically it's tuneful enough to hum too, and her voice is nice albeit not shown off enough.

{"text": "Early in 2003, 50 cent realesed one of the most anticipated albums in the history of Hip-Hop \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\". I bumped this album for about 3 straight months before taking it out of the CD changer. Over the summer, marked with a new appreciation for rap,I listened to this album, only to be disapointed. Though the album has very good beats, 50's rhymes are not great, (though I do think he is getting better after hearing some recent guest appearences) the best verses on this album are owned by Eminem on \"Patiently Waiting\" and \"Don't Push Me\". Along with Eminem's guest appearences, the best songs on the album are \"In Da Club\" (one of the best hip-hop party jams ever, yea ever), and \"Heat\", which has a nice beat delievered by one of the best Dr. Dre. Lyrically overall this album is not great, but riding on it's beats, it earns a 3/3.5 rating. Hopefully 50's follow up will be better.", "label": 2}

They were overdubbed later, as his stack was way too loud to blend with the orchestra. Yngwie himself said this in an interview. I also was under the perception that the \"rock\" and \"classical\" CD's were different in packaging and sonics. In other words, different mixes. I didn't buy the \"rock\" mix, only the \"classical\". Yngwie performances were awesome, as expected and usual. The sound however, was very darky and muddy. As with all orchestral recordings done with distant mic techniques, it has an abundance of reverb, but this shouldn't make it muddy. I ran it through my BBE processor, with the controls at 10 o'clock, and it did wonders for it. This could have been easily fixed in the mastering. Oh well, that's why I gave it three stars, because of bogus sound quality. The songs done on classical guitar were the stars.", "label": 2}

{"text": "3.5 stars\n\nEisley's debut L.P. \"Room Noises\" is a perfectly good debut record. There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.\n\n\"Memories\", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song \"Telescopic Eyes\" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.\n\nFrom there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.\n\nBut I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. \"Room Noises\" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential.

{"text": "I will say it again.  No.  It seems as though all you need is an insurmountable amount of hype to sell records.  This is not music, this is a trend.  Obviously, no one has really listened to this and his extreme lack of lyrical ability.  Because that is the only contribution he made to the album.  He didn't produce anything.  Speaking of producing, the beats were weak too.  I don't even know what this is supposed to be.  How bad is the album?  I'll run through it.  First comes the intro.  Worthless.  Next is \"What Up Gangsta\".  Ok, now this is a strong track.  I figured there might be better ones after right?  Wrong.\nNext is \"Patiently Waiting\".  Yuck.  The beat is horrible, it sounds like something i could make by tapping on walls.  50 can't rhyme as usual.  Eminem is ok on it.  Many Men.  Many, many, many, many, many, many men.  How many many many times is he going to say many?  I guess that was his idea of comic relief because you would need it because of bad things to come later.  Next is the greatest song EVER, \"In the club\".  Mainly because it is so original and i've never heard about being in the club.  Seriously, I heard that song and it got me thinking,  What is this \"club\" that you speak of?  It is so original and therefore I cannot relate.  Just worthless.  Next is \"High all the time\".  Nobody cares about you being high all the time with your horrible lyrics.  Another cliche.  Next comes \"If I can't, Bloodhound and Back Down. ZZzzzZZZzzzZZZ.  Bloodhound was listenable at best, but nothing special.  \"Back down\" is a diss to ja rule.  Gee, now why would 50 go after ja rule?  Could it be that he is the only rapper that is worse than him? (in his mind)  Besides Ja murdered you on his song \"The Wrap\".  50 can't diss anyone.  Just go back to the hole you came from.  Ok P.I.M.P. is nice.  Nice laid back Jamaican style beat.  But the horrible lyrics ruin it.  \"Like My style\" and \"Poor Lil Rich\" are also listenable AT BEST.  But still not even worth a discussion.  21 Questions.  Just horrible.  I hear elementary school kids singing \"I love you like a fat kid love cake\".  Yeah it's a clever line if you are catering to 12 year olds.  The beat is HORRIBLE.  The worst I ever heard.  The hook by Nate Dogg is even worse.  Nate is still the king of hooks, don't get me wrong but seriously I don't even know what the hell he was trying to do on this track.  \"Don't Push Me\" and \"Gotta make it to heaven\" come next and there's nothing special there.  The bonus tracks were ok.  But like I keep saying, the only stuff worth listening to on this cd is OK at best.  75% of this is terrible.  No innovation.  No content.  You got shot 9 times.  Who cares?  That's all that this chump has going for him.  Here's a memo to all music fans.  This music [is bad].

{"text": "Say what you want about the countless re-issues, if you've never owned EC's Columbia years or maybe frittered them away, this is an instant library. Overall, it's three stars, but you're going to get some of our greatest living songwriter's classics in one fell swoop.\n\nIntroduced by \"My Aim Is True,\" Elvis set the standard for the new crop of songwriters. Shortly after Elvis Costello let this 13 song tornado touch down in the US, he made the infamous comment that his thorny songs about relationships were motivated by revenge and guilt. That established, rarely has this much misanthropic venting been so great a joy to listen to. It wasn't just that Elvis was angry, it was that he was throwing twisted phrases into the vocabulary with seeming effortlessness.\n\nThen he upped the ante by making The Attractions his backing band. If \"My Aim Is True\" landed on like a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit, \"This Year's Model\" was the explosion after, and \"Armed Forces\" was Elvis and The Attractions' claustrophobic pop masterpiece. Elvis' first album with the Attractions more than lived up to its predecessor, in that having a working band behind him matched the music to the blunt force of the songs. These are some of the songs by which EC is measured, like \"Radio Radio,\" \"Pump it Up\" and \"The Beat.\" \"Armed Forces\" was loaded with melody and paranoia, fueled by cramped touring vans, hotel rooms and long stretches of listening to ABBA, Kraftwerk, Bowie and the Beatles while driving between gigs. It was also the last Elvis album to mirror the \"angry young man\" singer-songwriter of new wave. \"Oliver's Army\" and \"Two Little Hitlers\" brimmed with neo-fascist imagery and highly charged sexual/emotional content, yet flourished with pop-hooks. \"Accidents Will Happen\" portrays a barely apologetic philanderer as he tries to explain the infidelities of his life, and uses one of early Elvis' frequent descriptions of romantic partners as a \"victim.\"\n\nBut it was an apologetic EC that was recording the follow-up. After incessant touring and the excesses of rock living, Elvis made headlines with a single regrettable drunken utterance. It forced him to a place that made him reevaluate his career to that point, and the 20 song \"Get Happy\" began to emerge. He immersed himself in a stack of his old favorite soul records (Booker T, Four Tops, Stax/Volt albums), and emerged a different songwriter. \"Get Happy\" was the album where EC challenged himself to move beyond a public's expectation and led to his forth five star record.\n\nAfter the \"Get Happy\" experiment, Elvis wanted to try something else new, heading for Nashville to meet with an iconic country producer, and then cut an album of some of his favorites. It really could have been a great record. Instead, \"Almost Blue\" was Elvis' first big misstep; the sound of a 9 to 5 producer (Billy Sherrill) trying to shoehorn them into a paint by numbers sound. While the album kicks off like it should (\"Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To?\"), the ensuing album finds the band in a straightjacket. The sole exceptions, naturally, were the ballads.\n\n\"Trust\" broke form with earlier Elvis Costello albums. For the first time, Elvis shifted focus from the brute force of his music to presenting himself more as a vocalist. A fair amount of this might have to do with his budding relationship with Chris Difford of Squeeze (who duets on \"From A Whisper To A Scream\"). Elvis was also in the middle of a writer's draught, which left a couple of songs sounding like filler (hence the 4 star rating). Not like it mattered; along with \"New Lace Sleeves\" and \"From A Whisper to a Scream,\" there was the stunning piano ballad, \"Shot With His Own Gun.\" That particular song upped the ante for Elvis the writer, as well as being perfectly realized as a vocalist. Like many of Elvis' albums, \"Trust\" has aged delightfully.\n\nWhen \"Imperial Bedroom\" first hit the shelves, critics were falling over themselves with superlatives. Even Columbia's \"Artist...Masterpiece?\" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since \"My Aim Is True?\" The answer was yes...and no.\n\nGeoff Emerick put his Beatle-esque touches for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered with till they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original LP's side one a song-suite of near \"Sgt. Pepper\" proportions, with the standout \"Man Out Of Time\" marking the bridge between Elvis old and Elvis new. Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were being tossed around when \"Imperial Bedroom\" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with \"serious music\" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. It was likely the best album of 1982.\n\nFlush with artistic raves and the critical success of \"Imperial Bedroom,\" Elvis Costello did exactly what we should have expected him to do. He made an album absolutely nothing like the one prior. \"Punch The Clock\" is a maniacally obsessive pop album, primarily due to producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. They wrapped EC and the Attractions with soul vocals, punchy horns and a free-swinging style of production that was the polar opposite of Nick Lowe's. (Imagine \"Get Happy\" with more breathing space in the songs.) This CD caught Elvis flirting with American Top 40 via \"Everyday I Write The Book.\" It also meant Elvis' definition of \"pop\" included heartfelt jabs at the then state of England. \"Pills and Soap\" and \"Shipbuilding\" were remarkable for their inclusion among the giddy \"The Greatest Thing\" or \"Mouth Almighty.\" The understated, elegant lyric, along with a perfect solo from Chet Baker made \"Shipbuilding\" not only the best song on \"Punch The Clock,\" but one of the outstanding songs in EC's library.\n\nGiven the success of PTC (one of EC's first to reach gold status), it made sense that L&W would be around for the next. If you want to gauge how underrated \"Punch The Clock\" usually is, give a re-listen to \"Goodbye Cruel World,\" the undisciplined follow-up. Even Elvis himself conceded the point on the Ryko reissue, with the infamous \"You've purchased our worst album\" comment. Time has given \"Goodbye Cruel World\" a finer burnish. The tug of war going on between Elvis himself, his band and producers Langer and Winstanley took some good songs and \"date stamped\" them. The songs aren't any less stellar; two of his strongest ever are here, the anthem \"Peace In Our Time\" and \"The Comedians.\" Along with \"Shipbuilding,\" \"Peace In Our Time\" joins the great political songs that EC has written, timely even now.\n\nWhen Elvis decided to finally to roots rock HIS way, he switched his name back to Declan MacManus and forged ahead into brilliance. With the exception of the slippery jam session of \"Eisenhower Blues,\" the 15 songs on \"King Of America\" are as flawless a whole album as anything from his early years and his most successful collaboration with a producer, in this case, T-Bone Burnett, save Burt Bacharach. Songs like \"Brilliant Mistake\" and \"American Without Tears\" effortlessly blossom with atmosphere and honesty. Even the Attractions, who at this venture, had become estranged and embittered, contribute one of their best performances ever with the single song \"Suit Of Lights.\" Elvis seemed to be at a more relaxed state of lyricism than since the underrated \"Trust.\" Compare the fire analogies of \"The Only Flame In Town\" (on \"Goodbye Cruel World\") to the far superior \"Indoor Fireworks\" here. Or such leap from the speakers couplets like \"She said that she was working for the ABC news, it was as much of the alphabet as she new how to use\" from \"Brilliant Mistake.\" There is also one of my all-time favorite Costello-isms, as he describes a relationship with a contrary girlfriend to be akin to \"a chainsaw running through a dictionary.\" Perhaps my favorite moment on \"King Of America\" would be the two person viewpoint of the disc's closer, \"Sleep Of The Just.\" A tale of an army pin-up girl and her soldier brother, it's a masterful tale of conflicting family and emotions, with a slow sad organ fade. \"King Of America\" showed the vitality of his early exploration of the genre. It remains one of the many five star albums in Elvis' Columbia years worthy of rediscovery.\n\nAfter the extremes of the three previous records, Elvis made what people would probably conceive of as a typical \"Elvis Costello and the Attractions\" album. Nick Lowe came back and threw subtlety to the wind for \"Blood And Chocolate,\" Elvis' angriest album since \"This Year's Model.\" Elvis himself described the inspiration for most of this material as \"Messing up my life so I could write stupid little songs about it.\" Wave after wave of vitriol backed by The Attractions' and Lowe's artful distorted sound matched the emotional content of many of the songs, and one of all time Elvis' brilliant performances is here. \"I Want You\" drags you into a hellish confrontation with more than a passing nod to John Lennon and The Beatles' song of the same name. Elvis vents with derisive passion till the sounds slowly drop away to little more than the sound of him deeply breathing the title over and over.\n\nPerhaps it's in the fact that the recording of \"Blood And Chocolate\" was done as quickly as possible with as few takes as necessary, but for the most part, this was Elvis most relentless CD since \"This Year's Model.\" As the final song in this chronology of the Columbia years, it marks a moment when Elvis came full circle.", "label": 2}

As far as debuts go Jayz's debut album \"Reasonable Doubt\" blows this out of the water, never mind the Biggie and Pac masterpieces!! Come to think of it the white kid from Detroit who produced and rhymes on a couple of the tracks (\"Patiently Waiting\" being one of the stronger tracks) comes much closer to being cut from the same cloth as a Big and Pac, but doesnt get recognized for it cause of the color of his skin. Just listen to how much tighter his flow is than 50's on the joints they do together. Anyway, thats a whole other debate in itself.

{"text": "I have heard John Michael Talbot in concert a few times over the past several years and enjoyed a wonderful worship experience.  Though his Catholicism has some clear distinctions from my own Protestant beliefs, I find that Talbot truly has the heart of a worshipper, which will connect with Christians of all stripes.\n\nFrom those experiences, I bought this album, hoping to hear similar songs.  Much to my surprise, most of the tracks on this double album are huge choral and orchestra pieces, rather than the accoustic solo work of his recent concert tours.  At first, I was disheartened.\n\nHowever, the album has really grown on me.  Though not at all what I was expecting, this is great music nonetheless.  The sound is somewhat dated, but the music is brilliantly written and wonderful performed.  This isn't appropriate as simple background music like some of his more recent work, but it's a great album in its own right and presents a good collection of some of his earlier work.  I highly recommend it.", "label": 1}

One of my teachers reccomended i check out this album becaues this guy called Cliff Burton is on it and that he was one of the more popular bass players.\n\nLet me just say that this guy is very overrated in the music circles. 'Ride The Lightning' would get about 3 stars b/c it is a decent metal album, but Cliff would get no stars at all, talk about one of the most hyped up bass players known to man. I'v heard better bassists in Nu Metal, and i utterly hate Nu Metal.\n\nLets get this strait right now, this drug-addict was no Steve Harris, Geddy Lee or Geezer Butler.\n\nI looked up the bass tabs for some of these songs and just laughed. I don't know how Burton was ever considered good at all, he has very simple bass lines much like Gene Simmons or Cliff Williams, but those two have about 10 times the talent that Burton had. I'm starting to think that it is all just hype behind what Cliff Burton was, or could actaully do. Just one more overrated notch under the belt of the machine known as Metallica. They use his death as an excuse as to why Metallica is no good anymore, maybe that is why is is so overhyped and worshipped.\n\nCliff Burton was essentially the Kurt Cobaine of bass, extremely untalented and oversimplistic, yet highly revered and lauded for no real reason at all.\n\nIf you wan't to hear some REAL bassists go listen to:\n\nTimi Grabber* Mercyful Fate\n\nSteve Harris* Iron Maiden\n\nGeezer Butler* Black Sabbath\n\nMarkus Grosskompf* Helloween\n\nJimmy Bain* Rainbow, Thin Lizzy, Dio\n\nGeddy Lee* Rush\n\nDan Lilker* Anthrax, S.O.D., Nuclear Assault, Brutal Truth\n\nPeter Baltes* Accept\n\nAngle Ripper* Sodom\n\nFlea* Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nJeff Pilson* Dokken, Dio\n\nRudy Sarzo* Ozzy, Quiet Riot, Dio\n\nBob Daisley* Vinnie Moore, Rainbow, Ozzy, Black Sabbath, ect\n\nMan, there are so many more that could wipe their @$$es with Cliff Burton, but Amazon only has a 1000 word limit so i will leave it at that.", "label": 0}

The production here is top notch as can be expected by Dre, but Eminem shows his\nproduction and lyrical skills on two of the better tracks on the album, \"Patiently Waiting\" and\n\"Don't Push Me\". The problem I see with this album doesn't lie in the production but in the\nlyrical content itself. The prevalent theme of gangsterism is all well and good, but 50 doesn't bring\nanything new to the table lyrically. When this type of hip-hop goes right (see 2pac or Notorious\nB.I.G ) an intelligent or story-telling aspect is brought through lyrically, but in the case of 50 Cent\nwe have Smith & Wesson anthems but no salvation in the form of smart lyrics.

I'm not sure if Rosemary's arrangements were used, but if so they do NOT suit Debby's  voice. I was also put off by some odd vocal stylings. Listen to the \"blue\" in \"Blue Skies\". Is she imitating Rosemary or just singing strangely? And the low key ending of \"Music That Makes Me Dance\" is a terrible letdown. If any song cries out for a big finish it's that one! \"You're Gonna Hear From Me\" is a great powerful song - but not here! This is the kind of singing and arranging done for/by a 65 or 70 year old whose voice has deepened and/or who doesn't have much power or range anymore.

I don't even want to think about what our world is coming to when 50 Cent has become the biggest thing in the music world. You know his music's bad when he attempts as hard as he can to be \"street\" and \"tuff\", and still fails miserably. Personally, I want to listen to music with substance, or at least to a musician who's honest about their talent and their music. I really have no respect for self-proclaimed \"pimps\" and \"gangstas\". I would much rather listen to educated artists who know how to spell and rap intelligibly. Honestly, I can't understand a word this moron sings, which is probably a good thing unless I wanted to hear about how rich he is, how \"pimpin'\" he is, how many \"hos\" he's slept with, or how he plans to shoot me.\nWow, 50's been shot nine times? That must mean his album is \"off da hook\" (as all the pre-pubescent 50 Cent fans would say). Wrong. This is crap. I'll admit, being shot nine times and living to tell about it is quite a feat, but it doesn't make you a rapper. It seems like anyone who has this supposed \"cred\" that comes with being shot or having been in jail is getting signed. What bull. Honestly, let's all go out and try to get shot so we can become famous rappers with \"bling bling\" and million dollar homes.\n50 Cent even looks like a fraud. The genius probably thought up the sleeve of his album all by himself. A great picture of himself looking hard and \"gangsta\", with a bullethole right through the middle. Why a bullethole? Just in case anyone forgets he's been shot, what was it again? Oh, yeah, nine times. Seriously 50, get over yourself. If the only crap you have to rap about is being shot, being a \"gansta\", being a \"pimp\", all the women you've slept with, and all the \"wankstas\" who hate you then you really have a pretty sorry life and a pretty pathetic amount of talent. The only reason I gave this album two stars rather than one is because the beats are pretty good (courtesy of Eminem and Dr. Dre of course, there's no way someone as unintelligent as 50 Cent could've come up with them).\nGo out and buy some Tupac, Run-DMC, or Notorious B.I.G., not only can you understand them, they actually have talent, and intelligent things to say. Even Eminem is better than this crap, he actually has opinions on serious issues. 'Get Rich or Die Trying'? Well it looks like you don't have to wait for that tenth shot to finish you off 50, you've surely earned enough money from all those people out there who actually buy into this sort of \"image\" to live lavishly for quite some time.", "label": 0}

This album was actually re-mastered pretty well but I just can't say the same for \"Music for the Masses\"; the most expensive re-issue with no sonic improvement overall. On Violator and Music of the Masses, I've found that the PCM audio files found on their dvd, actually sound better than the audio files on the album; I don't know, maybe it's just me?\n\nSo, I'm only giving this album 3 out of 5 stars because of the poor way it was put together. First off, if the record companies want to include all their B-sides or any rare remixes onto an album, you don't put them on the dvd! How's someone supposed to hear the B-sides off a dvd disc if you want to listen to them in your car's cd player?

{"text": "I ordered this album as I'm a big fan of the beach boys and was curious as to what hidden treasures Mr Love may have had on offer.\n\nAs usual the service from Amazon was excellent and the package arrived on time.\n\nAs it was a little too wide to fit through the letterbox I had to sign for it.\n\nThe delivery guy didn't look well, his brow was sweaty, his breathing heavy and his movement somewhat laboured.\n\nAfter I signed he stumbled away and seemed to keep repeating the words 'the worst of times.\n\nAnyway, I went back inside, opened the packaging, as a side note when I opened the package a gust of air that smelled very much like sulphur, filled my nostrils and I swear I heard a noise that sounded like 312 people in a casino lounge groaning in pain.\n\nUpon reading the track listing on the sleeve I was very disappointed that Mr Love has only one co writing credit on an album containing 10 songs. I can only assume he was saving his best stuff for the beach boys. Him bring the primary, and extraordinarily talented, lyricist of the group.\n\nAnyways, I put the record on the turntable, put the needle down and heard that wonderful pop and buzz as the record was about to start.\n\nThe opening line of the title track 'looking back with love' set the tone for the whole album, a most gruesome violation of the eardrums.\n\nMikes nasally voice singing lyrics made up of song titles, cultural nods & the obligatory use of the word 'excitations'.\n\nWhile that song should've been enough to put me off listening to the rest of the album I decided to persevere. Turns out I'm something of a madochist.\n\nWith each song, or rather nasally dirge, the listening experience became something of an ordeal and the song 'rocking the man in the boat' I found particularly disturbing given it's subject matter of activities that should not be discussed outside of the bedroom.\n\nThis was made worse by the fact I could picture mike love in one of his signature creepy poses moving ever closer to me, yet still I persevered.\n\nBy the time I reached 'paradise found' the final track on the record, I felt nauseous, slightly disturbed and very angry at myself for wasting almost four English pounds on that drivel.\n\nAs soon as the final song finished I leapt from my seat and stopped the record immediately out of fear that there may be hidden bonus tracks.\n\nIn disgust I took the album out to the yard, placed it on my barbecue and set the 12 inches of evil akight and the strangest thing happened, the flames burned green and an awful noise that sounded like an old man with rhinitis saying 'WHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENN' for about a minute.\n\nI would not recommend this album to anyone.\n\nListening to it was a very uncomfortable experience and made me want to shove hot knitting needles in my ears.\n\nI'm very disappointed that I'm obliged to give this album a minimum score of one star.

{"text": "Just finished reviewing \"Master of puppets\" and as for that album, I'll just say that I am not a heavy metal fan as such. This review is just to help people that are curious about the band and aren't really fans of heavy metal either. Hopefully I can indentify some songs for you on the album which have 'cross-over' appeal. I tend to like \"hook\" laden songs, and the one below has a terrific melody for a hook.\n\nThis album has one out and out terrific song-\n\nFade to black:\n\nThis song has a nice accoustic introduction, that bleeds into a beautiful guitar melody about the one minute mark. Yes...beautiful. Heavy metal and beautiful...doesn't seem right, does it? As with Master of Puppets \"Welcome Home\", I initially disliked the part where the music veered into heavy metal territory. However, this song has grown on me more than Welcome Home has. This is perhaps Metallica's best song ever-or at least, in the same league as Enter Sandman, which is currently my favourite Metallica song. The sheer magnitude of the heavy metal guitar sounds in the latter part of the song was initially off putting, but I have warmed to it, and it's not so weird to me anymore.\n\nAs for the rest of the album-\n\nFight fire with fire:\n\nThis song is the best of the rest. Again, it has a very nice accoustic guitar intro-Spanish flavoured, perhaps, before veering off into heavy metal territory.\n\nNothing else really stands out on this album-The call of Ktulu is not in the same class as an instrumental as Master of Puppets' \"Orion\". It does have some interesting, creepy effects though.\n\nIn Metallica's favour, though, is that they are not afraid to mix up their song's feel. Trapped Under Ice, and Escape have an interesting vibe to them.\n\nShould Metallica ever release a best of album, I think that Fade To Black is a definite must have selection. A best of album which included Welcome Home, Fade to black, Memory Remains, Enter Sandman and Orion would be a great album. It's unfortunate that Metallica haven't really ever released a great album...at least not with more than one song that I really like [p.s. Reload changes that...see my review of that great album here].\n\nN.B. I've also reviewed the following Metallica cds at this site:\n\nReload\n\nLoad\n\nand Master of puppets\n\nas well as Megadeth's \"Greatest hits\", a Black Sabbath compilation and Iron Maiden's \"Ed Hunter\" cd.\n\nP.P.S. Here are some songs I consider to be classics of the metal genre:\n\nMetallica: Fade to black\n\nMegadeth: Prince of darkness\n\nIron Maiden: Run to the hills [though it doesn't have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time]\n\nAC/DC: Hell's bells", "label": 0}

{"text": "Just about everything bad and good has been said about this album. 50 Cent's major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was (sort of like Nelly's \"Country Grammar\") but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it. 50 Cent's gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album, mostly about guns, sex, drugs, and money. The 2003 rap song of the year \"In Da Club\" was overrated to me, but it was a decent track at best. The second single \"21 ?'s\" I hated because of it's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries. The third single \"Many Men\" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence. The fourth single \"P.I.M.P.\" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version, although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G-Unit that doesn't appear on here is better. The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod, some I enjoyed and some that I hated. \"Patiently Waiting\" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album, as both of them have above average verses. The track \"If I Can't\" has a fast paced piano beat, that makes the song gangsta and listenable. \"What Up Gangsta\" will have little kids thinking they're hardcore repeating that song, because of it's catchy hook. 50 Cent's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD, because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets.\n\nProduction is done by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and more.\nIt sold about 9 million copies, so I'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen.\n\nLyrics: C+\nProduction: B\nGuest Appearances: B-\nMusical Vibes: C+\nOverall: C+\n\nFavorite Tracks: Patiently Waiting, Many Men, If I Can't, Life's On The Line, Wanksta", "label": 2}
{"text": "Hey guys. Howard Tuttleman here. I don't know a whole lot about this hip-hop/rap thing, but I here this guy I know named Joe saying words from it a lot. They are always some kind of threat or put-down. I'm not always sure what to say about this rapping-music, but I guess I can appreciate it because basically ANYBODY could play it, no matter how bad of a singer you are. Heck, 50-Cent was a criminal and even HE made a record. The idea I get of rap is that you think about how you feel and just sort of talk-it-out and try to make it rhyme. At first I really liked this concept because you could pretty-much SAY whatever you want, and if you can't sing-out those high notes, or if your voice cracks a lot, you have nothing to worry about. You just talk-it-out. Most people I know are pretty-good at talking. So I thought \"Wow! This is music for the common-man.\" But then I started to hear what they were REALLY using this medium for. Talking about yourself to try to level yourself up, and dishing out threats of violence or death to the other rappers who are trying to level-up. A viscious-circle.\n\nNow that would be just fine if they were just talking-around for a joke, but these guys actually shoot at each-other sometimes, and a few have even died about it. This in-turn makes them more famous, but doesn't that seem like a big-price to pay for fame and fortune?\n\nNow my best solution would be that they should stop trying to yell bad things at each-other, get to know each-other a little better, and maybe sort out their problems over dinner or coffee or something. They should leave the guns at home, too. Then, once they get to know each other they could bring their better attitudes to their songs.\n\nI mean, they're all in the same business togeter and doing well for themselves. Why not throw out compliments instead of insults? Encouragment instead of threats? This would make the music a lot more accessible to the general-public who can't relate to killing their colleagues. It would also create a sort of web-of-trust between artists.\n\nI would really like to hear some rapping on the radio along the lines of \"Hey there, good job on your last single. It had a good beat, keep up the good work, guy,\" directed at another rapper. It would make the other rapper more comfortable, so he might even make HIS next rap something like \"Hey, thanks man! I like your style too. We should hang-out more. How's tha family?\" Or just a general compliment like \"Hey, Nike's huh? I like Nike too. Where'd you get those ones? Hope you got a good deal, man\". They could make it all rhyme of course, in their own special ways.\n\nAnd as far as rappers telling everyone that they are the best-ever, and how everyone else is terrible, they could show a little modesty once in a while. For example, why not be more like \"Hey, I'm pretty confident about my music, but their is always room for improvment. I always strive to be the best, but don't get me wrong, these other guys are really good and you should check them out too\". Or maybe something like \"Hey, did you hear this other guy's album? It's so good that it inspired me to do better. You guys should really hear it\". You know how happy that would make the other guy? This could solve a lot of the violence problems between rappers, and could possibly prevent deaths. Just a few simple steps in commom-curtiousy.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting that ALL of these guy get along or whatever. I mean, some people just don't get along with each-other. However, instead of talking about how you hate them, you could be a little less hostile about it. Maybe something like \"Hey, to be honest I didn't really dig your new record. But it might not have been your fault. Your band might have been playing the wrong chords or something. You should come over some time and maybe I could give you a few pointers and take you out to dinner\". If he handled it like that, the other guy could very well be like \"Thanks for the offer. I'm not really a big fan of yours, but you seem like a good guy. What's your screen-name? We should talk more\". Do you see what this could do for the music-industry!?\n\nNow these are just a few ideas I've had, and you can throw in yours if you'd like. Like I said, I'm pretty new to this genre of music and maybe there is still something I'm not understanding. It's just that I've heard some of these threats and put-downs and thought how crazy that would be if say, the guy from Metallica sang about how much he hated the guy from U2, and started a blood-feud. Or if like, Tom Petty shot the guy from Weezer to death. That just wouldn't make ANY sense to rock-fans, but somehow this has become the norm in Rap-Music.\n\nI even heard that some of the rockers even DO make songs for each-other. Apparently David Bowie made a song called \"A Song For Bob Dylan\". AND IT'S NICE. He doesn't make fun of him or threaten to kill him. Imagine that. Let me know what you guys think.

{"text": "Well - I'm a huge RS fan, but I gotta say, that overall, this album is not the most inspiring work Rick has ever done.  His song selection is interesting, to say the least.  Some of the songs he covers on this release were boring when they were released originally, and he really has't spiced them up any here.\n\nI really look forward to each album Rick releases, as I think he is truly one of the most gifted artists of any genre.  He has the songwriting ability, the vocal ability, and everything else it takes to continue doing this work until the day he's no longer with us.  I sincerely hope though, that this album is not a sign of things to come.\n\nHis first original album in years (Karma) was a fairly slow paced meandering through the real world thoughts that had for the prior ten years kept Rick out of the public eye, and it was a great comeback album.  He did a live greatest hits, which showcased the amazing sound of his live shows, and followed up with one of the best albums of his career song for song (Shock Denial Anger Acceptance), which floated between outright hard rock, and the melancholy of Karma.  Now, his 3rd album since he's beein back in the eye comes out - and it's an album of cover tunes.  The only problem - he essentially covers songs that we only hear on lite-rock radio anymore, and therefore, won't garner the respect that he would've gotted with an SDAA2.\n\nI love Rick's music, always have, and maybe that's the problem - this isn't his music - I dunno.\n\nEither way, fans of RS will want (and rightfully so) this album, but I don't think this will engender many new fans (although the lite-rock radio crowd might disagree).  Can't wait until 20XX when he releases his next true album.  Until then, I'll probably stick with SDAA and Karma.\n\nOn a side - the production on this album is flawless, which we have all come to expect from Rick.  You can hear the individual voices, and instruments, quite clearly on a good sound system, which makes this a very pleasant (but still boring) listen.\n\nMarko", "label": 2}

Even though I'm not from that time, I still enjoyed Michael's earlier stuff. I also liked hearing Blame It On The Boogie, Shake Your Body Down To The Ground and Off The Wall. These are all GREAT tap your toe songs! The song, Can You Feel It, is also one of the many gems on this cd. Of course, many hit songs from the albums Thriller & Bad are also included. Many MJ compilations contain the same songs (Beat It, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man In The Mirror) but it is refreshing to ALSO hear Dirty Diana, Leave Me Alone and Smooth Criminal. We are also treated to hear the lost hits from Michael's Dangerous album, including In The Closet, Who Is It and Dangerous (the album's exiting track).

{"text": "I recently bought \"Rescue You\" and was extremely disappointed with it, so when I read all the rave reviews here on Amazon I was compelled to write a review of my own.\n-\nFirst off let me say that I'm only 26 and was not a fan of JLT in the '80s, I only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when I discovered Rainbow.  Once I got into Rainbow I went out and bought everything else I could find that JLT sang on.  I love Odyssey, Slaves & Masters, HTP, and most of Joe's recent solo albums.  I thought Holy Man was particularly strong, and really enjoyed JLT and The Usual Suspects as well.  Based on all this, I decided I had to have Rescue You.  Of course it was out of print until only recently, so I waited a long time before getting to hear Rescue You.\n-\nOnce I found out that Wounded Bird had reissued Rescue You I ordered my copy right away.  I was really looking forward to hearing this album.  Chronologically this album is sandwiched right between BENT OUT OF SHAPE and ODYSSEY, two albums that I really enjoy, so I was expecting RESCUE YOU to be a good album, if not great.  I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when I finally heard this album.  It's not terrible, but let me tell you that RESCUE YOU does not hold a candle to any other album that Joe has done as a solo artist or as a full fledged band member(the only exceptions being Fandango, which I have not heard, and the many one-off and guest appearances Joe has done, ie. Brazen Abbot, etc, which I have also not heard for the most part).  Here is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked about this album; you'll notice that the bad far outweighs the good!\n-\nThe Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible and dated the production is.  The drum sound is attrocious, with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound.  The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the guitarist might be playing.  Worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which are positively dripping off of this album.  I thought I was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice!  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike '80s rock or synths when they're used tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal's work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control.  We're not just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth \"stabs\" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted.  The songwriting is not terrible, but is definitely sub-par.  \"Losing You\", \"Rescue You\" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they'd been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album.  \"The Race Is On\" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I'd rather go listen to \"Spotlight Kid\" again, thanks.  Finally, the lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because \"rough\" and \"tough\" rhyme with eachother doesn't mean they should ever actually be used in a song!\n-\nThe Defense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe's voice sounds great.  Somehow Joe's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery.  Don't get me wrong, Joe's voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it!\n-\nThe Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung on, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison.  If you are a casual fan, don't waste your money.  If you are a completist like me, you are going to buy this album no matter what I say, so just don't get your hopes up.  To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, don't give up on JLT, because pretty much everything else he's ever done is better than RESCUE YOU.  Go out and buy THE USUAL SUSPECTS and rock out to \"The Power of Love\".  If your collection is missing RESCUE YOU, you're not missing much!\n-\nFinally, look closely at the reviews below.  One of the reviews states (paraphrased): \"if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU.\"  Well, I don't know anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi.  Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metal background.  I'd imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rainbow, and then JLT.  I don't think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it's not \"heavy enough\", but because it's not original enough, not timeless enough, and just plain not good enough.  If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTERS, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT's more recent work; however you will probably find RESCUE YOU utterly cheesy and unlistenable.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.\nThey still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (\"Stealing Rosemary\").  Both of these things are their saving grace.\nEach member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has \"Here Right Now\", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has \"Something That You Said\", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has \"Single By Choice\" and Michael Steele has \"Between the Two\".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even \"Ride the Ride\" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.\nOverall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  \"Song For a Good Son\".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (\"Ask Me No Questions\").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said\").  \"I Will Take Care of You\" is just downright lame.\nIn my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.\nSupposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.

But 50, come on you all.  So I just want to know what makes an MC (especially 50 Cent) so great.  Is it lyrical substance or being gansta?  Is it versatility, rhyme patterns, and flow or is it being shot, talking about cars, and pimping hoes?

{"text": "As my title suggests, Casting Crowns wants the people to get up and do, rather than sit back and watch, as the title to this CD subtly suggests.  Once you get into this disk, you'll get what I mean.  The major message that I'm taking from this one that we still have to be Christians outside of the building that some call a \"church\".  If you look the word up, a church is actually a group of people acting together or gathering together to serve Christ.  Serving Christ doesn't mean just sitting together on a Sunday morning in a building together and listening to the pastor and singing and reading the Gospel.  Sure, all of these things are great, but the way to really connect with your true Christian calling is by serving the Lord through outreach and participating in our communities the way his Son did.  These truths are evident in the tracks \"The Altar and the Door\", \"What this World Needs\", and \"Somewhere in the Middle\".  Another theme that I found on this disk is forgiveness.  This is found in my second favorite track \"East to West\".  I think this one is about a guy that is ashamed of something that he's done in the past, and if he can't receive forgiveness, he'll do it again.  However, the message here is that through God, you can find anything you need, and that HE is merciful and full of forgiveness.  Very powerful stuff.  My favorite track though would have to be \"The Word is Alive\".  The message to this one is self evident.  All in all, Casting Crowns hasn't made a bad CD yet, and I don't expect them to really.  Please buy this CD and listen to it closely.  Its messages may change you, or at least encourage you.  Peace and Love.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.\n\nOverall, not a great song to say the least.

{"text": "\"Zipper Catches Skin\" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded. It has some fantastic songs like \"Tag, You're It\", a tribute to 80's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B-Movie. \"Adaptable\" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album. And you have \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere\" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. \"I Am the Future\" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with \"No Baloney Homosapiens\". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. \"Make That Money\" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice. I prefer \"Flush the Fashion\", \"Special Forces\" and the best of this era \"DaDa\". Still, it's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import, if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection.", "label": 2}

All 4 hits from OTW are included, all 7 from Thriller and Bad.  All but one of the Dangerous US singles (Jam) are here, and Jam is one of my least favorite Michael Jackson tracks, so I'm not mourning it's loss.\n\nWe also only get two latter tracks, You Are Not Alone and You Rock My World.

I mean 1000times better than he is now. I just don't understand. Seriously go and buy Power Of The Dollar and you'll see what I mean. He was seriously talented before he joined Shady Aftermath.\nI don't know what went wrong... if it's because of him being shot in the jaw that affected his speech it is understandable because he flows much better on his past albums... but that's doesn't make and excuse for poor lyrics. 50 Cent already had the image that would appeal to naive kids, so if he wrote lyrics like he did before I'm sure it would've still appealed to them... but he really has dumbed down.\nReally... someone's already quoted what I gonna quote \"Love you like a fat kid loves cake\"  Plluurrse.... any 1st grader could've come up with that. I mean really if that's meant to turn on women he must be attracting some fat ugly hos.\nBottom Line: This album has it's moments....to be honest all the singles he has released are his best as well as a few cuts on the album. But the fact is 12 out of this 17+ track album is good.\nThe reason I deduct 2 stars os because of his poor lyrics and flow. I think \"If I Can't\" is probably his best track but hey that's just me.\nNow moving away from the album I just wanna let you know I hate 50cent and his Gorilla Unit Crew (are they called that because of their ugly mugs?) who knows... but what I do know is that 50cent had his shine in 2003 and now finally the fire is burning out. He has contributed to the joke hip hop has become today. Really, you wouldn't believe how many white suburban kids that go to my school listen to him. I'm not racist but when you attract kids who are not even ghetto or think killing people is cool you know you must've gone wrong somewhere. BUt hey why should he care. At the end of the die just look at the title of this album. Get Rich Or Die Tryin... and you gotta give him props... he knows at the end of the die f**k the fans... it's all about the dollar. And at least he's honest about it.\nSo should you buy it? Well if you want to contribute you the downfall of hip hop yes. This album does have it's guilty pleasure (no matter how much you love underground music) but still I would burn this and not add another $10+ to this guys fat wallet. I feel it's the production that saves this album.\nPeeaacceee", "label": 2}

{"text": "I was disappointed with this film.  I was thinking (or hoping) this film was going to be about the passion of knowledge, ideas, thinking, and any other form of mental stimulation; I really didn't think there was much of that in this film.  Maybe I'm just odd in the way I dislike Hollywood's usual portrayal of passion: love affairs et cetera.  Passion in this film was portrayed in the Hollywood sense.  There was brief mentioning of thoughts, the mind, ideas, the individual, et al, but I felt they were only in idle chatter, and not what really mattered.  Maybe all the \"Hollywood passion\" represented in this film turned me off, but I would have rather spent my time doing something other than watching this film.\n\nRecently I had the pleasure of a watching a different documentary film about Miss Rand called _Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life_.  And I think if you are looking for more details actually about her, her life, and her ideas, rather than love affairs which I thought were quite unpleasant within _The Passion of Ayn Rand_, _Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life_ is the film I think you'll enjoy to watch and listen to instead.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've been a fan of 50 Cent since How To Rob burst on the mixtape scene a few years back. Since that song, he's released a couple underground albums dominated by thug stories with a humerouos twist.  I was ecstatic to hear he signed with Shady Records and would be backed by Em and Dre about 6 months ago.  So how does his major label debut fair against heavyweights like Jay-Z and Nas?\nFor the most part, 50 doesn't stray far from the formula that made him an underground king.  Almost too much of the same.  I was thinking he would come with something other than the same old thug tales, and come out with a couple deep songs.  Instead, all of the lyrics in each song could have been placed anywhere else on the album and it wouldn't seem out of place.  There doesn't seem to be any common theme in any song.  Suprisingly the humor that was all over his past albums is almost non existent.  Also, when 50 tries to go outside of his Corner Bodega mode and into commercial tracks, the results are mixed.  In Da Club is very good, but songs like 21 Questions and PIMP just don't fit into 50's persona, and it's hard to actually believe what he's saying.\nThe album is not all bad, though.  In fact, it's a good CD.  Despite all the radio play, In Da Club and Wanksta are both very catchy, good songs.  Patiently Waiting featuring 50's boss, Eminem, is the highlight of the album.  Eminem's verse is just absolutely sick.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for his trite attempt on Don't Push Me.  50's diss to hip hop's biggest sellout, Ja Rule, is absolutely hysterical and Dre hooks him up with an absolutely sick beat.  Other songs to check out are What Up Gangsta, Many Men, If I Can't, and U Like My Style.\nAll in all, there's more to like on this album than dislike.  It's a good debut, and hopefully one which will serve as a lesson on what and what not to do for his next album, due out by the end of this year.", "label": 2}

On this particular album, the music doesn't have much of an edge, nor is it really catchy, and the lyrics no longer take us to another place(although this was a Gary Osbourne collaboration, not Taupin). As with every album that Elton has done, there are worthwhile tracks..\"Shine On Through\" is the only passionate song present, and I'm surprised it wasn't a single. \"Song For Guy\", while sounding like something you might hear in a grocery store, is actually a decent instrumental, but not really my style. The only hit from the album(in America) was \"Part Time Love\", not a horrible song, but again, what happened? We go from singles like \"Levon\", \"Rocket Man\", and \"Philadelphia Freedom\", to \"Part Time Love\"? The bonus tracks do make this a little more worthwile, not that they are anything great, but people are always hungry for some obscure recordings, and I do enjoy \"Ego\", a non-album, top 40 hit in 1978, that until \"To Be Continued\" was unavailable. Though in my opinion, Elton never has been able to completely recapture the magic he had with the earlier releases, his next album would be a little better(21 At 33), and then there is always \"Too Low For Zero\", \"Sleeping With The Past\", and his newest release \"Songs From The West Coast\".

'Dark Hollow' and 'I've Been All Around This World' are the best of the five, and show what the boys  could do with traditional folk-y material. But the sound isn't particularly  good (or terrible, for that matter), and this group of tunes don't inspire  me much; there's precious little of the American-beauty-ish karma here,  though that stems from the weak material. 'Wake Up Little Suzie' is a  rarity on record, and maybe that's for the best, as Bob forgets the lyric  in mid-verse. It's not terrible, and completists will want to have these  tunes, but this is hardly the band at its best in this era.\nII. Tracks  Six and Seven\nTrack Six, 'Smokestack Lightnin' is an 18-minute slow-burn  blues tour-de-force that morphs into a very enjoyable, high-energy jam  reminiscent of a freight train rumbling down the line. One of my favorite  Dead performances.\nTrack Seven, 'Hard to Handle,' shows you how this  song is supposed to be played, with a lot of energy and great guitar work.  If you hear this you will forever *hate* the lame, pretentious, glam-rock  version of this tune by the Black Crows. These two tracks are the pinnacle  of the Pigpen era, IMO.\nBuy this disc for the two great grooves if for  nothing else.", "label": 2}

Indeed, \"Marisi,\" the opening track, melds the Spanish guitar to some chill beats, but the wan vocals on \"\"Essarai\" seem to edge too close to dull. But \"Moonsmith\" and \"Overtime\" redeem things with some lightweight dub, and the spry accordion in \"Etoile\" gives that track some luster.

I like it.\n\"Every Man\" has a good sound, but so far it doesn't really grab me.\n\"Slow Fade\" is an amazing song--probably my favorite of the album--about compromises slowly leading to downfall.  The choice to use a child at the end singing \"O be careful little eyes what you see\" works very well.\n\"East to West,\" which has already gotten significant radio play as a single, sounds more like the old Casting Crowns and features some very good lyrics, including a poetic reminder that having our sin removed as far as the east is from the west means that Christ came in between us and it.\n\"The Word Is Alive\" is a long, powerful song that just has a lot of good content paired with great music.  I haven't digested it all yet--that will take several more listens--but I'll probably love this one more and more as I do.\n\"The Altar and the Door,\" strangely enough, is one of the weakest songs on the album.  I don't really like the sound of it that well, though it has a good message.\n\"Somewhere in the Middle\" is another one of my favorites.  It has a similar message to \"The Altar and the Door,\" but better done.  \"Fearless warriors in a picket fence\" is an image that will stick with you, and it's not the only good image in the song.  It also features cellos, violas, and violins for a more orchestral sound.\n\"I Know You're There\" I found somewhat forgettable, though not bad.\n\"Prayer for a Friend\" is simple and good, though poetically unremarkable.\n\"All Because of Jesus\" is pretty good, but not the most remarkable song on the album.  After this song and period of silence, however, there is a hidden song called \"White Dove Fly High,\" which I have learned is in Korean and English and was sung when Casting Crowns visited Korea.  It doesn't sound like Casting Crowns normally does, but I like it nevertheless.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Disclaimer: I am new to Lucinda's own albums, so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this just yet before hearing a few more. But it does seem like everything else has been steering me right here, with everybody telling me to proceed no further before checking her out. So now *please* tell me that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/West/dp/B000LXHGFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">West</a>&nbsp;is some kind of fly in the ointment. She sounds totally rasped out, like Stevie Nicks with a really bad cold. Please tell me that she's in a songwriting slump also. I find myself in accord with Big Jim's one-star review below - these songs don't feel like stories, let alone lyrics - there's simply too much line repetition to communicate much except dull emotion. If this were a blues album it would be one thing, but clearly it's not. And how can these be called melodies when all they do is hover around one or two notes in practically every song, showing off very little of her range. (Somebody please tell me that she displays some vocal range somewhere else.)\n\nComing from a pretty good appreciation of lady singer/songwriter/interpreters like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch, and others with similar talents, even ones with narrow but beautiful instruments like Rickie Lee Jones, I was hoping to add a little bit of spice to the rack - but this album is a huge let-down. When I learned that Hal Willner, Bill Frisell and Jim Keltner were major contributors to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/West/dp/B000LXHGFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">West</a>, I figured that I would at least be intrigued by *some* of the tracks - sorry - even after several listenings that's not happening. I really do like Lucinda's one track on the 2001 MJH tribute album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Avalon-Blues-A-Tribute-to-the-Music-of-Mississippi-John-Hurt/dp/B00005J9TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Avalon Blues: A Tribute to the Music of Mississippi John Hurt</a>, but then again I liked ALL of that 5-star gem. Somebody *please* confirm for me that this is *not* the best way to be introduced to Ms. Williams on a large scale.

The only reason his hit song is catchy is because it sports an awesome beat created by someone other than 50 Cent.  Of all of the famous rappers I have heard, 50 Cent has the least talent by far.  Everything he says sounds grumbled and there is no change in the tone of his voice.  In addition to his lack of talent, his lyrics are poor.  There is neither depth, nor substance.

{"text": "This is a great recording of \"Scheherazade.\" Quite possibly one of the most intense I've heard. I really enjoyed the energy that Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra brought to it. The two other performances are also very good. Borodin's \"In The Steppes Of Central Asia\" is played here with great authority. I wish Gergiev would record Borodin's other orchestral works, especially the symphonies. The other performance is of Balakirev's \"Islamey\" and it, too, receives a passionate performance.\n\nThe only downside for this recording is the audio. In loud passages, the audio sounds compressed. The quieter passages sound pretty good, it's just when the louder passages come it sounds as if it's being squeezed. There also seems to be a good bit reverb. Since this is a live recording, I'm able to overlook the audio. Live recordings are very spontaneous events to record. Sometimes the results aren't always satisfactory.\n\nIf you can get past the audio, this is a smashing performance. Full of passion, fire, and intensity.

His passing made me reconsider the sheer joy and artistic perfection of his music and dancing and the positive spiritual messages that informed his songs.

I now enjoy more songs than ever before. I know most think that people like me ONLY bought this record because of the hype. That isn't true if you never liked MJ's music than regardless of the hype you won't all of the sudden like his music. You have to be a fan of some sort prior to his passing. Sad that it takes MJ passing for fans bring his music to a level that he never saw when he was alive. I like most (if you never owned a MJ album) wanted to have at lease one ACTUAL record of MJ's to remember the good music he did. I'll add that listening to \"You are not alone\" is very hard now knowing that MJ is gone. Knowing that he meant so much to so many! It was like his way of leaving a final message! RIP MJ", "label": 1}

{"text": "Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.\nTake the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: \"Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light.\" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And \"Love In An Elevator\" is full of corny lyrics like \"They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more\" and \"Like The Staples, I wanna take you there.\" \"Simply Say I Love You\" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.\nThe only songs that really stand out are \"Maybe\" and \"It's Your Body\". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.\nAnother problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, \"So Gentle\". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song \"I Know You Want Me\" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.\nI still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.", "label": 2}
{"text": "The cd I have was released in 1999, called Eiffel 65 Europop. It is an Italian band that uses electronic voice manipulations to sing the songs. The most popular song is \"Blue (da ba dee).\" I think that one song is original and portrays emotion of feeling blue in a very real way.

{"text": "The quest to acquire all of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted \"low points\" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed \"Polka Party\" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not true, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a \"valley\" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).\n\nAfter listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.\n\nAl is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be \"Addicted to Spuds,\" his parody of Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love.\"  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  \"Living With a Hernia,\" a parody of James Brown's \"Living In America,\" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include \"Here's Johnny\" (El DeBarge's \"Who's Johnny\"), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; \"Toothless People\" (Mick Jagger's \"Ruthless People\"), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular \"Polka Party,\" which includes samples from various hits such as \"Harlem Shuffle,\" \"Venus,\" \"Sussidio,\" \"Rock Me Amadeus,\" and \"Papa Don't Preach.\"\n\nThe originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for \"Dog Eat Dog\" or \"Don't Wear Those Shoes,\" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of \"Good Enough For Now,\" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a \"just about average\" love interest.  \"One Of Those Days\" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.\n\nThe most infamous number from this album would have to be \"Christmas At Ground Zero,\" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from \"Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.\"  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9/11 gave the term \"Ground Zero\" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.\n\nDefinitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of \"Addicted To Spuds\" and \"One Of Those Days,\" and maybe \"Christmas At Ground Zero\" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for \"Dare To Be Stupid\" or \"Mandatory Fun.\"", "label": 2}

It takes a few minutes to shake off. So with that in mind, I guess it helped to put me into a deep sleep since I had such profound dreams.\n\nThe 'beware' comes from the types of dreams that I had. Not so much nightmares with monsters or anything. More dreams involving things that can actually happen in real life, but things that lead to terrifying results. Kind of difficult to describe.

As well, he is low on the list of Shady's best signed, Obie Trice has much more talent and sounds better than 50. And the reason that Em always sounds better than the person who's album it is, is because he always starts off his verse with a way to advertise himself, like in \"Patiently Waiting\" it has all the sound effects that become real intense and his voice sounds other-wordly.

{"text": "The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.\n\n As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.\n\n So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.\n\n Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover.

{"text": "After Alice in Hell, my expectations were high. I was quickly brought down to Earth and them sumarilly pummeled into the ground about 100 feet by the absolutely abysmal Never,Neverland.\nHowever, just when I thought Annihilator was a one album band, Set the World On Fire rekindled some of my hope....SOME.\nFirst, Aaron Randall can sing. Not only angry metal like Randy Rampage from Alice in Hell but also songs with range which was kind of nice. Unfortuantely that set the stage for Jeff (Waters) to explore more pop metal type songs. Something he didn't fully outgrow until the recent Waking the Fury.\nHaving said that the album can be split into two groups, pop metal reminiscent of Dokken and bands like them and songs that sound like the Alice in Hell Annihilator.\nOn the good side, Set the World On Fire, the two really fun songs; Don't Bother Me and Brain Dance and the absolutely awesome Knight Jumps Queen.\nThe other 6 songs range from okay to make me puke pop metal. The Edge is extremely excruciating (should have known by that title)\nOverall, I still think the album is worth buying, 4 great songs is still more than most bands can offer.", "label": 2}

You'll probably love it. But, short of maybe 3 or 4 great tracks, everything that made her music stand out in the first place is downplayed in favor of sounding more Grammy-ready, like...say...Alicia Keys? There's nothing here nearly as honest or  soul-wrenching as \"Simple,\" \"Brown Skin,\" \"Ready For Love,\" \"Always In My Head\" or really anything on the first disc. What can I say? I'm just not really feeling it as strong this time. Bottom line is, nice album--India fans grab it anyway--but I just I hope she takes a real sharp left next time around, 'sayin'?", "label": 2}

{"text": "First, I'll say that I've conciously been a Chicago fan since hearing \"V\" (by far their best work IMHO) in 1972.  Then I got their back catalogue, and realized that I'd liked their earlier stuff too, I just didn't know who it was.  Of course, being a stage band geek helped with my appreciation for horns.  I've been a professional musician since getting my union card in 1977.  I'm comfortable with any style from Motown to Nickelback and Metallica, and do it all well enough to have made a living at it.\n\nChicago is one of two bands whose albums I would buy without first hearing them, and have rarely been truly disappointed (except maybe 12 and 14).  I even liked the textures on \"Victorious\" from 19.  I waited and waited 15 years for new material, begged for SOS to be released after hearing a few unreleased tracks, bought the Big Band and the Christmas CD (both versions).  I really am a Chi fan.  I've seen them in concert many times since the mid 70's, and am always in awe.\n\nThat out of the way, I've only had this CD for two days, so my opinion may change, but while many of the songs are growing on me, I'm frankly disappointed overall.  I'd expected the first new album in 15 years, and the follow-up to SOS would be so much more...\n\nThis was the band that complained the major labels' demand for more ballads was stifling their creativity, yet they pile on more cheese than a deep dish pizza on the first half of this CD.  The opening strains are even copied from their earlier works.  I was almost expecting a rework of \"Hard Habit To Break\" at one point.  While it's true that nobody does the power ballad better, please try to keep it to a maximum of 2.  I don't care how cute Jason is, enough is enough.  And the over-use of the Fosterisms - the jingly-jangly keyboard sounds and those damned dotted-quarter note shots everywhere.  They were cool in 1986.\n\nSure, those first songs have some redeeming sections, but for the most part, they sound to me like throwaways from 16.  Maybe it is true that the band lost its heart and soul that fateful night in 1978.\n\nAhh... but the second half! \"90 Degrees...\" is cool, and delivers some truly old-school trademark horns, albeit a very short foray.  Unfortunately, the song itself is again stuck in the 80's, and reminds me a little of Toto, with Chi horns nailed onto the side.  There are a couple of other moments where the real band comes through, but they're too few and too short.\n\nI don't know why this band needs to hire session players for their recordings, or to recycle 80's material, or 70's material, for that matter.  Maybe it's their handlers...  Howard Kaufman did such a great job with Heart, after all.  Where's Heart now, you ask?  Exactly...\n\nLook at the biggest album of 1999 - Santana's \"Supernatural\".  Did Carlos write a bunch of \"Black Magic Woman\" copies?  Did he feel the need to half fill the album with ballads?  No.  He wrote (or collaborated on) songs that were current in style and production, that would get mainstream radio play, as opposed to AC and lite rock\\oldies stations.  His signature guitar style and sound let you know who it was.  The result was a hit contemporary work.  The kids thought he was a new artist!  Chicago could have (and should have) done the same - write some adventurous contemporary rockers, a few contemprary pop tunes (for radio and mainstream sales), and yes, a couple of Foster-free power ballads, then let Jimmy work his magic on the horn arrangements.  Everyone would have been happy.\n\nI really think they missed the boat on this one.  While I'm sure they'll get a couple of minor hits off this CD - both versions of \"Feel\" are catchy, for different reasons - it's not the album that is going to put them back on top. SOS at the time of its recording might have been...\n\nNot that it means anyting, but during all the Cetera\\Scheff comparison, has anyone correlated the timeline of the decline of this once great band?  For a grin, compare the record sales and size of the concert venues between the CTI-17 era, and from 18-present.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Luis Mejia (son) - Chicago's first musical direction was a politically charged band with an extremely thoughtful and meaningful but undertaking rock, '60s style, but later they went through their most critical approach into pop, although it wasn't until Chicago 13 where they stablished firmly into the genre. Love Songs compilations are always among my main buys, as I'm a mellow guy who really likes sentimental and romantic music, and Chicago's Love Songs contains not only their best romantic hits, but a collection of their most soulful pop and beautiful melodies, famous or not, it does contains some of their biggest hits like \"You're The Inspiration\", \"If You Leave Me Now\", \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry/Get Away\", \"Colour My World\" and \"Hard Habit To Break\", all of the being their most famous love songs, while the rest of the songs are minor hits, and, as Chicago is a pop band, their most beautiful songs are obviously romantic ones, so, in this aspect, the album is really good. But then comes the vast majority of bad aspects from the album, mainly those like Chicago's early fans won't be comforted with this album, as it doesn't contain any of the early rocker style from Chicago, also the fact that a lot of love songs were unnoticed for this compilation, so a better title would be \"greatest love hits\". So, musically there is actually a bad aspect, but apart from it there's also the fact that Rhino got too exagerate with so many Chicago's compilations, so we're destined to hear the same group of songs over and over again. Anyway, if you like Chicago's heartful pop, and you still haven't buyed more than two of their compilations, this stands as a beautiful, joyful and correct release.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I love Regina Belle.  She is third on my list of all-time favorites.  She  is soooo talented!  Unfortunately, these songs and arrangements reek.

For example, the best song on the album, 'I've Had Enough',  is mid-tempo'd, when it should have been a simple slow ballad a la 'The  Whole Town's Laughing At Me' from 'Reachin Back', with maybe only a piano  and a little percussion.\nThe lyrics of most of the songs are  unimaginative, childish even (not every line has to rhyme!).

Though he died in the early 80s (a plane crash with, I believe, two of his four kids on board), what continues to make Keith Green so mesmerizing for many listeners today is his heartfelt passion for Jesus and the Church. It is an undeniable quality you can hear as he sings and also in the lyrics he penned.\n\nGreen is not the most versatile musician with enormous breath in style. However, what he lacks in scope he makes up for in spades when it comes to his relevancy to most Christians... their fickle behavior... their selfishness apart from the love of Christ... their need for grace and mercy given all the frailties and shortcomings. His music, if listened to long enough, will for some individuals nag at the conscience, for others create a tear-fest, and even bring a few to their knees in prayer. And, it's all because Green sounds genuine, lived a sincere, passionate life for Christ, and had a knack for finding the right words that resonated (and still does) with many Christians.\n\nGiven the current shallow teaching in many Christian circles and the weakness for what is novel, colorful, or vogue over what is true and sensible... the work of Keith Green does indeed remain timely for the current age--especially among Protestant Evangelicals.", "label": 1}

{"text": "What is up with all the glowing reviews people are giving this disc?  `mezzanine' marked the end of my love affair for massive attack and I've never looked back.  I'm not even remotely curious about their latest release 100th window.  From what I've heard it's not even the full line up anymore.\n`angel' is a grating, irritating and annoying track.  Just because it's been used in countless films and commercials does not make it amazing.  I'm just not \"getting\" the attraction to that song. The only tracks that make this disc worthwhile are the beautiful collaborations with liz fraser of cocteau twins.  Liz's voice is beautifully complimented by slow, dark crackling beats on `teardrop', `black milk' and the first half of `group four'.  Unfortunately the second half of `group four' falls back into the annoying elements that made `angel' such an awful track. I wish someone would do trip-hop remixes of cocteau twin songs or liz would come out with her own disc of triphop dreaminess.  She could be the reigning queen of triphop and put this sub par disc to shame.  The only other worthwhile track is the oppressive darkness of `man next door'.  Horace Andy's depressing vocals, the dark mood of the track and the sample of the cure's `10:15 On A Saturday Night' make this another track to check out.\nOutside of that `mezzanine' is pure unfocused garbage.  If you haven't already, checkout `protection'.  The title track alone is goose bump inducing.  Who can resist Tracy Thorn's voice? Throw in Tricky, Nicolette and Horace you have a masterpiece.  `mezzanine' is far from that.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Being an enormous Jewel fan, I ran out the day the CD went on sale to buy it.  I was so excited to hear her, but a little skeptical about the first single.  I must say the first few times I heard it, I was irrate, looking to email her personally to condemn her for her horrid change in sound.  However, it has been played frequently and I am starting to appreciate it.  I take it with a grain of salt knowing it isn't the music Jewel created to make me fall in love, but I can still hear her lyrical genius shining through the glitz and the 80s glamour.  \"Haunted\" is perhaps one of the greatest songs lyrically on this CD.  \"Fragile Heart\" is a little too reminiscent of \"I'm Sensitive\" from Pieces of You.  However her release, \"Intuition\" is a horrible song both lyrically and musically.  One reviewer commented on her lyrics from this song saying it is proof she isn't selling out, but I say when she writes lines like, \"sell your sin, just cash in\" it means she has chosen the easy road of selling out. Yes I am aware that Jewel uses sarcasm as a strong tool in her music, but never this blatantly which leads me to believe that she has chosen the easy road.  I cannot condemn the whole CD.  Overall, it is a fun upbeat CD, but it just isn't the same coming from Jewel. I fear this is just a simple summer fun weather CD that will hit the back of my shelves come wintertime and forgotten.

It's more along the lines of Black Sabbath in terms of the slow, plodding grooves and dark lyrics.  If I had one complaint, it would be the production.  In the movie, they say that this album is the best sounding album they've made (which makes me wonder what the others must sound like).  But I'm digging it.

{"text": "Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics cover every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke.\n\nThis collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement, which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\n\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\n\nThose who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\n\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ's birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\n\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature and inspiring.\n\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\n\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ's followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\n\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\n\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn't get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\n\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\n\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It's not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the life.", "label": 1}

{"text": "There are two aspects that must be considered in reviewing this recording - the performance and the engineering. I think the work itself sufficiently well-known for there to be no need to describe the work. But there is one aspect that often is overlooked.\n\nFrom the latter part of the 19Th century, to choose an arbitrary point in time, a separation into two styles of composition can be discerned in Russian composers: those who's musical style reflected their Russian heritage, and others, like, perhaps Glazunov, reflected a more international style. And there were some somewhere in the middle, perhaps Tchaikovsky while definitely retaining a Russian flavour, was also trending toward the international style in some works.\n\nThe music of Rimsky-Korsakov however, had the sound of Russia clearly present. The trouble is, in coming to the present work as the relevant example, many performers have presented beautiful performances, but with the Russian flavour almost entirely suppressed. In this performance, Gergiev restores Russia to the music. This is a performance that I believe the composer would have loved. There is much passion, and much beauty in this interpretation. What some reviewers hear as \"roughness\" is the pagan heritage of Russia. So I heartily recommend the performance. But the sound!\n\nI am reviewing from the SACD release on very high-quality equipment. How one reviewer can describe this as being of demonstration quality is beyond me. The over-riding problem is the reverberation. It sounds as if it was recorded in a large, empty, auditorium, with the microphones in the next room. There is no distortion, but the reverberation destroys the clarity of the sound. For a DSD mastered SACD, this must be one of the worst recordings produced. Dynamic range is limited, and frequency bandwidth does not sound as one normally expects. From most of the reviews, I would assume the CD is taken from the same DSD master. And, again from most, but not all of the reviews, it appears that reverberation remains a major issue.\n\nSo much as I admire the performance, giving back to Rimsky-Korsakov his \"Russian-ness\", if the CD has the same sonic shortcomings as the SACD, my recommendation is to sadly avoid this one.", "label": 0}

{"text": "John Michael Talbot began is career in the sixties as a country-rock artist, playing and touring with industry giants.  Because of a profound conversion experience, he set out on his own path of writing and singing songs expressing his journey of faith in the Franciscan tradition of the  Catholic Church.  Over the past twenty-five years, Talbot has recorded an  unbelievably broad range of Christian music encompassing many styles, from  solo voice and guitar, to orchestra and choir.  He has put to music the  classic prayers and liturgy of the church, as well as written original  material in both acoustic and clasical styles, with a depth of theological  and musical integrity.  In contemporary Christian music, where glitz and  glamor have become an unfortunate by-product, Talbot rises above the  commercialization by singing songs, and living a life of humility and  service. His songs have been a powerful influence on me and my spiritual  journey.  I have sung and played his songs in my United Methodist  congregation, at church camps, and in my own spiritual retreats.  More than  anything else, his beautiful music and his life are a witness to the power  and presence of Christ.  These discs are a collection of his music from  across the years. I strongly recommend them to everyone.", "label": 1}

What is to be said for his album. I like it. There are alot of tight beats and some banging tracks \"In Da Club\", \"Poor Lil Rich\", \"IF I can't\", \"You like my Style\" etc. The Ja Rule diss track \"Back Down\" is incredible, along with \"Many Men\" and \"High all the time.\" There is nothing groundbreaking here at all, but it is a solid album and that is good enough for me.", "label": 2}

{"text": "When I first bought this title, I was miffed to find that it is a CD-R.  One of the reasons I stopped buying bootlegs--apart from the expense--was the trend of bootleggers to issue CD-Rs, and then maintain there's, quote; \"no difference\" between a CD-R and a regular CD.  True; the sound may be the same, if you can get your player to play it at all, but the durability is closer to a vinyl LP.  i.e. If it gets scratched, or dirty; you're SOL.  And to add insult to injury, the guy I bought it from (from Recall Records?) swore up and down it's a regular CD.  It's not:  At least not the one he sold me, on a couple of counts:  a) My CD burner plays CD-Rs with ticks, while CDs it does not (that's 'cause it's an old burner), and b) It looks like one.  So this loses one star for that.\n\nThen there's the sound quality.  Yup: It's from a record.  I hate this with a passion.  If it's available on-line NOT from a record, why don't the jerks who made this thing use the on-line sources to improve their CD-R before selling it to you?  (Then they can scream it's \"remastered.\")  In this the bootleg mentality prevails.  So it loses yet another star.\n\nBut all that said; this really isn't a bad album.  The Beatles are definitely raw here, and it's not hard to see why they didn't get a record contract from this demo.  But it's still the Beatles, and the music is still fun.  And in spite of being from a record, the sound quality isn't all THAT bad.  It's not like it's a bad recording of a record, or the record is exceptionally scratchy:  It's just a record.  So caveat emptor, indeed, but if you can get it for a decent price, this is a pretty cool album, and definitely a must if you're a Beatles fan.", "label": 2}

I'm not overly enthused about any one particular  song, and most of the music, arrangements and lyrics make for an overall  who-cares effect save for the instumental \"Carla/Etude/Fanfare.\"  Elton's piano playing is mostly light and bouncy (ala Caribou) rather than  forceful and moody (Blue Moves) which is not necessarily a bad attribute.", "label": 2}

(Michelle Branch) - I LOOOOVE Michelle Branch when it comes to this song. WHOLE different story with \"You-Know-Who.\"\n4. Invisible (Clay Aiken) - Pretend that the Kidz Bop Kids were in a singing comeptition with Clay, and they won. THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD COLLAPSE!!! In other words, Clay should've.

Here Without You (3 Doors Down) - OK, I LUV this song and the vid, too. It also got #1 in some countdowns on MTV and VH1 stuff.

NOBODY can sing like Joel, except Benji, but that doesn't count!!!\nOK, that's all I can review so far.

Such as, \"We'll play jacks and uno cards.\" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.\n\nSo overall, a good song, not a great one.

First, There is no depth in any of these songs, only melodic in the sense of copying entire phrases from Bach, Vivaldi etc, nothing that is original and no real melodies to be found. To sum up this cd, It's a compilation of copied phrases from real composers with improvised fillers. For what it is, it's a neat gimmick, but not real classical music. Yngwie is a excellent rock electric guitar improviser, but for himself to pose as a classical composer is a insult to classical music. As for the playing itself. Yngwie does a decent job, but if we are to compare him to the best classical musicians, this sounds sloppy with no dynamics. Electric guitarist Tony MacAlpine or Michael Angelo have much more controlled technique. Yngwie shines best in his early Rising Force albums with Jens Johansson.", "label": 0}

I think that if Coldplay were American, they perhaps would sound a lot like Band of Horses. While I don't believe that this is an album that people will be talking about too much a decade from now, it is nonetheless a solid creation that certainly has a significant place at the table with the aforementioned peers. They certainly have a more focused sound than Rogue Wave, and to my ears, their lyrics are more earnest than those found on the Shins' albums. And there are moments in which their melodies send shivers down your spine, especially on the album openers \"Is There a Ghost\" and \"Ode to LRC\". This music definitely is perfect for a road trip through forested mountains and grass-hewn plains. It certainly brings to mind images of nature, and hearkening back to the simple beauty of the world we live in and that we are a part of.

I don't mind melodic singing, or real singing at all. I'm not just a death metal listener. I listen to Power Metal and Prog as well. The instrumental work is sorry, the singing is decent at best, and the songwriting is terrible.

Like bookends, the first track is Nujabes' 'Battlecry,' the song that kicked off every episode. Likewise, the last track is MINMI's 'Shiki no Uta' (Song of the Seasons), the poetic closer for each episode. There are lots of great animation themes that only exist as a thirty second piece of music or the rest of the song falls short. An example of this is the theme to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/the-Boondocks/dp/B000F8O2QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the Boondocks</a>&nbsp;animated show. In contrast, it is deeply satisfying to hear the entire three minutes and twenty seconds of 'Battlecry.' The music between the opener and closer is also compelling. Given the eclectic nature of the music, an exact genre or musical style is difficult to pin down. \"Departure\" is a relaxing combination of jazz with pop, rock and hip-hop aesthetics. While urban music tends to have a digitally processed feel, this project keeps an organic groove that can only be created by musicians playing actual instruments. At times, it comes close to smooth jazz but nu-jazz is probably the best single descriptor. The mostly instrumental soundtrack manages to combine relaxing with hip -a feat that is seldomly achieved. Urban beats usually lay the foundation for smooth melodies. The first six tracks are by Nujabes while Fat Jon plays ten tunes. Given a shared musical vision, most listeners would have a difficult time distinguishing between the two musical entities. The Wikipedia entry for this disc indicates that the song 'Aruarian Dance' receives regular airplay on the XM Radio station Chill. This is for good reason, it's one of the album's highlights. While this music can work for active listening, it is best employed as ambience. While we know that the music works well in the background of martial arts anime, it can also be a hipster's soundtrack to a romantic evening. Comparing \"Departure\" with the other four Japanese soundtracks, I'd rate this as the best. I'd rank them all in the following order: 1) \"Departure,\" 2) \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Impression/dp/B000BD132U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Impression</a>,\" 3) \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Masta/dp/B000BD133O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Masta</a>\" and 4) \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Playlist/dp/B000G89T58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Playlist</a>.\" It can be fun to find these songs within the show, but Samurai Champloo is not required. \"Departure\" is strong enough of an experience that anyone can enjoy it with an interest in chill music.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have been a fan of Jewel since \"Pieces of You.\" I loved that album and when \"Spirit\" came out, I felt that it was another good one. By the time \"This Way\" came out i wasn't really interested in her new songs, and just stuck to her old music. Then \"0304\" came out along with \"Intuition\" playing constantly on the radio and I was so stunned by her new image I had to listen to the whole CD for myself. After complaining about how she was nothing but a \"Britney Spears knock-off\" and how she didn't even care about her true fans, I am ashamed to admit i enjoyed \"0304.\" While I skiped over \"Intuition\" everytime it played, I really liked a few of the tracks. I don't think her music will ever be as good as \"Pieces of You,\" and that fans either have to stick to her old stuff or accept her new image. In the end, I give the CD 3 stars but her image zero stars. She was truly an original and has now been cloned into a mainstream artist. If you are an old fan, i advise you not to purchase \"0304\" but maybe borrow it from a friend or the library to get rid of your curiosity or to accept her new music.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I am a huge Type O fan. I have seen them over 20 times and have driven hundreds of miles to do so. My wife and I have been waiting for this album and subsequent tour for years. We had tickets to see them in Philly last time  but thats when Peter had his drug incident and the tour was canceled.\n\nAnyhoo, so I pre order the album and wait with baited breath. When it finally arrives,  I am almost instantly disappointed. I have played in bands throughout the years and I know when jamming with a group sometimes you try to get something going and it just isn't working. Usually you stop playing and move on to something else. Most of these songs fall into this category. Unfortunately for us, Type O went ahead and finished, recorded, and released them.\n\nPeter's usually well crafted lyrics have been replaced with words that a 6th grader could have written. \"she burns me down, down, down to the ground\". What the heck is that? As one reviewer wrote, there are only two songs of note. The one, September Sun, is ok. This is mainly because its a rehash of their greatest song \"love you to death\". this song even suffers from the same silly lyrics being repeated ad nauseum for the last minute or so of the song. I don't even remember the name of the other song that I somewhat liked, but it doesn't matter anyway.\n\nTo all of those reviewers that rave about this album, whats wrong with you? Wait, I bet you all liked Metallica's St. Anger too... for any true Type O fan, this album is a grave disappointment. My wife and I we're psyched to go see them at Sonar in Baltimore, but after this album came out, we'll just watch their \"Symphony For The Devil\" DVD at a loud volume instead. The bottom line is, don't bother with this.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Terribly repetitious, terribly repetitious, terribly repetitious, te..... well, you get the idea.  Lucinda used to write great songs, detailed stories that were sung with achingly clear feeling.  I have to confess that I got suckered on this one, I bought the Lucinda brand blindly.  Car Wheels on a Gravel Road was such a great album, so full of strong guitar licks, meaningful lyrics, passion.  Each song was unique, special.  On West, you can hardly tell one song from the other.  It all drones into one long background tune fit for the dentist's office.  I give it one star for the title cut West, and maybe for Fancy Funeral, but also because there does not seem to be a clear zero-star rating available.  Sorry Lucinda, give it it it another another another try try try please.  Maybe take the songs on the road first, see what sort of audience reaction you get (or not) before releasing.

{"text": "I have been a great fan of Don Moen all the time as I became a Chirstian many years ago.\nI am not impressed with this album, not because the songs.  There are no point for me to get this album for the song as I have all the songs from the original releases. Therefore, all the songs are excelent I would say.\nTo me, Best of Don Moen are (in random order):\n1. Rivers Of Joy (I have his authorgraph in this album when he came to Kuala Lumpur concert many years ago)\n2. God with Us\n3. Worship with Don Moen\n4. I Will Sing\nHowever, buy this album is because I am interested in the DVD Bonus materials.  For the songs? No thanks, I stick with original releases which has a better flow of all songs.\nSo is this the \"best\" of the Don Moen? To me, it is not.  Don's album has been best of the best, When you select the songs out from the best of the best, it doesn't mean become Best of the \"Best of the best\", it has lost the original flow of the songs from the original songs.\nIf you are new to Don Moen, and wish to try his songs, I have no doubt that this is a good album to \"test\" it; else I would suggest you stay with your previous owned original releases of Don Moen's album, or you just want to go for the bonus materials.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I will offer a disclaimer up front that I prefer the older sound of Chicago over the newer, but I took my time formulating this review after listening to the cd several times until I felt I could look at it as an individual album instead of comparing to earler Chicago albums with different band members.\n\nThe cd contains 12 new songs that are primarily ballads or pop tunes that would be at home on most easy listening radio stations out there.  There are two versions of the song \"Feel\" presented, one to open the disc and a second to close it that contains some more horn work then the first version.\n\nThe vocals are clear, generally crisp and soulful.  The band continues to be blessed with having three very capable singers that can share lead duties in Robert Lamn, Jason Scheff and Bill Champlin.  The songs themselves are the equivilant of a nice spring day, pleasant and inoffensive without being too hot or cold.  The songs have a very polished sound to them.  While the songs are fine to listen to, I had a hard time finding anything to really latch onto and sink my teeth into that made me want to listen to it over and over again.  The forementioned \"Feel\", along with \"Caroline\" and \"90 Degrees And Freezing\" are probably the songs that have the most potential for repeat listening.\n\nHow I view the music is I see the cd as being full of potential background music for a low key party.  There's nothing that anyone would object to and pleasant enough to set a mood without any of the songs demanding your attention to pull you away from socializing.\n\nIt's not a bad cd, its well produced and easy to listen to.  There's just nothing that demands your attention and sets it apart from anything else on the market anymore.  That's a terrible shame, because this is one very talented group of musicians that created a style of music back in the late 60's and 70's that was different and unique unto themselves.  That sound that set them apart from others has morphed into songs that as another reviewer remarked, are designed to 'play it safe'.  They do play it safe and while there's nothing wrong with that, a person can't help but think about what kind of album they would put out if they made one strictly for their own pleasure instead of worrying about trying to please the masses.....", "label": 2}

She has appeared and performed in all the Hillsong albums except the latest release (This Is Our God, 2008), as she stepped down as worship team leader and handed it off to Joel Houston.\n\nChange Your World was produced by Zschech and David Holmes, and it's great! Darlene effortlessly and seamlessly brings her vocal and musical talents into the solo crowd, and makes for an awesome worship experience. While some might consider it in the same genre as pop, this is not what I consider a pop album, but pure contemporary Christian. Although some of her material from the Hillsong albums remains, Holmes and Zschech's songs bring honor and praise to God, as well as a fresh sound, which is a nice departure from the live Hillsong recordings.\n\nIf you are a fan of Darlene and Hillsong, then I recommend Darlene's solo albums.", "label": 1}

{"text": "\"Surf's Up\" is by far the Beach Boys' worst effort. It's not so much that they wanted to try branching out from something other than beach music, it's that the subject matter is a huge downer and completely out of left field. I don't know about you, but I don't want to hear the Rolling Stones doing a polka record. That's what this album feels like...way too far out there.\n\nThe songs aren't the best either, Even Brian Wilson's contribution, \"'Til I Die,\" is weak. To me it sounds like something never originally intended for release. There was a lot of conflict between Brian and the rest of the band when recording this record. I think the tone and quality of the songs had a lot to do with that.\n\n\"Feel Flows\" is the only good track on the album. It has a different feel than the rest of the songs (not uncommon for an album with only one hit), and although not the normal BB song, it still has the BB vibe.\n\nSave your money, get the \"Feel Flows\" mp3 and pass on the rest - or you might end up looking like the guy on the album cover.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Alice Cooper's 1982 \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is more straight-ahead rock and less New Wave than his two previous albums, but contains some material that seems like leftovers from \"Flush the Fashion\" and \"Special Forces\".\n\nIt's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.\n\nThe best cuts are the galloping opener \"Zorro's Ascent\"; The fiery, clever \"Tag, You're It\" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant \"I Better Be Good\" sounds like a leftover from \"Special Forces\", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on \"I Like Girls\" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (\"What happened? Run out of gas?\" etc).\n\nAmong the rest: \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)\" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the \"Killer\" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower \"I Am the Future\", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.\n\nSome of the lyrics get a little silly, as on \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of \"Hello Hurray\". The rocking \"I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)\" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.\n\n\"Adaptable (Anything For You)\", \"Remarkably Insincere\" are actually both UNremarkable.\n\nAlthough \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is not a bad album--and would be decent for any other artist, Alice is capable of much more than what's here.\n\nThree Stars--an average Coop effort.", "label": 2}

{"text": "First of all, I must say that this album is not all that bad.  The songs are all good, though you need to understand Portuguese to really appreciate them.  But having listened to a large chunk of Joo Gilberto's recorded output (and no Stan Getz beyond this album), this is a disappointing album.\nIt's got to be one of the most overrated albums in music history.  Essentially, it boils down to Stan Getz using \"exotic\" music he does not understand as a background to long loud solos that don't fit it.  If you listen to the Gilberto's original Bossa Nova recordings (sadly, currently out of print) and compare them to this album, you can't fail to be struck by how the former were very much about rhythm and songcraft, not about masturbatory improvisational soloing as this album is.  The instrumentation and orchestration in those albums is all put in service of the song, and the songwriting is superb.\nThe songcraft, however, is sadly lost for the overwhelmingly English-speaking audience of this album because (a) they don't speak Portuguese (or, Spanish, for that matter), (b) the \"translations\" of \"A Garota de Ipanema\" and \"Corcovado\" are DREADFUL, (c) Stan Getz is too interested in the limelight to lay his musical ego aside and put the song first.  In short, this album suffers from a terrible clash between the sensibilities of its two namesakes; and the Anglophone audience that endlessly lauds it does not even realize it.\nWhen you add the fact that Getz made an order of magnitude more money off this album than everybody else on it (hell, Astrud Gilberto reportedly made a grand total of $120 for a night of work), the above comments take on a more disquieting significance: here we have yet another case of a powerful first-world musician exploiting \"exotic\" musicians to market himself to an Anglophone audience, while never really caring to understand the music involved.  Thus the real underlying theme of this album: the power assymetries between the US and the rest of the world.\nAll that might be excused if Joo Gilberto sounded good in this album.  But in fact, compared to most of his recorded output, here he sounds absolutely dreadful.  The guitar sounds dead.  There are rumours that Getz had the album reequalized to make the sax sound louder, at the expense of the rest of the instruments; at any rate, there is just no treble in Joo's guitar.  And his interpretation is just too lethargic.  Joo Gilberto is the only interpreter I'm aware of who combines \"nearly silent\" with \"immensely funky\".  Yet this album lacks the second element.\nIf you have some reason for worshipping Stan Getz, I guess you don't need my opinion to judge this album.  If, like me, you find yourself rooting for Gilberto in this recording, look elsewhere.", "label": 2}

I contacted some of you, but I'm writing this for the rest whose addresses are not available.\n\nI wanted to tell you that I found a CD of the original Ariel Ramirez recording on eBay.  The seller is Musicshop780 and the eBay store is \"Music from Argentina.\"  I just bought the CD, so I don't know if they are reliable or not.

I don't mean to hurt your sales.  But if somebody is looking for the original recording, you don't carry it so it doesn't hurt you anyway.\n\nThank you all for your reviews.\n\nPS:  I don't mean to insult Carreras, I think he has a delightful voice but I agree that this Misa needs something more meaty, and over all, somebody who's \"been there,\" somebody latinoamericano who can really feel the pain that's behind each one of these pieces.

{"text": "HOAX! It's a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a definite hoax. It doesn't say how much the sound is slowed down, because chirps cannot ever sound like a boys' choir as played on this CD. Bear with me here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we'd still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, albeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional to human:cricket life, which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every minute to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency of, say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can't hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can handle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of your computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be there).\nAnd what does a single chirp really sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear the individual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency chirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp). NPR reported some crickets have 8, others have 11 beats within a chirp:\n[...]\n[...]", "label": 0}

{"text": "I had high hopes for this when I found out that Jewel has made a new album. I was surprised. It is good pop music, it has good lyrics and the melodies are also great (of course not all, but most). The problem is that all that is left of the 'old' Jewel I liked so much, the way her songs were on her older albums, is the voice and the Songwriting. Everything else has changed a lot. The music style is completely different, instruments were added so the songs now sound like the average modern-pop-songs from the radio. You can still hear the excellent songwriting behind the music if you listen carefuly enough. If you just hear the song while doing something else, you're almost sure you've heard the one or the other song before... I guess she's now working with a producer who also produces other pop stars.\nI would've rated this above average (4 stars) if it was from an average singer/songwriter. But it is Jewel, a great singer/songwriter that is capable of so much more, so it's only average (3 stars) for her.\nIf you have never heard of Jewel yet and you like Christina Aguilera and alike, this is your CD. I guess you'll love it.\nIf you know the old CDs of Jewel, especially her first album, be careful with this one. You may like it, but it may kill the sweet image of a innocent girl you had, happened to me.\nSometimes less is more.

{"text": "Word of mouth and buzz helped make \"Menopause\" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case in this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or \"Capitol Steps\"/\"SNL\"/\"Mad TV\" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, and weak.  For \"My Husband Sleeps Tonight\", a parody of the cringey oldie \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback \"What's Love Got to Do with It?\".  That almost defeats the purpose.\nMost men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, testy temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children.\nFor the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's \"Rutland Weekend Television\", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.

{"text": "One comparison between this CD (promoted as \"Their First Live Album In 20 Years\") and 1991's \"AC/DC Live\" tells you the main problem with this band...they absolutely refuse to shake up their setlist in any significant way.\n\nOf the 19 songs here, 12 appear on \"AC/DC Live\". Another one, \"Hell Ain't No Bad Place To Be\" (which seems to come back tour after tour for no particular reason, certainly not because it's one of their well-known radio hits) is available on 1978's \"If You Want Blood You've Got It\" (featuring orignial vocalist Bon Scott). Two more, \"Dog Eat Dog\" (also featuring Scott) and \"Shot Down In Flames\", are on the live disc from the \"Backtracks\" set released a couple years ago.\n\nThis leaves four songs appearing on a live album for the first time, all from the \"Black Ice\" CD, which this tour was supporting.\n\nI saw AC/DC live twice, once in 1985 and again in 2000. In that time, their setlist changed by maybe 6 songs, and 3 of those were the token new songs from the album they were touring behind.\n\n\"The Jack\" and \"Let There Be Rock\"...does anyone outside of the AC/DC faithful even know these songs?

{"text": "AZ is back again with A.W.O.L., which came about due to some label scuffles with Koch records who was supposed to release AZ's \"Final Call\" album. What's ironic about AWOL is that I knew this album was going to sound the way that it did. I disagree with anyone who rated this with 5 stars. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\n\nFirst of all, there is only 1 DJ Premier produced track contained \"The Come Up\" along with 1 Buckwild track. Outside of those 2 tracks, the beats are somewhat bland, and obviously don't compliment an MC of AZ's superior talents. So I could imagine what AZ must have went thru selecting his beats, being a talented solo artist,lacking the connection of a sidekick producer. This is proof why it's tough for so many MC's to stand on their own without in house beat connections. Especially with tracks being sold for an average price of 30 - $60,000 per track. Some of the tracks such as \"New York\" w/ Rae and Ghost have already been heard before (The amplitheater break from Wild Style...already used by Common).\nOn \"So Sincere\" AZ sounds as if he's struggling to keep up with the tempo. \"Street Life\" is another dull track that does nothing to standout either, even the late Half a Mil sounds out of place on this one. AZ also tries to conform to the masses on a couple of generic club bangers as well. Secondly where's Nas? I know we are all accustomed to seeng Nas pop up on an AZ album. I thought that the \"Serious\" Nas/AZ collabo would have been included, but sadly it wasn't. However there are some high notes such as \"City of Gods\" , \"AZ's Chillin\", and the already mentioned \"The Come Up\".\n\nUltimately, I was really dissapointed with AWOL as a whole. This album makes \"Aziatic\" look like a masterpiece. But I am not dissing this album completely, and I am a true AZ fan. I have all of his albums, and I still believe that none of his solo efforts have come close to matching the brilliance and smoothness of \"Doe or Die\". AZ desperately needs a signature sound and solid production in order for this to receive a higher rating from me. \"Doe or Die\" is the only album that had production that actually complimented him with the likes of Buckwild and Pete Rock to name a few. I think a lot of these other reviewers love AZ as an artist too, but don't have the courage to tell the truth. Someone like AZ deserves more than just one Primo and Buckwild track accompanied by relatively unknown producers with mediocre talents.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This Lord's Supper came out when CCM was just leaving its infancy and, for those who may not know, was a piece of music born of great personal pain. Christian albums were worth their weight in gold at the time because there were not that many artists and, as far as we were concerned, couldn't produce them fast enough. One or two web pages would have held the entire collection. But this one was radically different as it was a return to a style of music that, while not completely rejected, was the type that CCM was reacting to. John Michael Talbot's first two albums (CD's today) were of a rousing country rock variety and he was a virtuoso on guitar. But then he dropped out of sight for an extended period of time and, amongst us fans, there was no clue as to what happened. And then...The Lord's Supper appeared and it was unique and, I believe, still is to this day. He consented to an interview with CCM magazine and told us that his wife had divorced him. Understand that in that era, a Christian leader who got a divorce lost a lot of credibility (right or wrong). The interview indicates an extraordinarily painful time for the man. It was a wonderful group of believers that loved him back to spiritual health and he chose Franciscan vows. From that sprang this album and you should know that the entire choir is made up of those people, none of whom had ever sung professionally or even been in a studio. The Lord's Supper is a prime example of God redeeming the moment and JMT opening himself to it. In the ensuing years he fell in love and was allowed to marry (which is allowed in his order) and from that sprang Come To The Quiet. So what am I saying? That JMT has done us the service of allowing his pain, his journey, and his relationship to God play out in his music. As far as I can see, he reintroduced worship music back into CCM as these albums sold as much as ever. It is my hope this gives the reader background for an even deeper understanding and appreciation for the depth and the healing music of The Lord's Supper. As the last words of the last song, beseeching God, say, \"Lord, we are not worthy. ...only say the word, and we shall be healed\".", "label": 1}

{"text": "I, and my fellow Marines heard, \"I'm a man\" a thousand times a week in my Marine Corps (the P and S are silent) barracks in 1970.  We had over a hundred men in that open unit and I never heard one man complain that they were tired of hearing it.  We had only vinyl then and it took me years of tapes and disks to appreciate the records I once complained about.  For some reason, the MP3 just did not evoke the feelings I experienced in the barracks in my first year as a Marine.  Of course, I was only 19 years old then but, in my mind today, no less the Marine and ready to go at any time my country calls for me again.  I only wish that I took better care of my own copy, purchased a year later.  Now, after reading up on the issue, I find that the only way I could get a non remastered copy would be to buy the record from someone who DID take care of their own copy.  I am thankful I live under capitalism - even with all the socialist arrows shot into it - because I feel the optimism that it naturally brings with it gives one hope that they too might be able to find their own copy of, \"I'm a man\" as well as possibly measuring up to that level of testosterone - even back in the 1970's. I doubt greatly that even in the US, the average man cannot hope to attain the level of testosterone of the greatest generation - even in the women in the 1940's.  Anyway, I think that Steve Winwood still has the best version of \"I'm a man\" available to the average person today.  I sure liked the original one from CTA though.  It sure brought out the feeling of greatness and possibility that today's \"music\" falls far short of.", "label": 2}

But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.\n\nThe lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, \"We'll play jacks and uno cards.\" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.\n\nSo overall, a good song, not a great one.

I'm not too crazy about the cover or title track.  They're both too girly for me.  (Yes, I'm a man and I listen to the Bangles.  There's nothing wrong with that.)  I think they have some pretty good songs here.  \"Something That You Said\" is one of them.  \"I Will Take Care Of You\" is a beautiful piece of work, it could almost make you cry.  I almost did when I first heard it.  \"Grateful\" is a good sleep-time tune that a parent could sing to a child.\nI don't care what anybody says.  You can't hear Susanna Hoffs' voice and not fall in love with it.  It's impossible.\nAnother thing about the Bangles, they still know how to break peoples' hearts.  They prove it on \"Ask Me No Questions\", \"I Will Take Care Of You\" and \"Song For A Good Son\".  I don't think there's an album they've done where they don't have a song that will bring you down.\nThere is another song I don't care for on here and that's \"Here Right Now\".  For a while, it was played all the time on the satellite radio.  It was like the only Bangles song they'd ever play if they ever did play one.  When it comes to the Bangles, I'd rather hear anything, but that.\nI'll tell you something else, Bangles tunes are very hard to get out of my head.  Listening to my favorite singers doesn't help either.  I don't know what it is.  I think it's got something to do with that voice of Susanna Hoffs'.  It's a nice voice, I'll give her that.  It's probably just a gimme but... they're women.  I think that's the thing.  Female artists are harder to get out of my head then male artists.  I don't know why.\nOver the years, the Bangles taught us a few things.  Good music doesn't just come from men.  They don't need men to sound good.  That's what's great about them.  These 4 women can sing, write and play just as well as James Taylor, Paul Simon, Sting, Elton John, Gordon Lightfoot, Bob Dylan, Jimmy Buffett, David Bowie, Hall & Oates, The Doobie Brothers, The Rolling Stones and yes, The Beatles (who they dreamt about being all-female versions of in the 80's).

I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of \"Cold, Cold Heart\". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's \"Beulah Land\" on his tribute album.

This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here.

{"text": "Right Said Fred and Blind Melon; Daniel Powter joins the ranks of the poor one-hit wonders who were destined to crank out one overly played radio hit that grinded on everyone's nerves, and then disappeared. \"Bad Day\" is the first major goodbye song on American Idol, and as that was the first season I really became a fan, I started noticing on message boards, and various other entertainments sits, what is the name of that song? I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.\n\nThe song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.\n\nSo overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware.

{"text": "Get Rich or Die Tryin is a great debut album for 50.\n\n\"Intro\" standard. The CD starts with \"What Up Gangsta\", has a great flow with excellent lyrics and beat, with a good chorus. The next song is the best on the album \"Patiently Waiting\" features Eminem delivering a great 2nd verse. Great 1st and 3rd verses by 50 and good chorus. \"Many Men\" is a weak track, filler. \"In Da Club\" reinvented the word party track, one of the best 50 song ever. \"High All the Time\" is another weak filler track with nothing special at all. The next is a song about guns \"Heat\" is okay, kind of catchy. \"If I Can't\" has some good rhymes but is not standout at all.\n\n\"Blood Hound\" featuring Young Buck picks it up a little, with fast paced rhymes and a good beat. \"Back Down\" has got a great beat but isn't the best lyrically, but it's listenable. The next song talks about being a \"P.I.M.P.\" great track with a good beat and chorus, and excellent verses. \"Like My Style\" isn't very good, kind of annoying and repetative. The next song \"Poor Little Rich\" isn't very good either, skip it.\n\nThe last three songs are good. \"21 Questions\" has got a awesome flow and it features Nate Dogg. The 15th track \"Don't Push Me\" is downright excellent featuring Lloyd Banks and Eminem, Ems verse is particularly good. \"Gotta Make it to Heaven\" is a good song to end the album, nothing special but good enough.\n\nOverall Eminem and Dre really found some talent in 50. This album is much better than his next, The Massacre, which turned out to be exactly that.\n\nFavorites(in order):\n\nPatiently Waiting\n\nDon't Push Me\n\nIn Da Club\n\nP.I.M.P.\n\nWhat Up Gangsta\n\n-Kyle Walker", "label": 2}

Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track.\n\nAS a matter of fact, Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD.  He's very good on the title track, Outside and decent on a couple of others.  However, that last song, Throught It All With You, Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit.\n\nAlso many of the songs do not have solid hooks.

{"text": "The three stars I have given are there only because the Amazon page requires me to pick, so I have chosen a neutral number since this is not really about the movie.  To explain...\nThis is by way of a meta-review, that is, a commentary on how to consider the reviews here rather than the TV production or even the book.  DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THEM!  Not, at least, until you have the information to judge them on your own.\nThis does not mean 'watch the tape or DVD' or even 'read the book', because neither of those will give you the necessary understanding of the central character.  Even the Academy Award nominated biographical documentary, \"Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life\", while very good, still cannot give you enough information since it is only a few hours long and cannot possibly cover the full scope of this remarkable woman.\nThe reviews here range from nasty to quite good, but you can't be sure which is which until you understand what all the fuss is about, and the ONLY way to do that is to read what Ayn Rand wrote.\nMost people start with her two main novels, \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\", and they are worth reading even if only as examples of great fiction.  However, you should not stop there, because she wrote broadly of her views on morality, political theory, art, and the deepest intricacies of philosophy, but she also wrote on a myriad of smaller subjects, like her stamp collecting, or why she liked Marilyn Monroe, or what music she liked.  It is in the breadth of her writing that you can find the real Ayn Rand.\nAs I have always warned people, don't believe a thing anyone tells you about Ayn Rand (including me) until you know enough about her.  If you are truly interested in what she really was like, you need to first read four or five of her books (you pick).  Learn what she had to say and judge for yourself.  Then you will be able to understand why some people are so attracted to her and others so hate her, and why some of these reviews are valid and others are not.  But you have to do it yourself.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I'm a big Steve Winwood fan, and most Winwood fans like (if not love) \"Arc of a Diver.\"  I guess I just don't get it.  \"Arc,\" for this reviewer, represents the absolute low point of Steve Winwood's career.  Gone is the high-octane British R&B of the Spencer Davis Group.  Gone is the eclectic experimentation of Traffic and Blind Faith.  And the later pop-rock genius of \"Back in the High Life\" and \"Roll With It\" are still far off on the horizon.  Instead, \"Arc\" reveals an experienced rock icon who's run out of ideas but wants to record something anyway.  And, to make matters worse, instead of getting some other musicians or a talented producer to help him along, he tries doing it all himself in his home studio.  The result is a synthesizer & drum-machine adult-contemporary sludge with virtually no redeeming qualities.  The radio hit \"While You See a Chance\" and the plaintive ballad \"Slowdown Sundown\" are the highlights - but only by comparison with the rest of the album, which is almost unlistenable.  \"Second Hand Woman\" is a bad attempt at disco, \"Night Train\" is tedious attempt at a hard-edged sound (which Winwood would unfortunately perfect on the title track of \"Talking Back to the Night\"), and Winwood has to almost drag the lifeless beat of \"Spanish Dancer.\"  As a Steve Winwood fan, I can only say this is one album that should never have seen the light of day.", "label": 0}

In an episode where Brian Wilson talks about the 1981 Mike Love album LOOKING BACK WITH LOVE, Love, appearing self-conscious, motions to Wilson as if he'd like to change the subject.  Perhaps Love foresaw a vicious review I found on a Beach Boys fan's web page on the band members solo L.P.s, but I must say I find LOOKING BACK WITH LOVE to be, well, okay.  I give it two and a half stars, rounded off to three.\n\nThen, I find it tricky to rate art because what you take to it matters as much as the work itself.  LOOKING BACK WITH LOVE, a collection of remakes and originals, came out in 1981 on Neil Bogart's Boardwalk Records, which at the time seemed to be the second chance corral for artists who had made their names elsewhere - Love's stable mates at the record label included Ringo Starr and Joan Jett.\n\nAnyway, I finally picked up LOOKING BACK WITH LOVE over the past year or so and while the music has yet to stick with me much, when I've played it several songs have been pleasant enough.  I know nothing about Jim Studer, who composes the four of the record's five original tunes with Love and other collaborators, none of them Van Dyke Parks, but note my toe tapping to \"One Good Reason\" and \"Paradise Found,\" the latter a duet with Joanie Summers. As for the remakes, with his good-time vocal style Mike Love hits the mark on Bobby Day's \"Over and Over\" (most famously done by the Dave Clark Five) and the pop staple \"Teach Me Tonight.\"\n\nWell, it is the only solo album by Mike Love, one of the main singers of the Beach Boys and a chief collaborator of the pre-PET SOUNDS Brian Wilson songs that made the band what it was.

What's different with Billy is the way he changes his voice according to the intensity of the songs. For instance on \"Doing Something Right\" his voice is crystal clear while on \"Why, Why, Why\" his voice is deeper, more nasal, with the famous Texan twang. Likewise with \"That Changes Everything\". A bit like Josh Turner but with not as deep a voice. And then \"Little Bit Lonely\" comes up. A bad and sad Reggae. Willie Nelson's bad influence (see his Country Man album)?. And after that, from one ballad to another, more or less interesting. In any case, a total loss of energy at the end of the album except for \"Whole Lot More\" that wakes us up at last. The last one \"She Knows to Do With a Saturday Night\" very much influenced by the wonderful \"Living All Night\" by Patty Loveless, but unfortunately not as good.

{"text": "I absolutely LOVE this CD set! I was born in '86, unfortunately too late to be a part of Michael's rise to his King of Pop status, but I've loved his music from a young age. I remember listening to the local Oldies radio station growing up and dancing to the Jackson 5 songs. \"Will You Be There\" was the song of my childhood and will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nI went and purchased this set for myself the evening I learned of his passing; I had yet to own any of his music and wanted to make sure I had some of this amazing artist's work in my CD collection. I was lucky enough to find the Limited Edition 3.0 version with an added third CD. There are a few songs that I still wish were on here: \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" \"I'll Be There,\" \"Childhood,\" \"Give In To Me\" and \"Scream.\" But, even with those tracks missing I do not regret buying this compilation one bit. It still has many, many other hits from his unbelievable career. If you've been thinking of getting this, do it - especially if you can find the 3.0 version. The music on these CDs have brought back memories that I thought were long lost...to me, this is priceless! I highly recommend this to any fan of Michael's, new or old!\n\nMichael indescribably impacted the music industry and his millions of fans around the world. We lost a legend on June 25th, 2009, but his music will live forever. Like the saying goes - \"legends never die.\" Thank you for the music, Michael. May you Rest in Peace!", "label": 1}

{"text": "UPDATE - OK, I need to update my original review.  After listening to this CD, an additional 200+ times, I have to admit I would have to give it a higher rating.  The CD did really grow on me and I came to really enjoy it, particularly the first 5 songs, and really \"September Sun\" and \"Tripping a Blind Man\". Track 9 \"Ode to Locksmiths\", is also really good.  However, I still stand by that at least 10 mins of the album, if not 15 mins, could have been axed due to the over repetitious segments and intros that TON seems to have with a lot of their songs.  Also, \"These Three Things\", I DO NOT want to hear Peter singing about his views on abortion.\n\nOK, so I would REALLY give it 2 1/2 stars, however, since i can't give half stars, it doesn't deserve 3.  I would like to say, right off the bat, yes, I too, am a BIG TON fan.  However, I will NOT sugarcoat a review or be blinded by what is put out on this CD just because I really like these guys.  I just finished it, from womb to tomb, and I have to say this really falls short.\n\nA primer first, my music influence ranges from, my favorite, RUSH, to TON to Celldweller, but I also love stuff like Tom Vedvik and Global Communications, so my interests are not just cemented in Goth Rock, or the likes thereof. And, I too, have been in the music field, so I'll try and put a \"professional\" opinion on this review.\n\nWhen I listened to this CD, I was amazed at how much repitition in licks and hooks this album has, not only within itself, but also with their last three recordings.  From the begining of Dead Again, with the pick scraping down the strings, to the ending of the song, which sounds just like the ending of \"Angry Inch.\"  Now, I can just hear the avid, or rabid, TON fan saying, \"But it's their thing, that's what TON is, it's their sound.\"  Well, I prefer to have constant originality and not rehashing songs that sound just like 4 or 5 others before it.\n\nLike one other reviewer wrote, they do have some chick singing in \"Halloween in Heaven,\" and yes, her voice is far from great.  In fact, it's rather dull, almost sounding like she had a slight head cold.  Sorry if she finds this review negative, but I call them like I hear them.\n\nWhat is slightly impressive is some of the guitar solos.  What is even more impressive, if it's really Kenny playing them, and not having them substituted, like he did on \"How Could She.\" As much as I love these guys, they do fall short in the musically talented arena, compared to the likes of Rush, Yes, and such, as well as second seat players (insert band here).  However, TON will also be the first to admit they are not star performers in the given roles, but what they do have, is what it takes to sound significantly different from anyone else, and that's what makes them a star act.\n\nI just wish, after waiting nearly 4 years, is that something a little more \"orginal\" from this \"orginal\" band could have been produced.  I absolutely loved \"Life is Killing Me,\" \"October Rust,\" and even Peter's least favorite recording, \"World Coming Down.\" Although I found myself taping out a beat hear and there, or just sitting back and trying to focus on the song, this recording offers no real catchy hooks, muscially charged impressions, and no real \"POP\". ( And I don't mean \"pop\" as in \"pop music\") At times the music almost sounds like a ditribe of repetitiveness.\n\nSome people talk about giving it an x amount of times listening to it and then \"dreaming\" about a song and suddenly falling for this album.  I just don't see that happening, and it really shouldn't have to, especially if you really like a band.  The really sh**ty thing about this is, watch me listen to this a dozen more times and then start to come over to the dark side.  Hmm, doubt it.\n\nI still love these guys, and yes, it will always be in my collection and on my mp3 player.  I just hope they get back to thier old ways, soon.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Michael Jackson was a very talented artist.  It's a known fact that his father was a very serious perfectionist and pushed Michael Jackson from when he was the age of five.  This was something that led to nightmares, and a scar that probably never healed.  However, we have benefitted from it greatly.  Let's just hope that his father doesn't do the same to Prince Michael, Paris, or Blanket (and there are rumors that the evil Joseph Jackson has discovered performer potential in at least one of these kids).\n\nThere are a couple of different versions of this album, there's the international release, and the U.S. release, which is the one I have.  From what I understand, the international release has the shortened versions, while the U.S. release primarily has the full versions.  Some of the tracks are in different orders, but all of the songs except for three are the same.\n\nNo matter which version you have, the album still shows the full history of Michael Jackson, skipping the first ten years and the last seven years of his life.  The album shows all of the different sides to him.  It shows the child side, the more political side, the soft side, the more funky side, the disco side, et al.\n\nSeveral people will complain that a few songs are missing, but that's what compilations basically are.  All of the really important songs are here.  However, I would definitely suggest putting \"I'll Be There\" on it, but at least they put \"Ben\" on it.  At least one of the slow songs from the early years is here.  Several people have suggested putting \"Scream\" on it, others have commented on \"Say Say Say,\" but \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean,\" \"Thriller,\" \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough,\" \"Man in the Mirror,\" \"Heal the World,\" \"ABC,\" \"You Are Not Alone,\" \"Bad,\" \"The Way You Make Me Feel,\" \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),\" and \"She's Out of My Life\" are all on it.\n\nThis album is a great album by a great entertainer.  Let's just hope that his father doesn't do what was done to him to his children, no matter how much we could benefit from it.  Michael Jackson wished for his children to have happy lives, being loved and cared for, not being pushed to go beyond their limits.\n\nR.I.P.  Michael Jackson", "label": 1}

{"text": "I first heard the Missa Criola in 1970 and immediately bought the LP, the one with Ramirez conducting his own works.  I played the grooves off it for years.  But it's not available on CD, so I had to make do with this very pale imitation.\n\nThe charm and strength of this music is its folk roots, and the feature that made my old LP so incredible was the raw energy and momentum of the performance.  The soloists became the music, fitting in beautifully with no attempts to raise themselves to a position of greater glory.  The energy and drive of the entire production was infectious; it was impossible to sit still while listening to it.\n\nIn this recording, much is made of Carreras.  Yes, he's got a nice, if somewhat light-weight, voice, and were it not for his participation as one of the Three Tenors, singing with much better-known and accomplished colleagues, he probably would never have been considered for this recording.  His voice is much too mannered, operatic, and light for it.  In his throat, this music sounds like art songs.  The choir is secondary to him, singing like a back-up group for some star, which is the reverse of the way it ought to be.\n\nAnd let's not even talk about the tempi.  Ramirez conducted his work with zest and energy.  This recording seems to equate reverence with s-l-o-w tempo, with the predictable result that the music lags and is stretched out so far as to lose all its momentum.\n\nEverything that's wrong here goes back to the fact that Ramirez wrote it in the folk idiom and this recording is done as a finely polished vehicle for an opera star.  The music has been made secondary to the performance of the tenor soloist, instead of the reverse, and the choir has been rendered insignificant, which, for this inherently choral piece, is quite an achievement, if a dubious one.  There's no energy here, no drive, no... life.  If this was the only way you'd ever get to hear the Missa Criola, you probably wouldn't be too interested in hearing it again.\n\nI still have my old LP.

{"text": "I have been a loyal JMT fan for 10 years now.  A very small amount of time considering how long he has been in the Music Business.  And I have collected all 30 or more studio albums he has conceived in his 30 plus years. From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the likes of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's.  JMT is far from his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his complete library, but more than likely, not everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library.  But this is a great start.  This I think is a perfect start!  It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like...\"Lilies of the Field\"......\"Healer of my Soul\"....\"Hiding Place\".....\"The Pleiades and Oriion\"...and \"Sunrise\". I am not Catholic, but I don't believe JMT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all in. You will find his music has a touch of Brilliance to each song. His Guitar picking is something to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on many of these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart. His Voice is something I imagine God Himself enjoying from Heaven. Above all.....I cannot get enough of John Micheal Talbot and look foward to each new release.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The only thing \"punk\" about this CD is Sum 41's total lack of regard for making anything important or memorable.  It starts out with an annoying, unlistenable metal parody/tribute/whatever that you'll definately want to skip every time you put in this disc.  Just look at the album cover if you have any doubts about the music contained within.  Some of the songs sound okay on the radio, sure.  Fat Lip is actually a good single, as is Motivation.  In Too Deep is simply much too poppy though.  As for the rest of the contents, forget about it.  Disposable generic pop-punk a la Green Day and Blink 182.  An album really should be more than just a means of landing songs onto the radio and making a bunch of cash.  It should be some sort of statement, something creative, something artistic, something honest.  Well, Sum 41 got the honest part down, because I have a feeling that the immaturity, bad attempts at humor and overall unoriginally of this CD reflects their personalities perfectly.", "label": 0}

This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like \"Ben\", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out \"Never can Say Goodbye\" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is \"Jam\".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of \"Dangerous\" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of \"Bad\" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....\"Farewell My Summer Love\" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.

I.E. in P.I.M.P, and I quote \"I'm your friend, father, and confidant\" Since when do pimps claim that they're your friend or father nevermind confidant? Real pimps just use their hoes. This guy is a fraud. Plain and simple. All he talks about is getting shot. I can't believe how blind everyone is. People who think this is good music just have no clue what they are talking about. 50 knows he's a bull$hit rapper, but why does he care, he's laughing all the way to the bank. Not one song on this album is worth listening to. Out of the whole album the thing worthy of letting your ears hear is Eminem's verse in \"Patiently Waiting\". What's the golden rule? Never let someone outshine you on your own track. And oh my god it's not even close. 50 shouldn't even have one line in that song he's that piss poor compared to Eminem. As far as I'm concerned Obie Trice is a better rapper than this clown, and he's pretty much close to as bad as it gets. This CD has been out too long for my review to thwart anyone from purchasing this album, but if you did buy it, I honestly think you could have burned your $ and still got more out of it. 50 cent is the reason I don't listen to the radio anymore, because he pollutes the airwaves with this pure garbage.

I wasn't too fond of \"Lifesong\" when it first came out but now, it's one of my favorite CDs to listen to!!\n\n\"The Altar and the Door\" consists of tracks that convicts the lost and saved souls. \"East to West\" talks about how huge God's forgiveness is and how important it is in our lives. \"Every Man\" is about how there is always hope for every man alive in this world: it doesn't matter who we are: there is always hope and this hope is Jesus Christ. \"The Word is Alive\" is an amazing song: one of my favorites. It doesn't matter if you are saved or not, God's Word is spreading everywhere and when it is heard, there is a seed planted. \"What this World Needs\" is a convicting song for us Christians: we get too much in the way: we rely too much on our efforts and forget that Jesus doesn't need us: He just wants to use us.

Since the last section of the nap program is a voice telling you to reverse your journey and wake up, it isn't very helpful to someone hoping to fall asleep for the night.

To my shame I must confess that I don't have every verse to these songs memorized, so this is a great way to learn more because (I can't say this enough) they lyrics are awesome.\n\nThe only song I was already familiar with is \"O Freedom,\" an old spiritual.

{"text": "...But it should be warned that if you already own \"HIStory: Past, Present, and Future\" then you're more or less paying for the same thing.  However, the good news is that if you don't, this is by far the best collection of Michael Jackson's greatest hits!\n\nUnlike HIStory, they actually have the goods.  Not just the same old stuff we've all heard thousands of times (i.e. we get more than just \"Billie Jean\" \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller\").  Not only that, but we get to hear some classic Jackson 5 songs.  And of coure, \"Ben\" which was one of his greatest.\n\nIf you take a look you'll notice that \"Off the Wall\" \"P.Y.T. Pretty Young Thing\" and \"Human Nature\" are here. And I was very impressed that this time, they remembered \"Smooth Criminal\" (the song everyone seems to think Alien Ant Farm did).  They also threw in \"Dirty Diana\" and \"Leave Me Alone\".\n\nLikewise, we can easily see that \"Dangerous\" was not a forgotten album.  This time spawning more than just three songs, but actually seven.  And what a fine seven they are, the ones we actually LIKED... well, maybe some of us could do without \"Heal the World\".  But luckily, \"Man in the Mirror\" will save you from that.\n\nReally, this is a great compilation.  We get to see Jackson before he became a total nutcase in the media.  Remember, it doesn't matter what he looks like now, or even how his music sounds now.  It's all a matter of what his music can still bring to you now.  You can't change the past, and the past was good!  So let's keep it and remember it when we buy this.\n\nLastly, I still have to throw in that if you got HIStory and Number Ones, this might not perk you up right. However, for two CDs the list price isn't bad (HIStory debuted at about forty dollars).  So if you want the GOOD Jackson songs, get this album.  It's more than just his solo career, too.  It's his career with the Jackson 5 as well.", "label": 1}

{"text": "For Mary J. Blige, even her drama has drama. She's made her career as pop's rough-around-the-edges diva not only by airing her dirty emotional laundry but also by presenting each album as an episode in an ever-twisting soap opera: New romances, heartbreaking setbacks, teary vows to persevere and more new romances. That's why it's hard to believe her when, in the Quiet Storm of \"Stay Down,\" she pledges, \"The drama will not last forever.\" She's promised as much before, and on her eighth album, she's still thriving on turbulence; her most common protagonist is the heart-scorched but indomitable love survivor.\n\nThere are signs of contentment. On the title track, Blige swears perfect equanimity; admiring her fine self in the mirror over a bouncy, girls'-night-out synth beat, she declares, \"I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine.\" The other shoe drops on cue once a man enters the picture, and the songs waffle between down-tempo affirmations (\"I promise never to get hurt again\") and tempestuous run-ins with the bums who disappoint her. Her voice has grown more confidently fleshy with every album, and on \"Roses\" and \"Nowhere Fast,\" two slithery, you-crossed-the-line tracks produced by \"Tricky\" Stewart (of \"Umbrella\" fame), she is both a seductive pillow-talker and such a fury that hell hath no other. Still, as the angrier tracks pile up, they start to sound like incomplete excerpts from a script--we get her exasperation and demands in abundance, but her man's crimes are never clear.\n\nThis is a story that can go on forever, and much of the CD feels as though it could have been made anytime in the last 15 years, from Blige's reliance on relationship platitudes (\"Feels like sunshine/Feels like rain\") to the whiffs of Dangerous-era Michael Jackson--her most fruitful collaborations here are with Usher, Ne-Yo and producer team Stargate, all unapologetic Michael worshipers. It's an implicit recognition that in love there's really nothing new, just flirting and fights and make-up sex.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Band of Horses return for their second album Cease to Begin with a slick radio-ready sound, nearly abandoning the My Morning Jacket-like spacey production that dominated their debut, Everything All the Time.  I suppose that this was a conscious effort on their part, perhaps representative of their cross-country move from Seattle to South Carolina.  The only problem for me is that I loved every moment of their first album.  I think I might have loved it for its very ramshackle-ness (that a word?) and spontaneity.  Both of these are gone, for better or worse, on the new album.\n\nOpener \"Is There a Ghost\" is probably my favorite track, and it is the song most reminiscent of their first album.  Though it only has about two lines worth of lyrics, it builds with a steady intensity, dropping some truly catchy hooks along the way.  The second track, \"Ode to LRC\" tries to capture the epic qualities of past songs like \"Funeral\" and \"Great Salt Lake\" but doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts.  There are a few too many shifts in the song, and none of the different parts really grabbed me the way the aforementioned songs did.\n\nThe middle of the album feels like a slump to me.  \"Detlef Schrempf\" is interesting because of its title (reference to beloved former Seattle Sonics player) and its abandonment of guitars in favor of a soulful organ.  The end of the album, however, packs a surprising punch.  My favorite of these last few tracks is probably \"Cigarettes, Wedding Bands\" with some really sucker-punching lyrics and a bittersweet melody.\n\nCease to Begin may be an unpleasant surprise for longtime Band of Horses fans.  The band really sounds like a whole new entity on this album, mainly because of the up-front production.  Ben Bridwell's voice no longer cascades behind waves of reverb, and the guitars punch right through the mix instead of drifting and chiming among the other instruments.  Personally, I liked the older sound of the band, but I think they still have a lot of potential.  I suspect that the new radio prevelance of this album will earn Band of Horses a lot of new fans, and good for them!  Just don't forget your roots, guys, and keep working on those epic crashing guitar scapes.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?\n\nTo stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.\n\nAfter gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.\n\nOn the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.\n\nA MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):\n\nI have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.\n\nIf you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You're just jealous!\" or \"I'd like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:\n\n\"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"\n\nFYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!\n\nIf you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.\n\nTo those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:\n\n\"Devil's Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols\n\"The Essential Heart\" by Heart\n\"Highway To Hell\" by AC/DC\n\"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths\n\"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm\n\"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty\n\"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars\n\"Ugly\" by Life of Agony\n\"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads\n\nAs far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!\n\nI also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)", "label": 0}

The success of any hypnosis cd is based on the excellence of its script and the skill of its narrator.

Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) \"Haunted\", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing \"America\".\nOverall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is \"the first record I enjoy listening to\", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums.

Wanted to try the album since we got a new $600 Sony turntable that rips albums into DSD files.  This album was a big disappointment.  Comparing the mentioned song, the bottom end is just way tooooo fat!  No excuse!.  All the 5 star people might say this is a novice review and I would say that my Stones Emotional Rescue album sounds great on the same table.  Smooth, rich, very enjoyable to listen to, not fat and heavy.  The one mixing the track(s) for vinyl needs to adjust the dials from the digital format settings.  How would anyone know this album is not nearly what it could be from reading all of the 5 star reviews.  Too bad because this album was recorded very well!!

{"text": "Some nice arrangements in here and all of the guys are definitely powerful, skilled singers, but it's infrequent on this CD that you hear the group singing as that -- a group. I kept getting distracted by the distinctly different qualities of each voice poking through, battling one another even. There's not much blend or match between the voices here, particularly when they are really \"letting loose\" and cranking the chords. They each want to belt it out, and it sounds more like four different guys singing at the same time, than one group singing together.\n\nThe track that most consistently comes across with a unit sound, where the individuals meld into one sound, is the last track. That's really wonderful...until the spoken prayer comes in, which seems to take away from the emotion of the words & harmony of the song, doggone it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 \"Intuition\" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single \"Stand\" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider \"0304\" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...\n\"0304\" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of \"pieces of you\" or \"Spirit\", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.", "label": 2}

I realize discussing matters of taste can be a futile exercise, but compared with the rest of the Webb/Carmichael catalog, this album in my view falls below all except for Natural Elements.\n\nThe Alchemist - A bright and original tune, it's even better in duet. Carmichael and Gilderdale played it without the band at a show in 2001 and it really made me appreciate the song for what it is.\n\nJamaica Heartbeat - does nothing for me.\n\nGeorgia Peach - a truly warm and beautiful ballad. Well produced and well arranged.\n\nPlaying For Time - too long and repetitious, and the keyboard outro is annoying\n\nWhen The Lights Go Out - A good bit of romantic ballad, although the \"baseball organ\" solo, though well played, sounds entirely out of place here. Why not a kind of Fender Rhodes instead?\n\nClear Air For Miles - pleasant, if unremarkable\n\nFire Of The Heart - One of the stronger tracks on the album. AA is at its best when playing flamenco-ish stuff.\n\nFreeze Frame - The musical equivalent of painting a picture of grass growing, then looking at it while the paint dries. Only less captivating.\n\nOn The Case - Now we're getting somewhere! This is a fun little piece, and one of the few vigorous numbers on the CD.\n\nBreak For The Border - Another uptempo number; while it's competent and adequate, it's hardly one for the anthologies.\n\nApart from The Alchemist, Georgia Peach, and Fire of the Heart, there's not a lot of variety here.

If you want to find out for yourself,\nthen get the CD. You will not regret it! Prepare to be\nliterally blown away by the new, cool Jewel! You'll love\nit, I guarantee!\"\nI think the line, \"the new, cool Jewel\" sums up my point very well. I am unsure of Jewel's intentions with this album, but it is undoubtedly swaying listeners such as the above reviewer her direction. I must have not of received the memo that said we are now judging music on how \"cool\" someone is versus the overall quality of the music.\nI do feel this album is not up to par with her previous releases, but you have to give some credit where credit is due for at least attempting to make a pop album with some thought behind it. Most typical pop albums don't try to criticize the politics of the nation, or offer an analysis of the state of pop culture. For this reason alone I give it 3 stars, it sets a higher intellectual level for pop albums to hopefully try to live up to, but we all know they won't\nJust to offer an analysis of our behavior as reviewers, its funny to me that the reason some won't listen to jewel now is exactly why some people will listen. With respect to her earlier albums it would have been the same crowds but on opposite ends of the spectrum.\nI think a line from intuition sums it up well, \"in the world of post-modern fad, what was good now is bad\"", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a review for the 2016 remastered version. I give the music 5 stars. Hands down one of the best thrash albums ever. It's a classic. As for the new version, well if you don't own it already and want a hard copy then buy it (I'm a hard copy kind of guy. I'm not an audiophile by any means but I like collecting albums by my favorite bands. I use the iPod for the car and general convenience .) If you already only the physical copy then don't waste your money. I for one hate digi-pack CDs and the new version is a paper case where you have to slide the CD in and out which will scratch the disc. There's nothing new in the artwork or booklet either. Even the CD is the simple basic CD without any artwork or anything on it. As for the remastered sound, again I'm not an audiophile, but it does sound a little louder but nothing major. You still can't hear Cliff Burton's bass all that great. a remix would've been nice. A good idea for some of these bands that were recorded a long time ago is to offer the original album and a remixed version in the same set. I know Megadeth got a lot of crap for remixing and remastering their classic albums. Offer these classic albums in a two disc set. CD one could be the original and CD 2 could be here remixed remastered version. I would love to hear a remixed ride the lightning and a remixed and justice for all. But of course the original albums should stand as they are because that's how they were recorded. They have a bit of history behind them.  One of the most famous or infamous things about justice is the mixing and how crappy it was. I want the classic album but it would be pretty sweet to have it remixed as well. Not that a band like Metallica is going to give a flying crap one way or another I guarantee they do not read Amazon reviews, but if you already own the CD version with a jewel case of this album and the kill em all album I see no reason at all to re-buy the CD version. There is also no bonus tracks on the CD versions for that you have to fork  over 150 bucks for the box set with the vinyl as well. I only bought the remastered version for five bucks so it was worth it to see the difference. It's not worth replacing my old copy so I'll give it to someone who doesn't have it. Again the music is great. The upgraded product not so much. I give it a five for the music only and a 1 for the packaging", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'm a latecomer to Panheadom.  I picked up their self-titled as the final component of my five-strong Skillet collection, already well-versed in the sounds of Invincible, Alien Youth, and Hey You, I Love Your Soul.  The result was immediate suprise for me, and a monthlong vacation in my disc rack's nether regions for the unfortunate CD.\nDespite my first impression, Skillet's Forefront debut is actually quite good.  It sounds very little like any of the others.  This is from before the electronic sampling frenzy that gave Hey You it's distinctive edge.  Skillet was a novice threesome with a surprisingly tight sound, just beginning to pull together the musical chemistry that makes a band a band.\nThe music has more grunge in it than any of their subsequent work.  I Can, Beautiful Robe, Paint, and Promise Blender are tight, edgy guitar tunes, split up by a handful of more upbeat songs. The radio-friendly acoustic single Saturn (included ad infinitum on contemporary compilation albums) and the original worship song Safe With You provide counterpoint to their unpolished rock edge.  The penultimate song, Boundaries, opens with a distinctly un-Skillet guitar hook that sounds like it was ripped from a Lenny Kravitz CD before John's rasp takes us to the song's anthemic chorus.  Splinter closes the album on a peppy note.\nFor someone just getting into Skillet's music, I would advise starting with either Alien Youth or Hey You, I Love Your Soul before digging back down to their roots.  This record is less pulled-together than either of those CDs, though it certainly earns its place alongside (or just above) Invincible and Ardent Worship.  The awkwardness of certain filler tracks bumps the album down to a four, but it's a respectable early effort from a powerhouse of underappreciated alterna-rock.  Headbang with me.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Notwithstanding the hit-making assembly line of Nashville, country music will always bring me back to the idea of wandering, a sense of nomadic drift brought about by pain, heartbreak and loss. The tradition dates back nearly a century to the Carter Family, whose songs may sound dated but whose lyrics of leaving heartache to wander away from home and into the grave ring surprisingly true today. After all, our emotions and our natural reactions to them have stood the test of time, even as society has evolved tremendously since the Carter Family first laid down their music on wax.\n\nTo look at Lucinda Williams on the cover of West is to see a woman who has lived through enough pain for three people, as she turns her back on the world with a frustrated yet resigned sigh. The country singer/songwriter has spent the last year of her life wandering in the most literal sense, making a pilgrimage to Los Angeles in response to her mother's death and a turbulent relationship that likely ended with lots of tears and thrown kitchenware. Like it or not, Williams' first studio offering in four years is inspired by exactly those two things and little more. Suffice to say that West is a monumental downer--the starkest and bleakest album in a line of stark, bleak albums that began with Essence in 2001.\n\nIt's an approach that leaves West somewhat flat and one-dimensional when viewed from a distance, but for Williams, God is--and has always been--in the details. Far from being the instrumental knockout that was 1998's Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, West has the studio musicians wisely stepping back to plant the focus squarely on Williams, whose torchy, weathered voice can make even trite lyrics like \"The days ahead will never be the same / for you I would have changed my name\" quake with sorrow. \"Unsuffer Me,\" in which Williams prays for someone to relieve her of years of abuse, is downright painful to hear, not necessarily because of what she sings, but because she sings it in repetitive vocal droops that evoke consecutive blows to the head in slow motion. Quiet is the new loud here; the final track, \"West,\" is simultaneously simmering and shattering, making great use of empty space that mimics the void upon which she now gazes.\n\nWilliams remains the talented songwriter she's always been, but she's constrained a bit by the limitations of West's subject matter. There are only so many ways one can describe a breakup. \"Everything has changed / Everything has changed,\" she sings on \"Everything Has Changed.\" Well, yeah. Williams also has trouble pulling off anger in an album that has every right to be fraught with it. She only takes a few stabs, preferring instead to stay esconsed in her own gloomy universe, but all fall short. Consider \"Come On,\" the album's only bona-fide rocker, whose rough electric guitars, crashing drums and high-pitched violin fizzle when they should explode, and whose weak double entendres (\"You didn't even make me...come on!\") would elicit snickers from anyone who's ever heard Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville.\n\nWhile \"Come On\" has proven to be a consistent turkey in the eyes of the critics, the best song here, \"Words,\" has the misfortune of landing in the penultimate slot where it's guaranteed to be passed over. For a precious brief moment, \"Words\" switches things up; the song is about mustering strength, not accepting renunciation (\"My words enjoy the feel of the paper/ better than mingling with your consonants/ once they get going, they never waver/ and they slip in between your ifs, ands, and buts\"), and the guitars and drums percolate plaintively, even hopefully. But this isn't an uplifting album by any stretch of the imagination; it's a breakup record if ever there were one, a record for those down-in-the-mouth moments before you can even begin to think about taking the next step. Clearly, Williams isn't ready for that yet.\n\nAll of this prompts the question: Can we really fault her for churning out such an oppressively dreary record? Far be it from me to invalidate anyone's feelings, and Williams convinces us of her depressive state through the honesty of her lyrics and her sobering, somber arrangements. Yet, perhaps the album's release was a bit premature. Williams' best friend and worst enemy has always been her own staunch perfectionism; there might be a several-year gap between her albums, but until now, the wait has been entirely worth it. She took three full years just to record Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, but her adherence to the integrity of the final product made it one of country music's contemporary watersheds. Her Live at the Fillmore album in 2005 bought her enough time so that she could have waited one or two more years to release something, possibly during her reemergence from the doldrums. But now we have West, and a bummer is a bummer, especially for those who don't have the time, energy or desire to meet Williams halfway.", "label": 2}

Everything past these two tracks could have held my momentum for the duration, but it's just gone.\nIf The Bangles get a US distribution deal, they would be best served to lose these two tracks completely.

{"text": "After a rather mediocre first solo album in 1977, \"AOAD\" was the first in a series of commercially successful '80s records by Steve Winwood. Considering that he played all the instruments and did the production, \"AOAD\" is a remarkable effort, even if it's not miles away from the then-modern brand of synth-centered, danceable wave pop. It's a continuation of the introverted style found on Steve's first solo outing, with typically soulful vocals but more progressive studio technology and better developed melodies. Generally, some songs are among the best of Steve's solo work. \"While you..\" does an excellent job of creating a hopeful and uplifting atmosphere, just as the funny pop bubble of \"Second-hand woman\". The 8-minute \"Night train\" is more energetic and intricate, with its edgy rhythms and jagged guitars, it even sounds a bit like Talking Heads. Like other Winwood solo releases, \"AOAD\" isn't without some problems, though. This album hasn't enough great songs to support its ambitions, and it does never provide a knock-out punch like \"Valerie\" or \"One and only man\". The title cut, \"Slowdown sundown\", and \"Dust\" are fairly subdued soul-pop songs and, as such, are quite boring and forgettable. Lyrically, the album is strong, and although the words may seem a little awkward at times, they often contain intriguing takes on life and love. Overall, I think that \"AOAD\" could've been much greater if Steve had enlisted the help of his old Traffic fellows. Fans will still find plenty to like, but for those checking out Winwood for the first time, \"Chronicles\" or \"Back in..\" would be a wiser investment.", "label": 2}

She does a splendid job of mixing up her vocal sounds, sounding very reminiscent of Portishead on LEAVE YOUR LIGHTS ON and HAUNTED. At other times, she balances a very unique-sounding vocal range (At times sounding like Tori Amos mixed with the Cardigans) for the songs DOIN' FINE and STAND. The best song on this Cd is definitely (by a long shot) her first single, INTUITION. It has that fiery edge and very witty lyrics that Jewel desperately needs to reinvent herself.\n  However, this Cd does not deserve the 5 star rating because it lacks more eye-popping, edgy music. I almost fell asleep through the last 4 songs of this Cd! This Cd is definitely a good \"road trip\" cd, but if Jewel wants to show her political/edgy side, she needs a more intense sound than the songs on this Cd.

Unfortunately, she is almost ignored by many Fans and Journalists. Just read the reviews here. She is also a very versatile songwriter and each of her songs has a unique sound, yet she has a distinguishable style.\nThe Album itself is quite okay, but nothing special. It's certainly not as good as their older records, because there are some forgettable songs on it. \"The Rain Song\", \"Mixed Messages\" and even \"Here Right Now\" just sound the same, I couldn't tell them apart in the first 30 seconds, except for Debbi's and Vicki's voices. No other Bangles Record had so many songs without a specific \"personality,\" this one has three already, which is very sad.\nVicki Peterson was once a great songwriter and \"Stealing Rosemary\" proves she still is. The two Continental Drifters songs the Bangles covered are lukewarm at best and worse than the originals. What was her point in re-recording something if it isn't better or at least as good as the original? Vicki's \"Single by Choice\" is quite a good song.\nI always thought Debbi Peterson is an underrated songwriter, \"Here Right Now\" *was* excellent played live, but on this disc it is very bland and doesn't do much, it comes, goes, who cares. On \"Lost at Sea\" she shows off her great singing, but songwriting-wise it's very formulaic. Maybe, because it was co-written with Susannah Hoffs.\n\"Something That You Said\" is one of the worst songs the Bangles ever recorded. It just screams PLAY ME ON THE RADIO, and is completely compromised. With Big, Fat and Ugly Keyboards right from the start, sterile Drum-loops, it is a song that is recorded to sell records and shows no artistic vision whatsoever. Very alien and commercial. The whole song is almost a clich Bangle-song, the way an outsider would have written it for them to record. I'm amazed that two band members actually got a hand in the song writing.\n\"Song For A Good Son\" by Michael Steele is just genius, this Woman knows how to touch her listener's hearts. Whenever I listen to it, I find something new and interesting, a detail here, the ticking of a clock there, those screaming guitars in the background and more. She wrote that song on her own and that proves she is just an amazing artist. How sad that most Bangle Fans concentrate on Susannah Hoffs and ignore this great, talented  musician. Nickle Romeo and Between the Two are a bit less inventive but great nevertheless.\nSusannah's songs are all very boring, she sings an okay-cover version and the other songs are just ballads. While there is much noise about the cover song (written by Elvis Costello) it covers (pun intended) the fact that the Bangles haven't done much with their version. It's just a carbon-copy of the original, with a different sounding singer. That they even use the song title of a cover-tune for the title of the record says a lot about their current state of creativity.\nAll those Studio-musicians and silly toys like drum-loops are just a waste and didn't add anything to this record. Less would have been more.\nI gave that Album three Stars because Michael Steele's songs save it from an abysmal fall into the hell pit of failed comebacks...\nMy suggestion is: Buy this record for Michael's songs and give the rest a chance too, maybe you will like it. ... The Bangles are still a great band and deserve at least one try by the listener.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).", "label": 1}

{"text": "Usually, a Tracy Chapman song is urbane, in a quiet understated hip way, with a slice of wit. \"Talkin' Bout A Revolution\" is not that. Although it has become popular as an anthem in her concerts and covered by several artists, it is thin from start to finish.\n\nTrying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Wasting time in the unemployment lines\nSitting around waiting for a promotion.\"\n\nShe whispers \"It sounds like a whisper.\"\n\nAnd she fills in space by repeating \"Run Run Run Run...\"\n\nThe music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.\n\nTracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song.

Everyone bought into his underdog bid to take out Ja Rule and Murder Inc in 2003. Had he perfected his flow and taken rap music further in a positive direction, he would still have his fan base. Instead dude proved to be the biggest and worst gimmick in hip hop history by sticking to his formula of Beef & Bullets and biting Murder Inc. He's even dissed Dr. Dre who basically saved dude's life by signing him and Eminem. He's even starting to dis Em.

{"text": "I must confess that I have been so tuned-out by what passes for popular music these days that I had no idea that the Bangles had released a new album in 2003. The packaging contains a \"bonus\" DVD, so with that added incentive funds for the CD was added to my slim budget. I like to get one-on-one with the music rather simply engage it as atmosphere, so on went the headphones. Actually having to listen to the songs that way allows one to judge its tunefulness, and a dull song is easily identified.  The titles and lyrics of most of the songs suggested Alanis Morissette territory, but fortunately the playing and singing isn't mean-spirited enough to appeal to the revenge fantasy crowd.\n\n  Those hoping for a complete break from mind-numbing dullsville with a welcome blast from the past, however, will be somewhat disappointed. This is not the Bangles you remembered from the 80's. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to call this a Bangles' record at all--under-produced in a country rock sort of way, muted guitars and vocals on most of the tunes, and rarely exuberant. I guess this is what you call \"growth,\" but a lot of what was great in the past is still great for a reason.\n\n  The first three songs are stuck in the same groove, the kind you skip over to get to the good stuff, relatively speaking. Melody makes a welcome intrusion on the proceedings in \"Ask Me No Questions\" and from there the record is fairly listenable. The most obviously Sixties's influenced number, \"Nickel Romeo,\" is also easily the most interesting song here, a cross-pollination between psychedelia and Dylan (I guess). The beat picks up on \"Ride the Ride\" with its retro organ and chorus adding some musical variety. \"I Will Take Care of You\" sounds like a country ballad, but tough guitars  on \"Single By Choice\" lends the sentiment credibility. But only on \"Mixed Messages\" do the girls let it all hang out, with the playing and singing approximating their glory days. After all is said and done, the only song here that I would add to a compilation on an mp3 player is the finale, \"Grateful\" with its sweet lullaby effect that somehow makes the trip not a completely joyless experience. But, alas, the CD is copy-protected (bad move).\n\n  This is a two-star record I'm giving three, since this is, after all, the Bangles who at their best provided some memorable bits of popcraft in the Eighties; I'd take them over Madonna's self-absorbed posturing any day of the year. I would like to hear more from them, but for now, the title of The Essential Bangles compilation pretty much states all you need to know.", "label": 2}

On the flipside, this got the attention of Eminem and Dr Dre, who decided that 50 Cent was someone who they could work with. But 50 Cent is set to be this years most talked about rapper. And there are moments on Get Rich or Die Tryin' which show that this hype maybe be as much about music as mayhem. 50 Cent has a great flow, his rhymes wrapping themselves perfectly around booming Dre beats (Da Club for instance).

Skip to the year 2005, and The Massacre is released, I heard so many bad reviews of it so i thought i'd download it first to check it out, a wise decision.  I feared the worst after hearing the first two singles and I was right it was absolute c**p (see more in my massacre review).  It got me thinking, can Get Rich Or Die Tryin have been by the same person, I went back and listened to it again (listening to the lyrics as well now) and realised it was also pretty c**p.  O.K thats a little harsh, but it was nowhere near as good as i had remembered it, sure In Da Club still bangs when they play it in the club, as does P.I.M.P, but lyrically it has nothing of substance at all.  The beats are all that hold this album together, and they are good, but the further 50 moves away from Dre and Eminem I can see things getting even worse, and when the beats are gone, what do you have left?

This collection of songs does seem to reflect a wide variety of styles -- lots of Latin influences, a touch of gospel, R&B with a touch of urban, and plenty of adult contemporary.  His remake of Cindy Morgan's \"Love Can Break Your Fall\" demonstrates the best of Jody McBrayer -- a smooth, passionate vocal filled with conviction and emotion.  Frankly, he blew Cindy out of the water on this.  The rest of the album, while enjoyable, just didn't meet the same standard.  Lyrically, many of the songs are strong and speak of pain, redemption, and joy in the love of Christ.  Something just seems to be missing -- I wonder what this debut would have been like if he had gone back to the drawing board one more time (for lack of a better term).\nI do hope that his second solo release will really reflect the statement he wishes to make as a solo artist.

Lemme break it down for you. let's talk about MJ's past greatest hits albums, History, Number Ones, and the Ultimate Collections. History and Number Ones all contain almost the same songs. Except for a few noticeable ones, they both contain well known hits by the king of pop. History contained the old hits by Michael jackson whereas Number Ones contained material spanning from Off the wall to invincible. Great songs, two great compilations. The Ultimate Collection was indeed, the ULTIMATE michael jackson collection. It featured songs from the king of pop from his early days with the Jackson 5, all the way to the present. It contains a few new tracks that were never released until the ultimate collection, as well as never before heard verions of songs such as \"we are the world\" and \"pretty young thing\". it also contains a LIVE CONCERT (Dangerous Tour Live in Bucharest). To me, (since  i'm a hardcore michael jackson fan), this was the most wonderful Michael Jackson compilation ever made. However, there are people out there who do not want to spend big money on this (it is quite costly). The ESSENTIALS is a 2-disc compilation. The first disc contains Material from the King of Pop that spans from his Jackson 5 days to Thriller. Great hits on this first cd are, \"i want u back\", \"abc\", \"don't stop til u get enough\", \"rock with you\" and many MANY more! The second disc contains material from Bad to Invincible. hits such as \"bad\", \"man in the mirror\", \"the way you make me feel\", \"heal the world\" are in this second half of this compilation. if you ask me, this album should be called \"History\" because it is a great way to have all of his well known classics all in one album. why pay over $70 for the ultimate collection? why pay over $15 for a greatest hits album that is so similair to the other (History and Number Ones) when you can have the Essentials for around the same price? The name of the album itself speaks for itself. This is indeed, the essential michael jackson collection.", "label": 1}
{"text": "When my copy of MJ's Number Ones got scratched last summer, I almost bought a new copy. But then a friend of mine suggested I get the Essential MJ instead. I'm glad I listened to her. Both collections are great, but the Essential MJ is MUCH more complete. Unlike the Number Ones collection, the Essential MJ includes several hits from the Jackson 5/Jacksons as well as MJ's early solo hits Ben, Rockin Robin, and Gotta Be There. It also includes all the top 10 charting songs from Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad.\n\nMy friend was lucky and somehow got a 3-disc version of the Essential MJ, with the 3rd disc including Scream and Say Say Say. I ordered the 2-disc version from Amazon and then downloaded several other MJ songs (\"I'll be There,\" \"Never Can Say Good-Bye,\" \"Who's Loving You?\" \"I Wanna Be Where you Are,\" and \"Dancin' Machine\" from his early work, and \"Workin Day and Night,\" \"Say, Say, Say,\" \"Scream,\" and \"The Earth Song\" from his work as an adult solo artist).

Clue one-No cymbals on the drums..why? because they would have no sustain sped up and sound like hitting alimunum foil. Clue 2-thier guitars would need 30 plus frets to hit some of those notes in the solo...Yes I know what harmonics are...and they are used..but if you listen close...you can tell.clue 3-the drum sounds are very high pitched with ZERO sustain..which would be caused by being sped up.

{"text": "Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.\n\nThis version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and \"Fade To Black\" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade.", "label": 2}

True hip hop heads know this is fake, most people I know like Pop Rap cause they probably haven't heard better.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is his voice, it's damn annoying, he ain't got any skills either, his lyrics are sh*t too.

Your musical tastes are fine with me, but reviewing an album with a metal fan perspective makes your reviews sound ridiculous. The fact that one hip-hop artist has been shot more than the next one is irrelevant to the music. Besides, focusing on commercial artists such as Puff Daddy in order to compare to 50 Cent proves that you do not have enough knowledge about hip-hop artists in the underground to feel as though you know the genere's basic content and music. KRS-One, The Roots, Cannibal Ox, Talib Kweli, GZA, many more you don't know of. Sinister, the dramatic impersonation of a rap fan is unacceptable. Especially when it sounds more like Limp Bizkit than anything. Jazz, in order to review this album, you need to acutally listen with an open mind. Until you have done that, you have no right to make any comment (positive or negitive) about \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\". Of course, rap may not be your type of music (which you have already proven), so with that, I do not recommend this to fans of metal.\n50 Cent is not a good rapper, in fact, his lyrics are some of the most godawful stuff I've ever heard. It's the production that carries this album, and the guest appearences as well. That sums up the album.\nI will repeat myself, if you are primarily a metalhead, you are not going to like this. If you are one of these metalheads, have listened to \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" with an open-mind, then you have the right to make any opinion you want about it. But don't waste your time writing unresearched garbage.\nIf you like this album, I would also recommend Mase's \"Double Up\", Fabolous's \"Ghetto Fabolous\" and (for more healthy listening) KRS-One's \"The Sneak Attack\".\nOverall: 3 stars", "label": 2}

Wonderful themes about various aspects of the big city. It came out around 1961 on MGM. and was called The City. You'll never find it. Under Larry Elgart's name.

The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979.

Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released.

This guy is NOT the next Tupac, although he may be the next Ja Rule or DMX.\nSomeone said that if you like The Roots, you probably won't like this CD, and I have to agree.  If you like Eminem's new stuff (not his old, Slim Shady stuff.  They are completely different, as Slim Shady was FAR superior to the current, no punchline dropping, Em), or DMX or 50's underground tracks, you will probably like this CD.

{"text": "I am no doubt a big Eminem fan---I happen to own all of his albums. But I really think that the producers should've refrained from releasing \"clean\" versions of the album mainly because the songs lose its great rhythm. We all know that his lyrics are laden with unprintable expletives all over. So, expectedly, every other word is censored, and having all those short silent spaces or blurred sounds in between words are just so distracting and enough to give the listener a big headache.\nAlso, some of Enimen's witty humor is lost in the clean version. Perfect cases in point are that of \"My Name Is\" and \"Guilty Conscience.\" Try to listen both to the explicit and the clean versions and you'll know what I mean.\nIf you're thinking of buying the Slim Shady LP, just buy the explicit version instead. If you're too young and impressionable to buy it, then I suggest that you wait a few years until you're old enough. Enimen talks about pretty heavy stuff on the realities of life in his own unique and well, \"un-mainstream\" way, which definitely requires a very mature and critical way of thinking.", "label": 0}

A disastrous debut of the band that was, for sure, the  continuation of the Beatles' story and style.\nBut it's not bad as they  say. Take, for example, \"Some People Never Know\". Paul was deeply  in love with Linda, and all the love songs he was composing since 1967 were  for her. With no Lennon around to do the compose-competition, he wrote and  sang with his heart, no matter the style, the challenge or the star-rating  the critics put on it. Another extraordinary love song,  \"Tomorrow\", was a hit cover of the peruvian rock band We All  Together, they based their style entirely of this album's, and they  succeed. \"Wild Life\", I think, was a Linda's idea. Attacks the  human behaviour comparing it like beasts; but -unlike the siberian tigers  and the rhinos- not close to the extintion, so they are very dangerous to  the peaceful people, like the album cover shows.\nAn interesting McAlbum,  not as good as the masterpiece \"Tug Of War\", but absolutely  better that \"Press To Play\"", "label": 2}

It has some forgettable tracks and a few standouts, Blasphemous Rumours being perhaps the best (and it's neither \"nihilistic\" nor an \"eye-roller\"). Overall, not quite a \"great\" album, but worth getting if you've already got and like the three albums following (Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, Violator), when they hit their peak.\n\nMy real reason for writing this, though, is to object to Beth Bessmer's inane review, which tells us nothing except that the author has no idea what she's talking about. DM have certainly been guilty of some crap songwriting on occasion, but Blasphemous Rumours is well-written and sharply ironic, and there's nothing \"arbitrary\" about them targeting religion, it's a recurring theme in their work.

Fortunately their flagrant unoriginality alone gives me fodder enough for a satisfactory review. Let me first say that I don't expect every musical effort put forth in this world to be original. We all know there is nothing new under the sun, and in the quest to be original, many artists simply end up alienating all audiences. So I grant that every band today must borrow some from previous groups. However, if you are going to copy somebody at least copy somebody good. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Sum 41 must be charter members of the Blink 182 fan club. Blink 182 (despite what your 17 year old daughter might say) is not good, and this is why I can't understand Sum 41. Why do they insist on copying bad music? There is a reason there are no Fine Young Cannibals cover bands out there. Bad music is not to be imitated! Now, as for the song \"Fat Lip,\" the first time I heard it, I didn't know whether the lyrics were sincere or sarcastic. Apparently they are for real. Look at the lyrics. It's like they read a book entitled \"How to Write Punk Lyrics,\" before etching out this one. They covered all the bases: Conformity, society, falling in line- you know, all the hits. Memo to Sum 41. The punk revolution already happened and YOU WEREN'T THERE! And the ultimate irony is that in their quest to combat conformity, they in fact fall right in line alongside Blink 182, as mainstream as you can get.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I agree with the negative critics of this movie. And no, I'm not a follower of that late, cultish wacko Ayn Rand. I just don't think the movie is good enough.\n\nIt's not a *bad* movie either, but to people new to Rand and her movement, it comes across as relatively incomprehensible. You don't get a real feel for her ideas, her novels, or her background. Perhaps I feel this way because I live in Sweden, where Rand is almost unknown (even I was initially confused by the movie, and I know more about her than the average Svensson).\n\nMaybe Americans, who know some of the background, can look differently at \"The Passion of Ayn Rand\"? Of course, the actors are brilliant, but that's another show.\n\nPersonally, I call the movie \"The nude body of Helen Mirren\". LOL! The sex is very explicit. Apparently, Barbara Brandon (who wrote the book the movie is based on) was somewhat disappointed by the sheer number of sex scenes. But I guess it's difficult to make a movie about Rand without a lot of sex, since her love life was notoriously messy, and also affected the leadership of her movement. Prudish viewers, you have been warned.\n\nAll things considered, I give this movie three stars. It deserves more in terms of acting, but overall, I don't think \"The Passion of Ayn Rand\" is the best production around.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As a die-hard fan, my level of anticipation for this album was high and my feelings can be summed up this way:\n\n\"I waited fifteen years for THIS?!?!?\"\n\nI've been a fan since the 80's, but my love of the music goes right back to day one.  Not liking this album as much as others has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with when you started listening to Chicago.\n\nIf I could have given it 2.5 stars, I would have.  The production values are slick and there are some great harmonies in the vocal arrangements and the horn arrangements are great, but it kind of ends there for me.  There are a few decent tracks--Feel (w/Horns), Caroline, Already Gone, Better--but the rest leaves me kind of...well...underwhelmed. If you're a casual fan, the album probably won't disappoint you at all.  If you're a long-time fan and have been for decades, you'll likely want something more.\n\nHonestly, I liked the unreleased \"Stone of Sisyphus\" album much better.  It's a shame it never saw the light of the retail sales floor.\n\nI've tried listening to this album on random and it gets a little better with a different track order.  Jay DeMarcus putting a block of ballads up front really kind of kills the pace of the album, I think.  Chicago has never wanted to be known as \"the ballad band,\" yet here we are on Chicago XXX with all the ballads stacked on top.  Odd.\n\nHere is the track order I've been using that makes me like the album a bit more:\n\n3.  Caroline\n11. Lovin' Chains\n2.  King of Might Have Been\n13. Feel (w/Horns)\n8.  Where Were You?\n6.  Long Lost Friend\n7.  90 Degrees And Freezing\n4.  Why Can't We? (with Shelly Fairchild)\n9.  Already Gone\n10. Come To Me, Do\n5.  Love Will Come Back (with Rascal Flatts)\n12. Better\n1.  Feel (Hot Single Mix)\n\nI also think DeMarcus concentrated a little too much on the vocal mix.  Granted, that has been a staple of Rascal Flatts (his band), but the horns seem to take a definite back seat on several songs, instead of being a kind of \"fourth vocal.\"\n\nThe other key failing of the album is this: there are NO songs by Jimmy Pankow on the disc.  None.  Pankow is one of the best writers in the band and, after fifteen years, he doesn't have one composition on this disc.  That's a bummer for long-time fans, I think.\n\nGuys, please don't let there be 15 years between original albums again.  There are only so many greatest hits packages and retrospectives a fan can take.", "label": 2}

{"text": "With their lyrics about teen alienation set to loud guitar chords and fast-paced drum rhythms, and general appearance of scruffy t-shirts, bleached hair and piercings, Canadian quartet Sum 41 are very such a marketing man's dream. Best thought of as Green Day style punk-pop with influences from Iron Maiden and the Beastie Boys thrown in, this stuff has found a big audience over the years.\nFrom hearing their hit single Fat Lip, its not hard to tell why. The guitar chord is impressive if not ultra-skilful, the lyrics about their misspent youth will be meaningful, and the chorus is cathcy.\nUnfortuantely, this is the best thing on offer. The album is mostly quite generic, with little to distinguish it from 100 other bands. I guess that's typical, when a few bands hit a winning formula, a lot of chancers copy it. All She's Got is one of the bettter tracks here, sounding like one of the best Offspring songs The Offspring didn't write. Second single In Too Deep is very much more pop than punk, with all but the chorus being fairly mellow, showing potential for development once maturity sets in.\nAs many reviewers have said, tis a shame to see this corporate cloned music and image cited as 'punk'. Punk is about fighting the system and changing things through inspiration and vigour - something a lot of these guys could learn from. Lesser-known bands like No Use For A Name, Saves the Day, Alkaline Trio, NOFX and Pitchshifter would be much better to check out.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The movie is finally out. It is a fair representation of the life of this horse and the people involved with it. The film is very good but not great. I would be very suprised if it won any major Oscars. Its just not in that class. It gives the viewer a \"representation\" of the story. And yet, the filmmakers played hard and fast with the facts or just omitted things. They never brought in Pollard's wife to whom he was married to for 40 years. Also, Pollard became and alcholic because of the pain he had to endure from his falls. The Santa Anita Handicap shown at the end did not happen that way. Seabiscuit did not come from behind to win. He was second all the way and then finally won. Seabiscuit was scratched from an initial match with War Admiral only to have raced against the Triple Crown winner later. There are other things like this.\nIt is being billed as a story about three men and a horse that were down and out in one way or another and overcame adversity in a grand way. That is the drama behind the story. This drama coupled with the PBS-like documentary references make the film worth seeing.\nThe Randy Newman soundtrack compliments the film well but is not his best work.

{"text": "\"A Single Man\" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.\n\n\"Return to Paradise\" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, \"Georgia\" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up \"Tumbleweed Connection\". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs \"Madness\", \"Reverie\" and \"Song for Guy\", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; \"Madness\" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; \"Reverie\" is brief but effective, and \"Song for Guy\" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.\n\nThe other songs aren't bad. \"I don't care\" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. \"Part-time love\" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25", "label": 0}

{"text": "Soilwork. If you'd mentioned the name to me around 5 years ago, I would have raised the mighty metal horns symbol in respect. \"Chainheart Machine\" blew my head off in a way no album had managed for quite some time. It was truly breathtaking in so many ways. But that was last millennium! The Soilwork of today is a different beast altogether.\n\nNow before I go on, I have something to get out of my system. Personally, there's nothing I hate more than bands being hammered for changing style or trying to reach a greater audience. Bands like \"In Flames\", \"Paradise Lost\", \"Fear Factory\" and even \"Dimmu Borgir\" have been verbally murdered by fans that can't come to grips with the fact that a band wouldn't want to sound exactly the same for 15 years straight. Each of the above-mentioned bands have gone completely different directions to each other, but they've all come under some extreme criticism at some point for simply trying to sell more albums and reach a different audience. My thoughts on the matter are GET OVER IT. These guys play music for a living. If their not satisfied with their current style, they have every right to change things up, experiment and damn it, make some money out of their career. You won't find me giving an album 50% just because it doesn't sound anything like the last one. If I really enjoy the album, I'll give it what it deserves.\n\nThis brings me to \"Stabbing the Drama\". Soilwork have made an obvious attempt to be financially successful over the last few years, and from what I've read, they've become quite huge around the globe. They have nowhere near the technical aspects or aggression in their early albums that they had in the late 90s, but I've still enjoyed their output moderately since then. For those wondering, Soilwork are still definitely a metal band, and in fact are still quite heavy at times. So if \"Stabbing the Drama\" was really good, I'd have no problem praising it. But it's not! The album has its moments that getting me nodding in approval, but there are just too many tracks that go by without ever stamping any sort of authority. Throwing a few standard riffs together, with some tight but uninteresting drumming, and chucking in a cleanly sung chorus does not automatically make a good track.\n\nI just get the feeling that either Soilwork have become a bit lazy over the years, willing to take a template and run with it for an entire album, or that they simply put out too many albums in too short a time. I mean, the band have released 6 full length albums in the time most bands would release 3. Add to that the bands heavy touring load and they just haven't had enough time to create enough quality original music to keep churning out albums every year.\n\nSoilwork always create tight crunching albums with good production values, but until they go back to writing interesting creative music, they're not going to get the sort of praise that we all know they are capable of. At least, not from me.", "label": 2}

With this album you pretty much get the same deal except that the songs are a bit more mellow than that of the Rainbow lineup with Turner from 1981-1984. If you like good melodic hard rock than this is what you need. Most people who like the 80's will love this.\n\n1. Losing You(8/10)Good opener. Sounds like a cut from Rainbow's Bent out of Shape album!\n\n2. Young Hearts(7/10)Good track with the usual chorus line that screams the 80's sound!\n\n3. Endlessly(10/10)One of the best ballads ever! This song is really great. This is how a love song is done the right way. The guitar sounds really good on this track.\n\n4. Rescue You(5/10)I didn't like this one too much. A bit too much pop and not enough guitar.\n\n5. Feel the Fire(6/10)Not bad. A bit too weak sounding I thought.\n\n6. Get Tough(6/10)the guitars sound better on this track.\n\n7. Eyes of Love(8/10)This song sounds great. Another 80's classic.\n\n8. On the Run(10/10)Sounds like a cut from a Rainbow album once again. I enjoyed this one. Fans of Rainbow will love this one!\n\n9. Soul Searcher(8/10)Good tune this one is.\n\n10. The Race is On(8/10)A good rocker this one is.\n\nOverall I say if your just starting out to buy some good 80's albums, then this is a good start.

{"text": "For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.\nThe 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.\nIt is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next true Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I am quite new to the ranks of Gaither fans. I have never been a big fan of Gaithers; so many of their songs seem trite and sappy when you look at them on paper. But as I had recently acquired their CD \"Everything Good\" more or less accidentally, and loved the one a capella selection on that CD (the inspiring O Love That Will Not Let Me Go), decided to pick up a whole CD of their a capella songs.\nWhat I found completely fulfilled my highest hopes. The group is the current (2004) Gaither band, which is excellent. The relatively recent introduction of David Phelps (tenor) and Russ Taff (baritone) was a great move. Both of them have fantastic voices, and Phelps' arranging talents are highlighted on this CD.\nThe CD starts out with two songs in what you might call \"street corner style\" - how you might expect an a capella quartet on the street corner to sing (though, of course, incomparably better than most street corner singers). \"Low Down the Chariot\" is an intentional tribute to the Jordanaires. Leave It There/What a Friend We Have in Jesus is somewhat similar, although What a Friend starts to move into the next style.\nThis \"next style\" is best exemplified by \"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross.\" Here is a perfect example of the group doing an old hymn but showing off the a capella arrangement style of David Phelps. If you know \"O Love\" from \"Everything Good,\" you know what I mean. Absolutely spine-tingling.\nThey then move into more of a barbershop style. \"Delivered from the Hands of Pharaoh\" is an upbeat, close harmony style that sounds like it's as much fun to sing as to listen to. The later song \"Heaven's Joy Awaits\" is similar, and both thoroughly enjoyable.\n\"He Will Carry You\" is a baritone lead (featuring Russ Taff) song that reminds me of a cross between street corner 50s do-wop, and (in places) Gregorian Chant.\n\"Jesus! What a Friend for Sinners,\" of course, is another old hymn, but one done in a different style, as a lead plus drone accompaniment. The later song \"I Then Shall Live\" is done in the same style. I didn't like this as much as the other hymn style at first, but it's growing on me.\n\"Sing a Song/I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\" is a throwback to the early 70s and done in a \"Coke commercial on the hill\" style (though, again, much better than the old Coke commercial). It's a fun little medley.\n\"Center of My Joy\" and \"Gentle Shepherd\" are two Gloria Gaither songs that (as I mentioned) I had previously dismissed as trite and sappy. Whether it would be such in another setting or not, in this setting (sung by committed Christians, and in this beautiful and peaceful arrangement) they're beautiful.\nWith \"God Bless America,\" they again shift styles. I don't know how to describe the style, but if you can imagine a quartet of Michael Feinsteins (well known Gershwin singer), that comes close. In addition to the chorus, they sing the verse of this great old song, which I really appreciate. If you like songs of the 30s and 40s, you'll love it.\n\"I Then Shall Live\" is another kind of Gaither song I had previously dismissed - Gloria Gaither (I thought at the time) picking up somebody else's melody and recycling it; in this case, the melody from the hymn \"Be Still, My Soul\" (from Sibelius's \"Finlandia\"). Be that as it may, this is a beautiful arrangement that matches the grandeur of the original.", "label": 1}

As a result, the track is loud to the point of being distorted whenever the vocals or instruments peak - especially when Dino Valenti sings the more urgent vocals toward the end of the song.

I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about these songs that isn't as memorable or catchy. If you're already familiar with Soilwork's sound, there's nothing here that's going to surprise you. Maybe that's the problem - they've had the exact same sound and songwriting style for the last three albums, and they really don't seem too interested in changing anything about it. I don't know if it's a lack of ambition or fear of alienating their fans by experimenting with something a little bit different, but they just aren't progressing - they're treading water. Not helping matters is the way the clean vocals have become so repetitive, with nearly every vocal line reminiscent of something off Figure Number Five or Natural Born Chaos. The only minor change is that their new drummer is faster and more aggressive, incorporating more blast beats and double bass than previous albums contained. But that alone isn't enough to differentiate it from their other work since A Predator's Portrait - I expect more from one of the best melodic death metal bands around. If you're already a Soilwork fan and you just want to hear some new material, it's a solid enough release, but because it's so similar to the last two albums I found that it gets old quick.", "label": 2}

I know this was their biggest hit, but it was also the death knell and career killer for this band. I'm not going to speak for all long time 38 Special fans, but personally this song sickens me. It's schmaltzy and embarrassing, I cringe every time I hear it. Which is usually when I'm in line at CVS.  I know I'm not going to get much support here because I believe most 38 Special fans wouldn't even bother clicking on this song title.

I think the lyrics are really lacking, and I think lyrics are the most important part of the CD.  If you want to download a couple good songs, try The Best of Me, Almost There Going Nowhere, Decisions Decisions, and Left Coast Envy.", "label": 0}

{"text": "one thing that i have always enjoyed about soilwork is their riff complexity.  whether it be the melodeth syncopated thirds riffs of steelbath, the thrashier speed riffs of chainheart, or the powergroove chugs of predator's portrait, soilwork has always done an excellent job in including a variety of rhythmic punctuations between riffs and a variety of different picking and chording techniques between or even within riffs.  take the first minute or two of bastard chain as a perfect example.  harmonized octaves sliding into a groove riff with a harmonized sweep at the end.  beautiful!  the drums always blew me away with their attention to detail.  too often the role of the drummer in a melodic death metal (not so much gothenburg, however) is underemphasized, but he/she has full control of the momentum of the song and i love it when drummers approach the same riff with different types of beats, thereby actually exploring the possibility of sounds.  a good example of soilwork doing this is the prechorus of grand failure at 57 seconds.  i'm also a big fan of how soilwork used key changes to make the solos more expressive and frankly, interesting.  some nice thirds harmonization (which they never used) weaving in and out of wichers' incredible playing.  in sbs and chm i loved speed's fast-attack vocals, as they fit the tempos well.  enter predator's portrait... the clean vox come in.  now, i'm all for variety and clean vocals often make a song that much more interesting, but strid's choruses on that album were a bit more over the top than i had expected.  i think they pulled it of with predator's portrait, but i could hear the foreshadowing in his voice.  these choruses, which i always considered a brief cigarette break between the crushing riffs and melodies, would soon become the focus of the band.\n\nskip ahead a couple albums: enter figure number five.  remember all that stuff i said about variety and attention to detail?  not here.  not a bit.  every song just seems to be full of filler riffs for the purpose of feeding into an overdone chorus.  usually i don't think that solos are required to make a song great, and even though they were often incredible, old soilwork could have still stood their own without them.  the riffs in this album are so homogenous and mundane that i looked to solos to at least salvage the album and remind me that this was still soilwork.  the few solos that you'll find certainly did not do the job.  everything just seems to be a bed of lettuce upon which to place the overdone vocals.  seriously, the chording underneath and the notes that strid tries to hit make me turn red with embarrassment.  they all sound like something you would hear from linkin park.  i can't get over that...\n\nall this being said, i gave the album three stars because it's two points for being a metal band, one point for the few catchy riffs that i admit i became a sucker for (stabbing the drama and nerve intros).", "label": 2}

{"text": "Steve Winwood had been experiencing a feeling of frustration with his self-titled debut in 1977--basically, he was disheartened by contractural obligations, feeling that making the album was too much for the record company and not enough for his own enjoyment/ satisfaction.  With \"Arc of a Diver\", originally released on the last day of 1980, Winwood wanted to turn things around--he made the album entirely at his own pace, and he wanted it to be something of a rebirth for him.  He played all the instruments on the album himself, and he also handled all the producing and engineering chores.  The one musical area where Steve did get assistance is songwriting--every track is written by Winwood with a co-writer.  For a majority of the tracks, the co-writer is Will Jennings who would remain Winwood's primary writing collaborator for all of his albums through 1990's \"Refugees of the Heart\".  The opening song here is the big hit \"While You See A Chance\"--it's a perfectly good song with a strong melody, but the sugariness keeps it from being truly transcendant--that said, this song immediately establishes the Winwood/ Jennings \"feel-good formula\" that would yield huge commercial success later on in the decade (i.e. \"Higher Love\", \"Roll With It\", etc.).\n\nOverall, \"Arc of a Diver\" is a frustrating missed opportunity.  It seems Winwood was trying to \"update\" his sound by going really heavy on synthesizers and electronic percussion.  Problem is, on several tracks the synths are used to really lousy effect.  The title track, co-written by Vivian Stanshall, is a strong composition, very catchy and melodically crafty, but the blaring, grating synth takes away from its impact.  There's also dreary synth on the corny, somewhat aimless uptempo tune \"Second-Hand Woman\"--it gives you a \"what the heck is this?\" feeling the second it starts.  And the wavery synth is really headache-inducing on the album-closing ballad \"Dust\"--it seems he was trying to simulate an orchestra/ string section; he'd have been way better off just sticking to a real piano.  He goes easy on the synths--'plays it straight', if you will--on \"Slowdown Sundown\" which features acoustic guitar, piano, organ, and even mandolin, but unfortunately the tune itself is rather dull and sluggish.  \"Night Train\" goes for edginess, but it's hollow and rambles on much too long, although it does totally point the way to the far superior title track from \"Talking Back To the Night\".  Winwood does hit the mark big time though with the wonderfully melodic, intricately-arranged \"Spanish Dancer\", co-written by Jennings--on this track, the combination of synths, dreamy lyrics, & Winwood's smooth, soaring vocals result in a terrific, ethereal track.\n\nYou get a sense of Winwood just \"going for broke\" with this album, hoping that the then-modern production values would catch people's ears; apparently, it worked, since this was reportedly a major critical success, as well as a big hit commercially with the \"While You See A Chance\" single obviously having a key impact on the latter.  Trouble is, with much of the new-ness that got people's attentions at the time having been in poor taste, the album ends up being quite dated, a word I generally hate to use since I feel it gets thrown around a lot and is often misused, but it's fair to use it here.  Still, there is some really good music on \"Arc of a Diver\"--it's easy to wish more of it could be of the same caliber as \"Spanish Dancer\", a great piece of songwriting and a brilliant song that balanced the technology with tastefulness and imagination.", "label": 2}

{"text": "(Two and a half stars)  In 1993, Sarah McLachlan released \"Fumbling Toward Ecstacy\", an unqualified success musically, lyrically, and commercially.  The album won an audience of millions with its beautiful arrangements woven around deeply moving lyrics and melodies.  However, in the ten years between the release of \"Fumbling\" and the new album, \"Afterglow\", Sarah released only one album of new studio material (Surfacing).  This suggests a period drier than the Sahara (creatively) for Sarah who also released an acoustic album of previously released material, an album of B-Sides, a live album, two live videos, and a re-mix album in that same ten year time span.  The release of Afterglow confirms the suspicion Sarah may have peaked in 1993 at a very young age.  The material on Afterglow is(barely) saved only by the warmth of her voice.  The music is uninspired and bereft of the originality, passion and spark that made Solace and Fumbling Towards Ecstacy so endearing.  Apart from the opening and closing tracks, Fallen and Dirty Little Secret, Afterglow runs together like forty minutes on your local of Lite-rock music station.  The melodies are forgettable and performance is lacklustre.  It's too bad.  Of all the successful Canadian female music artists (Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Alanis Morrissette, Diana Krall), Sarah McLachlan is easily the most talented and sincere.  I hope that an artist doesn't have to suffer for his/her art, because Sarah certainly deserves the personal fulfillment that she seems to have obtained.  Regretfully, however, history would probably have been better served if Sarah refrained from recording anything new until she had something to say.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Hooray!  Chicago has released a full-length album of new material, their first in fifteen years!\n\nThat's the good news.  The bad?  Well, there's the fact that this group album sounds more like pieces of solo albums spliced together.  Where in the past each contributing songwriter and vocalist added his own touches to something that basically sounded like Chicago, here it's the opposite -- there are little attempts to add Chicago-like touches to what sound like Jason Scheff and Bill Champlin solo efforts.\n\nThis release is also lacking in, to quote a Lamm album title, \"subtlety & passion\".  Perhaps that's the fault of producer Jay DeMarcus, he of country-pop trio Rascal Flatts fame.  In place of subtlety we have pauses of total silence followed by pseudo-dramatic full-volume blasts of sound.  Doing that once, maybe twice, might be refreshing, but this album's full of those moments.  And that matches many of the lyrics, which spell out in blunt, redundant detail just how miserable/sad/optimistic/glad the singer is.  As for passion -- there's plenty of overwrought emotion attempting to pass itself off as passion, but the only track exhibiting any real passion is Lamm's \"Come To Me, Do\".  Perhaps that make sense.\n\nThere are also some really disturbing questions that come up as soon as you read the notes, such as:\n\nWhy does James Pankow, one of the band's best and most prolific songwriters, have *no* songwriting credits, not even a partial one?\n\nWhy does a band that has always prided itself on the musical \"chops\" of its member, for its first release of new music since 1991 employ *six* guest guitarists, *two* guest keyboard players, *two* guest drummers, and even a guest horn player?\n\nHow does a band that, in song:\n\n...railed long and bitterly against the Vietnam War;\n\n...publicly condemned Richard Nixon at the height of his popularity;\n\n...longed for the return of Harry Truman-like honesty in the White House;\n\n...more recently sang about the destruction of our environment (\"dear Mother Earth is dying away\");\n\n...and *always* complained about the apathy of the general public (think \"Dialogue\"),\n\nnow ignore the political and social issues of a very troubled and turbulent time similar to that of the band's early years, to write bland pap such as \"...all she ever needed, was the chance to be completed...\"?\n\n(Gag.)\n\nAnyway, the songs on XXX split naturally into several groups:\n\nThere's the useless and/or cringe-inducing:\n\nKing Of Might Have Been -- a.k.a. Jason Scheff recycles \"Hard Habit To Break\" without any of the musical or lyrical features that made the earlier song a hit.  This one features the \"completed\" lyric along with a number of other cliched, whiny, and wimpy expressions of love lost.\n\nLove Will Come Back -- Jason comes back to write the embarrassing lyric \"fill in the cracks\" and actually gets producer Jay DeMarcus to enlist his bandmates in Rascal Flatts to sing that line.  (With a straight face?)  This is the optimistic/positive companion to \"King...\"  (And what songwriter in his right mind would start a ballad with the words, \"I don't love you any more...\"?  Can you just see someone saying to their S.O., \"Honey, listen to this great Chicago song...\" only to have *that* be the first thing they hear?)\n\nLong Lost Friend -- Jason again, this time with such original lines as \"every single breath you take, you take with me\" and \"you came into my life and put all the pieces into place\" (how *does* he come up with this stuff?)\n\nWhy Can't We -- Bill Champlin's unnecessary duet with someone most Chicago fans probably couldn't identify if she smacked them in the head with her one-and-only country album.  Bill should be ashamed of soiling the theme of a great old Chicago hit by singing \"...we can get stronger every day\" towards the end of this one.\n\nFeel (Hot Single Mix) -- This version just simply doesn't need to exist, ever, anywhere near a Chicago album.  No horns?  What the **** were they thinking?\n\nThen there's the marginally passable:\n\nLovin' Chains -- One of two songs on XXX (three if you count \"Feel\" twice) that credits no band members as writers, this song might have had some promise if the lyrics didn't resort to the same helpless-poor-wimpy-loser theme that is otherwise Jason Scheff's forte.\n\nAlready Gone -- Normally a Bill Champlin composition would rank higher, but this one's too long and the chorus (\"check please, Louise/thank you very... NEXT\") looks much better on paper than when Bill sings it, running \"very\" and \"next\" together so you can't figure out what the heck he's singing.  His fake bluesman/soul man act is wearing a bit thin, a la P. C. Moblee.\n\nAnd these have some redeeming qualities:\n\nCaroline -- Proof that Jason Scheff can write catchy, upbeat songs, even if the lyrics are a bit sophomoric and not especially original.  The chorus is catchy enough to make this somewhat likeable.\n\nWhere Were You -- Another catchy tune, revisiting the old territory of \"it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along.\"  Again, the chorus makes this one.\n\n90 Degrees And Freezing -- If you ignore the title and stop thinking that there just had to be better word choices than \"pretty\" (\"why am I the only one who's cold on such a pretty day\"), this one's almost like an old-time Chicago tune, run through the inevitable Jason-filter.\n\nBetter -- Begs the question \"does Bill Champlin save his best material for his solo albums?\"  Maybe he's given up on giving the band his good stuff, after having three excellent songs flushed with the SOS non-release.  This one doesn't hold a candle to \"Plaid\", \"Cry For The Lost\", or \"The Show Must Go On\", any one of which is instantly better than anything else on this album.  On the other hand \"Better\" is, indeed, better than most of the rest of this disc.\n\nFeel (The Horn Section Mix) -- With the horns in place and a non-tenor lead vocal, this song really sounds like part of the natural evolution of the Chicago sound into the 21st century.  Too bad that the band, its management, and/or its record company didn't have the testicular fortitude to release this version to radio, choosing instead the bland and lifeless so-called \"Hot\" mix.  (Saying it doesn't make it so, guys!)  Apparently Chicago wants a hit but is unwilling to have their song be readily identified as a Chicago tune.  If they perform this live, will they wear Michael Buble masks (or maybe Lifehouse?)\n\nCome To Me, Do -- More proof that Robert Lamm can still write a killer song (and that he needs to have someone else come up with the titles -- this one's almost up there with \"It's A Groove, This Life\")  The song itself is classic Lamm and makes you want to hear more.  He's always had a knack for taking a simple concept and uncomplicated lyrics and creating something that's far more than the sum of the parts.  This one's a winner.\n\nTo sum up:  it's a new Chicago album.  You'll love it in proportion to how much you crave any new Chicago material vs. how much you'd really love to hear them give it their best shot.  Enjoy!\n\np.s. I rated this one officially at 3 stars because I really do still love Chicago after all these years, and because \"only a dope\" would express his true opinion in the face of a tidal wave of \"My God!  This is great!  Best they've ever done!\" reviews.  Really this release is in the 2-star to 2.5-star range, at best.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with \"0304,\" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.\nThe more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced \"Stand\" (\"It's a shame there's no one to blame/for all the pain that life brings...\"). But that vanishes with the wispy \"Run 2 U\" and pale \"2 Find U,\" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy \"Intuition,\" bouncy USA-themed song \"America,\" and shimmying \"Yes U Can.\" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous \"Haunted.\"\nNobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And \"0304\" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.\nWhen you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that \"0304\" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in \"Intuition\") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.\nUnfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (\"If u want my love/u can try my love/u can't buy my love/just take my hand\") The only exceptions to this are \"Stand\" and the sinister, stalker theme song \"Haunted.\" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.\n\"0304\" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty. Only time will tell if the folkie-turned-popster's new sound will take.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Since I've discovered Fernando Ortega, my love for Jesus has grown deeper roots. \"Give Me Jesus\" is simplicity...it is a wonder of Christian truth conveyed lovingly, beautifully, artistically. It has become  my morning prayer. I struggle with chronic illness, and it helps me to sing  along with Fernando, \"You can have all this world; give me  Jesus.\" No less beautiful and soul-anchoring are the other  songs...especially \"Come, oh Redeemer, come.\" This song is like  one of the laments in the Psalms...about real needs, weaknesses,  fears...yet always trusting in the Redeemer who hears our prayers.  \"Psalm 139\" again lifts my spirits up and out from my  circumstances and fills me with joy. Fernando Ortega is a vessel--a truly  talented and spirit-filled man--yet when I listen to him, I hear Christ.  That, to me, is the highest praise I can give.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have been a big fan of Revival in Belfast.  It's one of those CDs that I listen to regularly so I was excited when I read a review that called East of the River \"Robin's best release since Revival in Belfast\".\n\nUpon listening to the CD I did find a few favorites, songs that stuck in my head and touched my heart.  I found the expected honesty and purity of Robin Mark, but what I feel is missing is the energy of Revival in Belfast.  Maybe that energy comes from a live recording, but I feel like there's an edge that is missing in East of the River.  It still is an enjoyable album, but I wouldn't put it on par with Revival in Belfast.", "label": 2}

{"text": "When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their \"The Essential...\" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nIf this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and \"Thriller\" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.\n\nIf you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though \"I'll Be There\" and \"Dancing Machine\" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: \"Off The Wall\", \"Thriller\", \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit \"You Are Not Alone\" and the 2001 Top Ten single \"You Rock My World\".\n\nAs with most if not all entries in the \"Essential\" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that \"Thriller\" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as \"I'll Be There\", \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", \"Dancing Machine\", \"Ease On Down The Road\", the Paul McCartney \"Say, Say, Say\" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \"State Of Shock\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on \"Special Forces\".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear \"I Like Girls\" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include \"Zorro's Ascent\" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together \"Adaptable\", \"I Like Girls\", and \"Remarkably Insincere\".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  \"Tag You're It\" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" days.  \"It Better Be Good\" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  \"I Am The Future\" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  \"I'm Alive\" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most \"fun\" albums.", "label": 2}

Their style of METAL sounds like some contrived hybrid of FEAR FACTORY, CHAIMERA, MESHUGGA & INFLAMES - a bit too cyber/industrial sounding with nu-metal/metalcore attributes. According to my taste and standards, this is not true METAL at all. Just alot of noise and punch.

{"text": "With the disappointment of her previous album, \"Chyna Doll\", I did not anticipate that \"Broken Silence\" would be worth purchasing.  However, I gave Foxy the benefit of the doubt considering that the album's title, \"Broken Silence\" would change my opinion.  With a title like \"Broken Silence\", someone has alot to talk about so I went ahead and purchased it.  The lyrical skills reflected on \"Broken Silence\" brought back memories of when she first stepped onto the scene.  They are not candy coated, they are the grimy, hardcore lyrics that she spit to introduce herself to the rap game.  They are the same lyrics that she represented so well on Capone & Norega's, \"Bang Bang.\"  Now, I wouldn't say that she possesses the best lyrical talent but she does keep her rhymes real to the streets.  Like on \"BK Anthem\", she is here to represent Brooklyn.  Not only does \"BK Anthem\" rep for the streets, the beat is hot.  Quite a few tracks contain hot beats.  \"Candy\" featuring Kelis is another beat banger that will have you ready to hit the club up.  The album contains a strong reggae feel as well.  Foxy seems to have the Jamaican accent down pat.  On \"Run Dem\", she displays her accent which I found pretty good.  However, I felt that \"Saddest Day\" is a definite listener.  This song tells a story about relationships and I could really feel what she was rhyming about.  \"So Hot\" and \"Oh Yeah\" carry decent lyrics but the beat is what gets ya.  I know that the album contains \"Explicit Lyrics\" but I did not think a female was capable of utilizing so much profanity.  I guess you would say that was my least favorite part of \"Broken Silence.\"  Foxy does demonstrate a steady flow with decent lyrics but the beats is what broke the silence.", "label": 2}

The other tracks are pretty sterile for the most part.  If you're used to Trane's modal stuff or avant-garde playing, this is neither.

Instead of 'changing the way we think of rock', or whatever lofty egotistical goal he set himself, he succeeded in demonstrating his talent at the effects box, and the ability to drone on nasally.\nI have to give him credit, though. People certainly eat up his trite and repetative lyrics as \"deep\" and \"thought provoking\".

Lars does excellent on the drums but the double bass is up way too loud drowning out the bass guitar, as if he was trying to play the bass himself. Just listen to fight fire with fire, Creeping Death and Call of tulu. Kirk's guitar is good but nothing power driving or anything. He is a very overrated guitarist anyway, don't get me wrong he is good though, but he has to realize he is no Dave Mustaine, Mustaine could outplay Hammet with his hands tied behind his back if it came to it, and keep in mind metallica fans that doesnt mean Hammet is a bad guitarist at all. I just thought it was wrong how he stole Mustaine's music, when Mustaine specifically told them not to. Watch VH1's behind the music for Megadeth for yourself.\nLast, where is the bass? Nowhere to be found on this record as all metallica records. There is a 30 second killer bass line on For whom the bell tolls but once the second guitar comes in, the bass is drowned out. Cliff was a really good bassist too, too bad his work never shined like legendary bassists such as Steve Harris and Geezer Butler.\nAnd yes metallica fans there is no good bass required on this album, sorry. If there is then someone write a review and tell me where it is other then track three. Also its too bad this band became sell outs as well, but if your a fan of thrash metal then get this album. However these flaws are minor and may not matter to alot of people, but I think it is an overrated metallica album, the band is overrated now period anyway. Well im sure my review will be hated and criticized but at least I shared some proof on why there were these little flaws, instead of just having to think this album is godly. Please!!! This album couldn't touch Maiden's Powerslave or Dio's Last in Line which came out the same year. Metallica cant stand a chance against maiden or dio talent wise, Lyric wise, or production wise, and thats a fact. Of course both of these bands were some of metallica's main influences anyway. Still it was a good effort, but an overrated 80's metallica album and definitely not their best. Still worth adding to your collection.", "label": 2}

{"text": "These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well.  I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music.  Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.\n.\nI'd suggest picking up the 2-disc \"KING OF THE BLUES\".\nThat CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.

And as a result of the show's discontinuing the CD Soundtrack is out of print. All of the Rockapella songs are vocals only with no drums or instruments.

The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say \"people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away...\" this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a \"slow fade\" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.", "label": 1}

{"text": "A little over a year ago I submitted a fairly glowing review of Rhino's reissue of Chicago's Christmas album here on Amazon.  My positive comments were based on two factors.  First off, Rhino IS a reissue label first and foremost, and it would seem natural that they would want to reissue the Chicago Christmas album after they acquired the band's recorded output.  Secondly, Rhino really did the reissue up right with the inclusion of no less than six new songs to augment the album's previous recordings.  What's not to love, right?\n\nIt's the lack of those two mentioned criteria that I can't be more enthusiastic about the new \"Love Songs\" release.  Rhino's already issued a superb greatest hits collection for Chicago, and this is really not much more than a rehash of that.  With the exceptions of \"Here In My Heart\", \"Never Been In Love Before\", and 2 previously unissued tracks from the Chicago/Earth Wind And Fire tour from this past summer, (a DVD of which is rumored to be in the offing anyway), all of these tunes can already be found on Rhino's GH collection.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a nice cross-section of Chicago's recorded history, and all of the tunes fit in very nicely with the album's Valentine's Day-ish concept.  If you happen to be a casual music fan who may not have all of Chicago's previous collections and/or reissues, then by all means grab this up.  You can't go wrong with the music.\n\nMy negativity stems from the fact that the Chicago diehard fan base has been through so much already with various and assorted hits packages from more than just the Rhino Records label in the name of getting a couple of never before heard items.  It's time for Rhino to get to reissuing the remaining Chicago albums, (including the Carnegie Hall album), and putting the \"hits plus two\" concept to rest.  Even Chicago keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm insinuated surprise on his message board when he surmised that there are still \"people out there who need this music\".\n\nThe great white hope for the future is that there has been work progressing on an all-new original Chicago album, with Rascal Flatt's Jay Demarcus in the producer's chair, commencing recently.  A new album would certainly help the bitter pill of all these hits packages go down more smoothly as far as I'm concerned!  It's been too long since people have been reminded of what a great band Chicago still is, instead of the greatness that their past recordings have illustrated.", "label": 2}

I was hoping she'd do more of that, but instead she's made a very pop CD, which doesn't suit her very well.  If you're expecting the old Jewel on this album, you'll be disappointed.  Expect something more like Kylie Minogue dance songs, and you'll be better prepared for the shock.  ;)  This CD also seems to be lacking some of the more poetic lyrics that Jewel usually writes.

Eminem however, has far more talent then 50 cent when it comes down to lyrics and originality.  The only stand out tracks on this album (other than many men) are the ones he's featured on.  The rest of them are a bunch of I'll kill you, I'll blow your brains out, smoke a joint, etc. etc. kind of stuff. It's the kind of garbage you hear from a mediocre and uninventive rapper.

Tooth Fang and Claw is the last album Ted Nugent did with the Amboy Dukes.\nIt contains the instrumental Hibernation which Ted continued to play live for years in his solo career.

Of course there's never a dull moment at a Nuge show.\nThe hit Great White Buffalo originated on Tooth Fang and Claw.

Although it is as though rocket fuel were added to it and ignited.\nFree Flight is another instrumental that sounds alot like Homebound on the later \"Cat Scratch Fever\" album.\nSasha is uncharacteristic for Nuge in that it is slow and soft.  However it is all about his (then) infant daughter by the same name.\nIf you're a real Uncle Ted fan this is a must have album.

{"text": "Artist: Cats In Boots\nAlbum: Kicked & Klawed\nYear: 1989\nRating: 3 Stars\nReview: Cats In Boots' first and only album is a fair release. First of all the album peaked at #40 in Japan, but was a failure everywhare else. From an American point of view, the album isn't bad, but isn't quite good either. Most of the songs just aren't as catchy as those by many American Bands. Despite, the album sounds pretty good, with Ripping guitars, and thrashy rythms. Joe Ellis screams, squeels and howls viciously throughout the album. Cats In Boots' biggest hit \"Shotgun Sally\" was probably their breakthrough hit in Japan, but I didn't catch on to it much. \"Her Monkey\" is my personal favorite on the album, with thrashy guitars and an intense screaming chorus. Kicked & Klawed is best described as Hair Metal on steroids, with a shot of thrash. The only \"Ballad\" on the album is a very \"evil sounding\" song called \"Every Sunrise\".

I feel fortunate that the only track I purchased was \"Indian Reservation.\"  It is not bad, and basically the arrangement remains true to the original.  It's a little slicker, and little less raw, and thus, it lacks some of the bite of the original.  According to reviews of the entire album, some of the tracks stray far more from the original arrangements and stylistic feels than this one.  Although the audio quality and the performance quality are cleaner than that of the early 1970s original, I'd recommend the original, especially if you remember it from all those years ago.

Some may say she is selling herself out in order to sell more but I believe it is not the case.

{"text": "I recently got this album after buying Master of Puppets and was kind of disappointed by it.  Overall, I find it kind of tedious.  While there are some very good moments that show the band's talents, they don't last long enough to really earn the album more than 3 stars. I do give Metallica credit for some thoughtful lyrics, but they are all delivered in an uninspired fashion with no attempt to differentiate them.  Perhaps, I would have approached this album with different expectations if I had listened to it before Master of Puppets.  But I might not have even purchased MOP if I had started with this one.\n\nI should let you know that I consider myself more a \"hard rock\" fan than a \"heavy metal\" fan.  My favorite groups include Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Rainbow, Dio, Symphony X, and Dream Theater. So my tastes lean more toward early metal, hard rock, and progressive metal. I admit that I have no taste at all for the music played on Sirius/XM Liquid Metal. If you love thrash metal and death metal, you'll probably consider me an over-the-hill loser.  But if you're in your 40s or 50s and like the bands I like, my review might have more relevance for you.\n\nMost of the songs start with nice instrumental openings, but they descend to monotonous thrash attacks after these promising beginnings. I find little melodic or rhythmic variety in the songs after James Hetfield starts singing.  \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and \"Fade to Black\" are the only songs that approach the maturity of the songs on MOP.  The chorus on \"Escape\" is memorable and \"Creeping Death\" does have a good guitar solo in the middle.  My favorite song on the album is actually the instrumental \"The Call of Ktulu\".  Given my negative comments on Hetfield's singing, that might not be too surprising.", "label": 2}

The only song that seems to stand out as different from the rest is In Too Deep, which sounds like Sugar Ray and is also the next single. Pain for Pleasure is different, but it is a joke song mocking hard rock. (I like PFP, because I hate hard rock) You get tired of listening to this CD if you start from the beginning, so if you are like me it might take time to discover the ending tracks.

THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.\n\nThis collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including \"I'll Be There\", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.\n\nIt is wonderful reliving hits such as \"I Want You Back\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Thriller\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\", \"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\", and etc... 4 stars.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I've been a Dream Theater fan since about 92' actually Images and Words was the first CD i ever bout(when tapes started becoming outdated). So its no suprise that i've enjoyed Petrucci's playing for quite sometime now. To start this is not a DT album, it is by definition basic petrucci by himself without the help of any other writers, so if your looking for DT listen to DT. I usually find that a lot of first time solo artists get stuck in \"repetition\" and don't really know when to bring in a hook, chorus, solo, mid-section etc etc,or that may be the only thing they do over and over which gets old quickly. Petrucci gets stuck just a little but manages to break the monotany by his usual brilliant solo work. So unlike Vinnie Moore, Tony McAlpine, and Alex Skolnick(although great guitarist's) they pretty much go with a pattern and never go outside the lines(or the book), which makes for a pretty basic, boring listen at times.\n\nSo while Petrucci doesn't have the experience of being a solo artist like Satriani and Vai, he does bring some unique qualities to the table, his 3 and 6 string sweeps, his odd chord progressions, and speed picking all give him his own definative style. I myself prefer his complex playing with DT but this is still worth a listen if you love solo guitar albums. Also I would have to agree with another reviewer that he does borrow quite a few licks from Joe Satriani, namely in the song \"Curve\" which sounds almost identical to the songs Surfing with an Alien, and Flying in a Blue Dream, but hey who \"isn't\" influenced by Joe, he broke the mold for solo guitar artists!! So with a few more albums i'll bet Petrucci will hit the nail on the head with a signature album, until then this will due. Not bad John.", "label": 2}

The production of the album is fantastic.  The instruments generally sound great, the mix is excellent, and there's a nice depth to each instrument.\nBut the songs are... really poor.  The lyrics are overly simplistic, and I can hear her reliance on rhyming dictionary rhymes, rather than saying what she intends to say.\nThe songs have little, if anything complex in the lyrics.\nThe songs are also overly long.  This is a big sticking point for me.  I think the performances on the album would be better suited to live performances, letting the songs stretch out a bit more.  On the album, it comes across as a needless indulgence.\nStrangely, the album reminded me a whole lot of Tuesday Night Music Club.  Gravelly-voiced female singers, both had a fair amount of simplistic songs.

{"text": "I have to admit that I hated this album for many, many years. About two or three weeks ago, I started to listen to it again, and discovered that it's not nearly as awful as I originally thought it was. The whole story and concept behind the album is absolutely ridiculous and convuluted and confusing. Sandy Pearlman's lyrics have always been tough to decipher, even with the aid of a lyric sheet..which is not included here.\n\nThe album actually started out in 1981 as a colloboration between Pearlman and drummer Al Bouchard, who was just kicked out of B.O.C. Work continued, on and off, for about three years before Pearlman and Bouchard presented it to CBS Records, who hated it and refused to release it. The album was shelved for a few years before Pearlman suggested that they get Eric Bloom, Buck Dharma and Al Lanier involved and release it as a new Blue Oyster Cult album. CBS agreed and work was resumed on the album. Also appearing is guitarists Joe Satriani, Aldo Nova and Robbie Krieger, along with drummer Thommy Price, keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck and at least a dozen other people. Though Joe Bouchard's name show up in the credits, he claims he barely played on the album at all.\n\nThe first five songs all kick major rump....this is without a doubt the heaviest album B.O.C. ever made, even though I don't consider it a true Blue Oyster Cult album...this is more like Sandy Pearlman's idea of Blue Oyster Cult. Anyhow, I absolutely love \"I Am The One You Warned Me Of\", which contains one of Bloom's most commanding vocal performances ever. The four songs that follow it, \"Les Invisibles\", \"In The Presence of Another World\", \"Del Rio's Song\" and that Frankenstein song are all great...very heavy, with some terrific singing and very catchy music.\n\nTo me, the album completely falls apart starting with the sixth song. The remakes of \"The Subhuman\" and \"Astronomy\" do nothing for me...I never liked the song \"Astronomy\" that much to begin with! The album is way overproduced and the story, as I said earlier is outright confusing. I guess in that aspect I'm glad they didn't print the lyrics!

Sum41's songs are catchy and downright horrible.  That's an aneurysm waiting to happen.

This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than \"Breezin\" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his \"Weekend In LA\" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.\n3.5 stars", "label": 2}

{"text": "The sophmore release from rising melodic/liquid/chill dubstep producer Blackmill.\n\nEverything that was present in Reach For Glory is here in spades. His sound is more mature, more refined, smoother, and just better in every way imaginable.\n\nMiracle is a strong lead into the album. It begins with a smooth piano piece and slowly slips into smooth dubstep with vocal samples over top with warm synths throughout.\n\nSpirit Of Life is more progressive in nature than many of the other tracks. It has a fairly long build/lead-in to the first break, but when it hits, it hits. As with most every Blackmill song, you have smooth piano orchestration, warm synths, and smooth dubstep elements. This track has a very uplifting feel to it, and constantly feels like it is building throughout its runtime. Excellent track.\n\nLet It be (ft. Veela) is sombre in tone and sound. It features vocal samples as well as full vocal verses. Veela has a soft and beautiful voice, fitting the Blackmill sound flawlessly. The song appears to be about a (modern) long distance relationship, possibly between two who have split apart but come back into contact with one another. This track is especially powerful for me as it describes my situation at current flawlessly.\n\nEmbrace, like the word would imply, is soft and warm. It feels predominantly like a DnB track, but builds into a softer dubstep track toward the conclusion.\n\nDon't Let Me Down (ft. Cat Martin) is very light in tone and uplifting, despite what the title may imply. An excellent track, but not terribly much evolves within the track.\n\nMy Love is also slightly sombre in feel and the vocal samples are used to great effect, forming a very interesting main beat over the dubstep backing. It has a slow but powerful progression and some decent evolution of sound throughout.\n\nThe Drift is a bit harder than Blackmill's previous work, yet still features beautiful piano orchestration and strings on top of cold synths. Picture credit music for a film, and you'll get a feel for the \"epic\" tone this track sets.\n\nLucid Truth is uplifting and light in tone. At the risk of sounding redundant, piano is heavily featured over warm synth and subdued wubs.\n\nLove At Heart feels a bit more like a breakbeat track at first, maybe liquid DnB. The dubstep aspects are fairly minimal. It is warm, light, but uptempo and driven. Pretty awesome track, something to drive to.\n\nSarajevo is a remix of a Loz Contreras track (Admittedly, have not heard the original). It is a bit darker and colder in tone compared to the rest of the album. It has vocal samples, but they are very subdued and sad sounding. An interesting track, and very nice to listen to.\n\nFortune Soul carries some of the more sombre and dark tones found in Sarajevo over. It however, is more high energy and a great way to end the album.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic release and every bit as excellent as the first album, and in most every way, a great improvement.\n\nDon't hesitate a moment.

Most of the reviews with five stars here that ive bothered to read mentioned FNF and natural born chaos, Korn or mudvayne. The fact is if you are truly out for great swedish metal pick up opeth or some of Soilwork's older stuff. Dark Tranquillity's new album was absolutely amazing and I guess I was just expecting a little bit more from Soilworks new album. Chainheart machine is a classic, Steelbath is impressive as well but ever since Natural Born Chaos they have taken a more predictable path. This album is no different. The drums are really well done, but the absence of guitar solos and the formulaic pattern of the songs is a big turn off. Listening to some of the solos from the earlier albums (namely chainheart or predators portrait) I think that soilwork has one of the best lead guitarist in the business but their latest works have all but wasted their talent. There are a few catchy tunes but recently, listening to them around my dimmu borgir, children of bodom, opeth and older in flames/soilwork albums this one is lackluster at best. If you want a truly great album check out Opeth's Still Life, Children of Bodom's Follow the Reaper, Into Eternity's Buried in Oblivion or Chainheart Machine", "label": 2}

{"text": "I was a student of Ayn Rand's philosophy and a patient of Mr. Branden's several decades ago, in the early 70's. Why? Because I was trying in vain to live as Ms. Rand said we should: as heroic figures every day, perfect in our morals, that we should aspire to be as perfect as the impossibly perfect,cold, robotic main characters of her novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shugged. The only book of hers I read several times was We The Living as the characters were most like flesh and blood and real.\n\nWhile I was going to Group at Mr. Branden's house I had no idea that he'd had an affair with Ayn Rand as it was apparently known only to some insiders I'd guess. Had I known, I would have immediately ended the relationship. As it was he was totally ineffectual as a therapist, barely able to stay awake while we spoke, and like comic shrinks in movies, lets you answer your own questions when you're paying HIM to! Years later, 15 free minutes with Dr. Laura on the radio fixed the problem I had (guilt over the death of a family member.)\n\n The upside of all this:I did know Patrecia who was changed to another fictional woman in the movie. She was a Goddess. All the men loved her, all  the women wanted to BE her. She was the essence of joy and life and she died way too young....slight epilepsy that was caused by strobing sunlight dancing off the pool whereupon she had a seizure and fell into the water, drowning.\n\nNow I see that the high moral standards we underlings were supposed to uphold were completely tossed out the window by Ms. Rand and Mr. Branden. Barbara Brandon's book also reported that Ms. Rand was often under the influence of some seriously strong amphetamines and I'm sure if she saw I had done the same thing , she'd have blasted me for not having the moral courage to go through life without artificial courage.\n\nI admire Ms. Rand for her works and her diligent fight against Communism (she is reeling in her grave at where our country stands now!), but it turned out to be do as I say, not as I do. I wasted a lot of years trying to be what she thought we should all aspire to. We can't. It's an impossibility. We are human, with human frailties which she and Nathaniel obviously both succumbed to. You just can't change Nature, which Ayn hated because she only loved that which was man-made. You can take some of this philosophy, but toss out what isn't right for you, otherwise you're a round peg in a very tight, painful square hole.\n\nI believe this movie was a hatchet job to discredit her as she  always stated:\n\n\"The best way to destroy greatness is to celebrate the mediocre.\" Or words to that affect.\n\nJust look at who eats up all the news 7 days a week: Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsey, Anna-Nicole, etc, ad nauseum!\n\nAtlas Shrugged is rumored to be in the works with Angelina Jolie, but don't hold your breath.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The CD version of this LP has no liner notes. The Meters, New Orleans Funk  Masters and pre-cursors to the Neville Brothers, had toured with Palmer and  their sound is distinctive on several tracks. Most notably, the syncopated,  funky groove they set up on the medley of Sailin' Shoes (A Little Feat  tune) and Sneakin' Sally through the Alley (first recorded by Lee  Dorsey)sounds distinctively Meters. Lowell George (from Little Feat) also  contributes on guitar. Much of this recording sounds like a Little  Feat/Meters collaboration--on the face of it not a bad idea. The only  problem is that Robert Palmer is a second-rate R & B vocalist. His  sound is whiny and, particularly on \"Through it all there's You\",  comes across as distant and weak, as if he ingested way too many pain  killers, gin and tonics, or both. \"Through it all there's You\",  really is a highlight of the album--in spite of Mr. Palmer's annoying  gurglings. Bernard Purdie is the drummer on the tune and, as is customary  when he drives a band, the downbeat is defined so clearly that even  Methodists would know when to clap.

{"text": "Helen Mirren -- as usual -- gives an excellent performance as Ayn Rand, and she's the main reason to see this film.  The rest of the cast is fine; the script -- which should have been called \"The Panic Attacks of Barbara Branden\" or \"The Affairs of Nathaniel Branden\" -- assumes the viewer already knows everything about Ayn Rand's fiction and philosophy.  This is a big problem.  For example, near the beginning the Brandens are shown meeting Ayn Rand and her husband at their home in California.  This brief scene then cuts to the young couple driving away, filled with excitement about the hours they've just spent talking with their idol, Ayn Rand.  Unfortunately the viewer isn't given a clue as to what their all-night conversation was about.\n\nThis film would've been far more interesting if the focus had been more on Rand and her ideas, not mainly on the sex between her and Nathaniel Branden, or on Barbara's fainting spells.  There should have been at least two or three scenes between Rand and the Brandens, or with Rand giving speeches or interviews, that would serve to clarify what her ideas were and why they attracted and influenced so many people in the 1950s and 60s.  (There is one brief exchange of dialogue at an Objectivist lecture where Rand answers a question about her core beliefs by stating: \"Reason.  Individualism.  Capitalism.\", but that's all we get to hear, folks.)  Otherwise the film makes it difficult to understand why Rand became such a magnetic cult-figure and was able to command such devotion from her friends and followers.\n\nOnce again: see it for Mirren's performance, but try to imagine a better script.", "label": 2}

It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not \"bootlegs\" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.  I don't know if there has ever been a legal release of this material on CD, but there are at least two (probably many  more) really good quality bootleg CDs that contain this material, in true studio quality, with no hiss or surface noise.\n\nFinally, there are 3 original Lennon/McCartney songs: Loved of the Loved, Hello Little Girl and Like Dreamers Do.  While not lost classics by any means, they provide a valuable glimpse into their really early writing style.", "label": 2}

{"text": "There is not a whole lot a remastering job can do with an album that was basically homebrewed by Winwood, where he not only played all of the instruments, but produced and mixed as well. Co-written with hit monster Will Jennings, who had penned hits for soul acts like Cool & The Gang (which is the theme here), not to mention two huge movie theme hits like Up Where We Belong, My Heart Will Go On, and Tears In Heaven (w/ Eric Clapton). So you'd expect these songs would be strong, and lyrically they are, albeit very plaintiff. But musically, they are rather mellow and downright James Taylor-like considering Winwood's rock background.\n\nThis was an album looking forward and beyond much of the rock and adult contemporary of the day, and back then, it sounded very modern. It owes very little to progressive rock of Winwood's past, but instead borrows heavily from Gary Wright's pioneering effort from '76, Dream Weaver, an album that no doubt influenced Don Henley on his own synth drenched first two solo efforts (Dream Weaver still sounds better than much of what it influenced).\n\nPerhaps I'd like this better if it were mixed better, which is why it only gets 3 stars. The only thing that could truly improve the sound here would be a remixing and not just remastering, because Winwood's mix is so synth heavy and his instrumental accumen isn't worthy of the material. This album was recorded in a time when synthesizers weren't really developed enough to do what Winwood was asking of them, and perhaps he didn't have the experience with the newer equipment that he did with older technologies like Mellotron and Moog, et al. The resulting sound is a tad shrill, with dominating keys and anemic bass. What a wonder this album coulda been with a top-notch supporting cast of musicians.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Consider the following: Marvin Gaye and John Lennon each get shot once or twice and they die.  This loser gets shot nine times...AND LIVES!!??  What has he contributed to the world?  Gaye and Lennon both wrote excellent music.  They wrote form the heart and...My God their songs actually had substance and a melody!  They did not believe in violence and while they did a few foolish things in their lives they were blessed and will always be remembered.\n\n  This guy does foolish things everyday if not every second.  He writes from his underdeveloped and violent mind rather than his heart, or if he does write from his heart it must he must have a very black heart indeed. Sadly his beliefs that violence, gangs, drugs, sex, and the objectation of women are acceptable have gained him millions of followers who apparently find this stuff to be \"cool\" and \"hip\".\n\n  I am not entirely against rap.  Once upon a time rap music was a serious and major cultural influence.  It had many political and social vaules.  Just listen to songs like Grandmaster Flash's, \"The Message\", or Public Enemy's, \"Fight The Power\", and you'll get the idea.  Back then rap actually had substance and vaules.  Then it morphed into modern Hip-Hop and it's all been down hill since then.  Now rappers rap about how rich and dangerous they are and how they can kill and have sex with anyone they want but no one will care because they are so cool and, \"in\".\n\n  At 18, I guess I suppose to like this crap because this is what the kids all listen to...WRONG!!!  Unlike Run-DMC or even Emimen, 50 Cent has no power when he raps.  He just mumbles and uses every slang and profane word he can think of.  But profanity and absurd slang is supposed to be, \"cool\", so that's why his songs top the charts.  The background, \"music\", is absurd too.  Its just the same video game music looped over six milllion times for the whole duration of the song.\n\n  If you want real music, buy a Beatles, Elvis, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, or even Madonna album.  If you want real rap, buy a Grandmaster Flash, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, or even Eminem CD.  Stay away from this like it were AIDS or some other STD.

{"text": "It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.\n\nAll in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nMastering: A-\n\nSongs: B 1/2+\n\nPrice: B\n\nOverall: B 1/2+", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is a fairly good CD, where hit songs like Fat Lip and In Too Deep sound similar to the Beastie Boys vocals, the rest of the album sounds similar to Blink 182. With the skateboarding craze that is now going on, this album is the perfect hyperactive edge for kids to go boarding to. None of the songs last more than 3 minutes, for a CD that lasts only 35 minutes. Nothing On My Back is a great way to start the songs of the album (apart from the 30 second Introduction To Destruction), because it sets the fast pace of this album. Never Wake Up is a 49 second speeding interlude, before going to another song, Fat Lip, which combines lots of Blink 182 punk and Beastie Boys mainstream fun, in a song that goes at fast punk speeds, then slows down once in a while for something that sounds like a ballad. Rhythms, sounds like it is Blink 182, and if you did not know better, you would think so too \"I know what I want, and that's more than you can say!\" Motivation is more Blink 182 punk sounds and rhyming lyrics, \"Motivation, such an aggravation, accusations, don't know how to take them.\" In Too Deep is more of an alterna / punk / pop song that focuses more on the vocals than the guitars in the background. Handle This is probably the softest song on the album and it still rocks in slow punk fashion with some good guitar work. Summer, starts the fast pace of the CD again, sounding like Blink 182 yet again with wailing vocals \"whoa-oh-ah-oh... its not in what you do more than what you say.\" Crazy Amanda, has a good guitar melody with fast chorus, again sounding much like Blink 182. All She's got sounds like all Sum 41 has, more fast punk pop (sounds like Blink 182), there are no notable lyrics either. Heart Attack changes the style, it now sounds like Greenday with the same guitar chords as Longview (Dookie album) between moderately paced vocals. Pain For Pleasure is not a long song (1:45) and has a metal sound along the lines of Judaist Priest, in fact the singer from Judaist Priest accompanies Sum 41 in singing.", "label": 2}

Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's \"Chasin' the Wind.\" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.\n\nThere's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  \"If You Leave Me Now\" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is \"After the Love Is Gone\" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  \"Never Been in Love Before\" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And \"Here in My Heart\" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.\n\nSo what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?\n\nDon't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I purchased this album as a devotee of their early, pre-top 40 albums, and was hoping that this would in some way tell the full story implied by songs on their greatest album, Secret Treaties.  Unfortunately, it doesn't actually tell the whole story, and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock.  It starts off with one of it's less-cheesy songs, I Am the One You Warned Me Of, but gets cheesier and cheesier from there.  The album does provide an interesting alternative realization of Astronomy (the climactic song on Secret Treaties), which was the one song I did add to my iTunes library.  The song Blue Oyster Cult was an alternative take on the Secret Treaties song Subhuman, also not one of the worst songs on the album.  However, the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album, also the album's title song, and should be climactic, not an homage to 80's schlock; it reminds me of the theme song to the John Carpenter film Big Trouble in Little China, which played over the end credits of that film.  Of course, taste is an individual thing, and I could be trashing songs that others enjoy a lot.  In that spirit, I'd like to say that if you liked 70's and 80's art rock concept albums, like the Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and the Imagination album by the Alan Parsons Project (which is the best example I can give of an album similar to this one), you may well like this album.  Alternately, if you'd like to explore Blue Oyster Cult truly at their best, obtain and listen to their first three albums (Blue Oyster Cult, Tyranny and Mutation, and Secret Treaties) in order, and then you will get a sense of what I'd hope this album would be.", "label": 0}

It somehow just doesn't seem be very genuine. Let's face it, October Rust, Bloody Kisses and most of the other stuff, struck some powerful chords. Dead Again just kind of wanders around through this Pseudo Beatles, pop, cheese thing... like they are trying way too hard to sell records.\n\n  I own everything from Type O & Carnivore and this one is my least favorite. Maybe it will grow on me but I doubt it. The first time I heard TON was well over 15 years ago and I just couldn't get into them back then. After I grew up, I listened to them again about 7 years ago and was able to relate to them. I had to go out and get everything they ever did and now I listen to them almost daily. Who knows, maybe when I'm an old man like Pete, I will find that this is the greatest thing ever recorded... I still doubt it though.\n\n  To anyone who hasn't heard this yet, I suggest that you check it out at the Library or at least listen to some samples before buying it. I don't care what anybody says, this one sounds much different than the Type O Negative that you are probably expecting. If you like happy pop music like Rush, Yes & the Beatles then you will probably love this, if you expect something a little more thoughtful, darker and more cynical... maybe not so much.\n\n  So does this mean that I think that TON is dead and washed up? No. I have faith that with the impending doom that the world faces today, Pete & Josh will be back on the Anti-Depressants & Booze in no time and will be back to their old selves again shortly. Just because Peter Steele is a filthy rich, 7 foot tall, ex-playgirl model, I know he really hurts on the inside...\n\n So to any of you who take any kind of criticism of Type O Negative as a personal insult...

And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines.

{"text": "Overview:\nSky Blue is another well written Maria Schneider album.  Once again Schneider has written complex hand crafted tunes for her big band that interweave many different parts and feature some great soloists.  The overall style of this album is world jazz fusion.  Schneider has incorporated many sounds and styles of South America into this release.  Over twenty musicians play on Sky Blue, including personal favorites, Donny McCaslin on tener sax & clarinet, and guitarist Ben Monder.  Big band fans, and Schneider fans alike will enjoy this recent release and should add it to their collection.  However, jazz fans who are only considering this album because of the rave reviews it received in many magazines and online publications may want to reconsider.  While this is a nice album, it doesn't come close to being one of the top CDs of 2007.\n\nSong Highlights:\nAires de Lando:  The \"Aires\" here no doubt refers to Buenos Aires as this song incorporates many latin themes and tango elements.  Schneider has beautifully integrated latin rhythms and tango moods into wonderful South American fusion.  The accordian integration is particullary nice.\n\nRich's Piece:  This song has some really nice moody horn arrangements that somewhat resemeble arrangements from Mile Davis and Gill Evans Porgy and Bess.  Over the top of these somber horns Rich Perry has a brilliant sax solo.\n\nCerulean Skies:  This is the song which received the most hype in the reviews of this album.  Further it features Donny McCaslin (one of my favorite sax players) as a soloist as well as Gary Versace on an accoridian solo.  I had extremely high expectations for this song and I was disappointed.  The song opens with some bird calls and has the feel of the amazon rain forest.  Some listeners may find this this to be a bit \"new agey\".  Persoanlly I thinked it worked and the song was off to a good start.  McCaslin then comes in with the first solo.  The solo starts off nice, and McCaslin's solo starts to build.  Its at this point that the song goes off track.  As McCaslin's solo builds the backing arrangements are just annoying and cheesy and take away from the solo.  After McCaslin is done it's accordian player Versace's turn.  This section of the song is prety nice but seems a bit out of place.  At this point the song is starting to seem a bit long and your only halfway through it.  Cerulean Skies is the center piece of this album and it doesn't live up to the hype.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a \"sell-out\" once she switched things up at all. No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more. Jewel's fourth album \"0304\" takes a more electronica/dance approach than its guitar-driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there. The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album's release, June 2003, the big dance-pop bang from the late 90's and even 2000/2001 was over which suggests that this wasn't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends. Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception.\n\nThe album starts off with the social commentary song entitled \"Stand\". The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on \"hookers and hash\". The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems. Next up is the first evidence of Jewel's new style, \"Run 2 U\". Everything from the internet-style writing in the title (numbers instead of words) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me, it still works. The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel's usual meaningful lyrics (\"I need you for dark reasons, for greed and lust...\"). Thirdly. We have the first single \"Intuition\" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene. The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head. While it is good to dance to, it still maintains the positive message of following your heart.\n\nNext is \"Leave The Lights On\" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album. I love the way Jewel's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better. (\"If you want my love, you can try my love, you can't buy my love\"). It's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it, but she can do better. The song after, \"2 Find U\" reminds me of \"Standing Still\" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is \"Fragile Heart\", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is \"Doin' Fine\" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.\n\nThen comes \"2 Become 1\", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is \"Haunted\" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's \"Possesion\"). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is \"Sweet Temptation\" which seems like a better version of \"2 Become 1\". They both talk about the same subject however \"Sweet Temptation\" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than \"2 Become 1\".\n\nThe next song, \"Yes U Can\" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (\"Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song\"). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. \"U & Me = Love\" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like \"Intuition\" and \"Stand\" than this song or the one before it. After that is \"America\", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (\"The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell\") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is \"Becoming\" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.\n\nOverall Mark: 3/5\n\nWhile most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with \"Stand\" and \"Intuition\"). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until \"Fragile Heart\", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before.", "label": 2}

At first review, I thought this might be a pretty good album.  But after more and more listens, I'm finding that this album lacks a certain amount of emotional depth.  So I guess if you liked her first album, then you'll like this album I guess.

They sound so bad on this CD that they sounded better on my  junky 1980s Fingerhut stereo.\n\nSecond, the list of tracks on Amazon only lists track 3, Prince Song, as being a live recording.

Although time had to be conserved while making the double cd, I didn't care for 45 single edited verions of Don't Stop Till You Get Enough (you DONT CUT OUT THE INTRO, you edit it like it was on the video) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin'.  The later was the first time it was included on any cd and was edited terribily.  Ditto for Thriller.  Other than 45 versions and absense of I'll Be There, Lovely One and Say Say Say, CD 1 displayed MJ's best.  As for CD 2 (stuff from Bad, Dangerous, and one each from History and Invincible) I could care less, but I do agree with previous reviews about adding Scream (with Janet - #2 R&B and #5 pop) instead of Dangerous (which was NOT even a hit in the U.S.).  If the record company was to include MJ's lp tracks, they should put in Lady In My Life or Workin' Day & Night.  Although I do not actually own a copy (I listen to most of the edited songs), They did pick most of the good songs to be included, but Thriller, Dont Stop, Off The Wall (too) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin' are hit songs that should NOT be included edited! - Nuff Said", "label": 0}

I've heard this c.d. twice now, and, though it has some nice moments, I can't help but feel that this is one of the saddest cases of \"sell-out\" that I've ever seen/heard. When Jewel came on the scene, I couldn't believe the beauty and power in her simplicity, and the impact of her \"poetry.\" I still have the video of her on \"Hard Rock Live\", which I consider to be one of the most beautiful performances I've ever seen. No flash, no gobs of make-up and booty...just a naturally gorgeous little girl, her acoustic guitar, and her incredible, raw, natural talent. What a breath of fresh air she was, and I still consider \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" a classic. Though no one expects an artist to keep singing the same song for 20 years without becoming bored & wanting to change and grow, listening to this effort, it's obvious she was given a total make-over by the money brokers -that be. I saw her recently on VH1's \"Divas\", which coincided with the release of this recording, and, I couldn't believe it when I saw her come out, I thought I was seeing Pamela Anderson. At the risk of sounding unkind, she looked ridiculous.  Her discomfort was palpably, painfully evident...I have not seen anyone look that uncomfortable since President Clinton said \"I never had sex with that girl.\" Not only was she out of place, she was all - around bad. Look, life is hard enough when you're an unknown nobody like me, so I can only imagine the pressures that are upon a known artist to \"produce\", stay with the times, etc...It takes a lot of courage I'm sure to stay true to your own vision, and, many do not. I'm not judging them, but I am incredibly sad that this wonderfully talented girl has allowed herself to be transformed into a second- rate Brittney/Shakira. These recordings aren't necessarily bad, they're just, with the exception of one or two, run of the mill formula songs, in my opinion, made for mass consumption. No calories, no taste, & no feeling.

What do you think?\n12-Like My Style : Surely enough, another great beat, but still lyrically weak and lacking of meaning.\n13-Poor Lil Rich : This song is so sickening i don't think i've ever heard it from A to Z. 50 is just tooo weak.\n14-21 Questions : This man has been shot, stabbed, sent to jail, and he ends up rappin about stuff like \"If i wrote u a love letter would you write back?\"\n15-Don't Push Me: Amazing beat, Eminem and Lloyd Banks drop some serious rhymes and flows in this one. But 50, though and improvement from other rhymers, he still can't match up to the other rhymes on this track\n16- gotta make it to heaven : And this rate, he won't even make it to the gates.\n(Bonus)\n17-Wanksta : You heard it ain't you? Notice the way the talked about a shawty and about then talks about his homeys and then disses a gangsta. This man has no focus on what he's rapping about.\n18- U Not Like Me: Catchy Chorus, nice beat, okay rhymes.\nAll in all , run from this CD. u can learn nothing from 50 as an aspiring rapper, but if you just want to dance, then by all means get this album", "label": 0}

At the end, the album as a whole did not surpass their debut album Catch A Fire nor did it surpass many of Bob's records after it.\n\nThe forte of the first album was the variety of emotional melodies and its accentuated instrumentality (as far as root-reggae for 1973). In this one, the recurrence to rhythmic formulas starts to become present, the sound was more simplistic. In reality, Bob Marley and the Wailers never again did an album with such caliber as Catch A Fire.

My sincere hope was that Chicago XXX would do for them\n\nwhat Steely Dan's 'Two Against Nature' did for them - bring them back\n\nstrong enough to trigger a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination and\n\na big Grammy win. Unfortunately, even I can't see it. I am still, and\n\nalways will be, unwavering in my respect for this band (especially\n\nthe original members and Bill Champlin). However. . .\n\nAllowing so much output both in writing and in vocals from one of the\n\nweakest links in the band, Jason Scheff, was perhaps the biggest\n\nmistake of this project. His sappy love songs and poor attempts at\n\ncapturing Cetera's success with same, leaves half of the album\n\ndismissible. Bill Champlin has never been so under-utilized and it\n\nhurts, like salt on an open wound. Robert Lamm, however, is in rare\n\nform on a couple of tunes and that made the album worth it for me. As\n\na former trombone player who probably owes more than can be written\n\nhere to James Pankow, I was disappointed that he did not write any\n\ntunes on this album. To make matters worse, this undeniable force of\n\nnature in the horn arrangement category seems to have fallen asleep\n\nthroughout the entire recording session. Don't get me wrong, he's\n\nstill the best trombone player in the business. Nobody can touch that\n\nsignature sound, but it's wasted on these bland and repetitive overlays.\n\nHere's my vote for keepers on this album, in order of strength:\n\n1 Feel (believe it or not, the non-horn version - am I saying that?)\n\n2 90 Degrees and Freezing (but I could live without Scheff's whine)\n\n3 Lovin' Chains (this is the only Champlin tune, in my opinion, that\n\nreally takes advantage of what this powerhouse musician can do)\n\n4 Come To Me, Do (barely)\n\nAfter ten years, you'd think Pankow, Lamm and Champlin could pull\n\ntogether eight super songs and let Scheff have a couple. I'll pay my\n\nmoney for their album, I'll even pay my money to see them in concert\n\n(which I will do in about a week), but I can't cheer for this album\n\nnor recommend it to anyone but the most diehard Chi fan.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a pretty good album alright, but exactly how highly you rate it may depend on a couple of factors.\nFirst, you should know that this was the last album of the original three Wailers, and that if you are really into the music of Peter Tosh (I can't say that I am), then you may prefer this to the later albums featuring Marley as the sole leader (which is my point of view). Anyway, just to point out that you do have Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer singing and playing here.\nSecondly the album has Marley's most commercially successful song I Shot the Sheriff, which was covered by Eric Clapton and was a #1 hit in the US. Other than that there are great versions of Get Up Stand Up, and Burnin' and Lootin', as well as some songs also heard in prototype versions on African Herbsman.\nThe next studio album Natty Dread was for me a big leap forwards, and at least one expert agreed with me:\nBetta music, betta lyrics... it have a betta feelin'. Catch A Fire and Burnin' have a good feelin', but Natty Dread is improved.\" (Bob Marley, 1974).\nHowever, for the Marley/Wailers completist, this is a classic album and not to be missed.

{"text": "This album has the distinction of being the only album with co-writing credits by Elton and lyricist Gary Osbourne. Osbourne mostly had commercial jingles to his credit before this, and these lyricis could have been perfect for a 30 second tv commercial. Yea, they're that basic and simplified. No dark sense of humor, no sly British references, no sense of irony. Where have you gone Bernie Taupin?\nWith that said, Elton's first and thankfully last album with Osbourne has its moments. Elton is just incapable of making a total disaster (aside from the disco attempt Victim of Love which followed this release). There are some decent tunes here such as the nicely done ballad Shine on Through. And It Ain't Gonna Be Easy is great for the first 5 minutes but just goes on and on for way too long. Shooting Star offers a nice jazzy sax solo and features a very whisper-like vocal.\nReturn to Paradise and Georgia are routine at best, though again it's Elton vocal that saves these songs from being just album filler. Song For Guy is the best song here. And when an instrumental is the best song on an Elton John album, it tells you something.\nA lot of the songs just don't hold up that well. I Don't Care is just boring and doesn't go anywhere and the lyrics are so pedestrian, well, it's a wonder it even made it on the album. Big Dipper is a very tongue-in-cheek fun song which doesn't seek repeated listenings. Madness wants to be serious and dramatic but comes off flat and safe. Part-time Love is a jumpy little song that tries really hard to make you like it.\nProduced by Elton and sound engineer Clive Franks, the album features Elton's piano playing prominently. It is way up in the mix as well as Elton's voice. There is a clean, spacious sound to the album and each band member gets to shine (though it is mainly studio session musicians, not his faithful band). It's not over produced by any means; it just that the songs aren't the best material. Elton wanted to strip the sound down and simply his life (hence he's not even wearing glasses on the cover photo).\nSince this came out in 1978, some of the songs have a slight disco feel (I Don't Care) and Elton was offering a true departure from the excesses of his Captain Fantastic persona just 2 years prior.\nA handful of b-sides were added to this remastered edition of the album and some of them are quite good including three Taupin penned left overs from previous sessions: Ego, Lovesick and I Cry At Night.\nAnd Strangers, a great country song with a satisfying Osbourne lyric that isn't trite, is one of the best Elton and he has ever written.\nA Single Man is worthy of taking a listen. But there are many better Elton John albums to start with first. This album remains a curious piece of work that was produced by an artist unsure of where he fit in the new musical landscape. Though this sold well throughout much of the world when it came out, so much had changed within a few short years of when Elton John was on top. A Single Man found Elton taking a step back to refocus on his place in popular music. And sometimes, you have to take a step back to gain a few steps forward.", "label": 2}

After Meditation\n3.  While falling asleep.\n4.  When Listened to every day, preferable at the same time\n5.  When listened to in conjunction with conscious affirmation.\nIf followed in this way, it is likely that you will see some results.

One thing that cannot be taken away from the self-proclaimed \"King of Pop\" is the fact that he is an excellent entertainer.  American Idol contestants can take a lesson from MJ, but I doubt any of them will duplicate his success or even come close..\n\nStarting in the early 1970's through the late 1990's, The Essential Michael Jackson covers Jackson's hits with the Jackson 5, all on Disc 1, through the Jackson-mania that swept through the early/mid 1980's  with the hit album \"Thriller\", also on Disc 1.  Anyone who feels the need to \"dance to the music\", can easily buy this album and start the moonwalk and more.\n\nDisc 2 is his post-Thriller hits, which didn't quite reach the same level of hysteria, but it's still excellent listening enjoyment.  Sing along or dance to it, Jackson's songs on Disc 2 are a mix of rock, dance and \"rhythym & blues\".  \"Black or White\", Jackson's answer about his skin condition is included, as well as the excellent song, \"Man in the mirror\".\n\nA couple of songs, are not on this CD that I thought should be,  the Mariah Carey covered \"I'll be there\",  and a poignant song of MJ's,  1985's,  \"Gone Too Soon\", a song about the, 15 year old AIDS victim- Ryan White, whose family was terrorized by ignorance.\n\nJackson, unfortunately, has made headlines not with his songs, but with his bizarre behavior.  There's still racism out there, child neglect and a host of other sins.  Jackson could have been reacting to these and only Jackson knows why.  All the while Jackson has managed to come up with a host of likable and danceable pop hits and these songs are and will always be the Essential Michael Jackson.", "label": 1}

His great singing voice coupled with his great songwriting and musicianship means that we Christians should count ourselves blessed that he has chosen to use his gifts for the glory of God.  Many of the tracks on this 35-track double-disc album have been covered by other artistes and his obviously heartfelt renditions of his material totally inspires his listeners and reminds them of God's great love for them.  The only thing that could be inproved upon is the sound quality which could do with some remastering using the modern-day sound technology that is out there.  Otherwise, this is an excellent worship cd and comes very highly recommended.  35 tracks on 2 discs at less than 15 bucks?  If that's not great value, I don't know what is.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Music this past year for me has been sort of blah. There have been a few really good, surprising releases (Tweet) and of course the typical r&b throw away material (Ashanti). So naturally I was shocked to learn that my girl India. Arie was going to be back with a new release. But I had my suspicions, one of which might just turn out to be true. I feel she rush released this album so it could be just in time for the 2003 Grammy Awards. She released it just one week before the album would have been ineligible for Grammy consideration.\n  Though my above speculation may not be the case, I feel that India did rush this album. Either that, or some of these tracks are ones which didn't make the cut for 'Acoustic Soul'. She herself stated that 'Soul' took over two years to create, while 'Voyage' arrived within a two month period. Cathartic though this album may have been for her, it is lacking many of the qualities that we came to love in its predecessor.\n  The album does start off on a good note. 'Little Things' is easily one of the sets highlights (which are few and far between). And just like a true voyage to India may be, the rest of the journey is SLOW between the true gems on the album and the filler. Such highlights of the album include: 'Beautiful Surprise' and 'Get It Together'. However, the most impressive, emotion stirring song is 'Good Man' which was originally from the \"We Were Soldiers\" soundtrack. It has heartfelt lyrics, and the story truly does come alive.\n  The rest of the album sounds too, well just TOO. It's too preachy, too saccharine and sadly too little. It's lacking the edge of the first album. Nowhere on the album will you find anything as uplifting as 'Video', 'Brown Skin' or 'Strength, Courage and Wisdom'. That was the true disappointment.\n  In all, I don't believe this is necessarily a bad release, it's just not what I expected from her. I am confident that the next voyage will bring us fans back home.", "label": 2}

{"text": "That one word tends to summarize the feeling I get when listening to this album. Elton certainly was searching for the right mix of popular trends of the day and traditional hit making formulas that served him well in the beginning.\nThis album came at a very crucial time for Elton. He just bounced back with a solid offering with 1980's 21 @ 33 and it's huge hit \"Little Jeannie\". Fans like myself were very anxious to see what would come next. And while, I like a lot of this album, the parts are better than the whole.\nActually, the first half (before the instrumental, which started side two on LP in the old days) comes right out of the gate surprising strong. And to this day, the first couple of songs hold up pretty well: the rocker \"Breaking Down Barriers\", the blues/rock \"Heart In The Right Place\", the pop fun of \"Just Like Belgium\" and the FM-rocker \"Fascist Faces\". The only notable exception is the Euro-disco \"Nobody Wins\"). But side two, while contains some down right gems, can't seem to hold the album together. After the lush orchestral \"Carla/Etude\" we get a syn-new age \"Fanfare\" which serves as a bridge to the bluesy and wonderful ballad \"Chloe\".\nAt this point, the listener isn't sure whats going to happen - which can be a good thing but not from Elton John. Experimentation is not his strongest suit. The next three songs \"Heels Of The Wind\", \"Elton's Song\" and title track are very different from each other. \"Heels\" hints at a song much better to come, which was called \"I'm Still Standing\". \"Elton's Song\" is a tender and beautiful ballad that seems out of place, much like the songs story of a boy with a crush on another boy. And the title track ends on the album on a country/rock note which may be Bernie Taupin's finest bio of Elton written to date.\nOne of the issues working against this release was David Geffen's rejection of six of the original songs submitted. Afterall, Geffen lured Elton to his then new record label and wanted to make sure he would get his return on investment. Hot producer of the moment Chris Thomas produced half of the album but showed no signs of his brillance on albums just released by The Pretenders or INXS. It would take awhile for Chris to find the right ingredients to bring out the energy in Elton's music.\nDon't get me wrong, \"The Fox\" has some excellent songs and is recommended. But it tries too hard and seems to beg for attention. If the second half of the album wasn't a disjointed, \"The Fox\" may have been the powerhouse it was trying to be.\nBest tracks: Breaking Down Barriers, Chloe, Elton's Song, The Fox.", "label": 2}

It's not up to the level of her previous work. (Car Wheels on A Gravel Road, Sweet Old World, etc.) This isn't in the same league!\n\n2.) It sounds like poetry which was written and then forced to be songs. The lyrics don't work as songs! The music sounds like it was an afterthought.\n\n3.) The lyrics are lame! The song \"What If\" is an embarrassment! It's elementary school level writing. Example lyrics: \"what if cats walked on water and birds had bank accounts\"  or \"if the president wore pink!!!!!!!\" What was she smoking? \"I love you mama you're sweet...I love you mama you're sweet, I love you mama you're sweet.\" MY GOD!

Does this album compare well with their better-known work from their younger years? No, not really, but then perhaps it isn't fair to compare, so let's look at this album on its own. It's fair to say that the band can still play; they were always good musicians. Unfortunately, what I hear here isn't a joyful reunion, but rather a group of solo songs by the band members, thrown together on the same (long) album. The opening track is a suitably raw version of Elvis Costello's \"Doll Revolution,\" which is not one of Costello's best songs, but it's pleasing enough to hear the girls give it a bash. The radio-ready hit \"Something That You Said\" has the slick hook it needs, but the production kind of lets it down; it lacks crucial punch, and Susanna Hoffs' fine voice sounds muted and restrained. Debbi Petersen's \"Stealing Rosemary\" is an intersting song after a few listens. Michael Steele's songs are mostly forgettable dark folk numbers. Indeed, after about four tracks I began to tire of the lack of sonic variety and the dry, modern digital sound of it all; I think the producer needed to give it some warmth somehow.

The music that expelled from my speakers was innovative, original and to put it quite frankly, the best band I have ever heard.  Now fast forward over to 2005, and along comes a band with an unoriginal name such as 'Soilwork'.  To give you a hint of what this band sounds like, imagine the band gathered around A CD burner, burning Creed's album 'Human Clay' onto a blank disk, and then writing the word 'Soilwork' on the once blank cd.  If this isn't a good enough hint for you, then I presume you have an I.Q. below 75.  This is the biggest rip off of Creed I have ever heard, and I have heard quite a bit.  If you cant see that, then you must have gallons of water atop your brain.  It seems as if every riff, beat, bassline and vocal work was stolen from the Gods of Creed and put onto this CD.  If that isn't piracy, then I don't know what is.  I give Jada Pinkett Smith's (Will Smith's wife) band, 'Wicked Wisdom' more credit than the members of Soilwork (who by the way all have trisomy 21).

You Want To Make A Memory, the opening single from Lost Highway is a elequent melloncollie song that reflects on heartbreak and divorce, similar to what Richie Sambora had went through the past couple of years. the song really shines nicely as a down to Earth song that deals with empty and being lonely.

Not that ether effort is to overlooked for the completing projects that they are, but I guess that I had to change my viewpoint as it is clear that MJB has. Often times with music, listeners expect every album that a favorite artist releases to be a carbon copy. I have often criticized others whom have taken this stance, but know I find myself on the opposite spectrum. We are no longer dealing with the Mary of \"What's the 411\" or \"My Life\", and that has taken some getting used to for me. \"Growing Pains\" perfectly illustrates that trend as we can see that she is still growing, and the product is a very cohesive LP.

I bought this album soon after it came out, in 1985, and it took me a full year of listening to truly appreciate its brilliance.  This album represented a quantum leap beyond the simplistic yet still memorable \"Kill 'Em All\"--the lyrics and the themes here are (as one reviewer has already noted) conceptually similar to what Iron Maiden was exploring on their albums \"Piece of Mind\" and \"Powerslave\" and what bands like Black Flag had explored from the start--alienation, fury and destruction.  A true missing link between punk and metal.  \"Fight Fire With Fire\" is absolutely apocolyptic; \"Ride the Lightning\" is relentless (I have always thought of the music on this song as the soundtrack to nightmares), \"Creeping Death\" is outstanding.  Truly a classic.  Strongly recommended for people who think lame bands like System of a Down and Creed are \"rock\"--listen and learn.", "label": 2}
{"text": "The seller's reponse to those who have questions about the representations made for this CD:\n\n\"Seller Response: \"Read the description. \"These recordings were taken from the only known acetate record of the tapes, that were aquired some time ago. They are as they were recorded on Jan. 1, 1962.\"\"  Date: June 21, 2009\n\nActually, as another reviewer noted, Joe Pope offered these for sale during the 1970s-1980s as singles.  He also offered them as an LP, which, having heard it, I noted was pristine in sound: no scratches, no pops, or other defects.\n\nApparently Joe Pope had a second \"only known acetate record of the tapes,\" except that his was pristine.\n\nOtherwise, to clarify as concerns the actual facts:\n\n1.  The audition was with Decca Records, not EMI.  The producer there had the option of choosing one \"guitar group,\" and the other auditioned was \"Brian Poole and the Tremeloes\".  He chose the latter over \"The Beatles\" because they were in London, which was a convenience for the label, whereas \"The Beatles\" had yet to relocate from Liverpool to London.\n\n2.  The audition was not taped; it was recorded direct-to-disk.  (See All You Need is Ears, by George Martin.)\n\n3.  As Decca Records still exists, or is part of the MCA group, it is not likely the sold these valuable recordings to EMI or anyone else.  It is most probable that they contracted with EMI for use of some of them for the \"Anthology\" project, as they knew they would make a sizable profit from it.\n\nIt is one thing to make money from bootlegs -- keeping all 100 per cent of it for oneself -- but quite another to misrepresent, whether by commission or omission, the nature and quality of them in order to sell them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.\n\n1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  \"Reach\" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.\n2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.\n3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.\n4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.\n5) 2 Find U: Weak.\n6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.\n7) Doin' Fine: \"We are what everyone wants to be.\"  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.\n8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is \"spells\" the song title...).\n9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.\n10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.\n11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.\n12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.\n13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).\n14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own \"becoming\" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.\n\nAs you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to \"This Way\") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Ayn Rand wrote some of my favorite books: The Fountain Head and Atlas Shrugged.\n\nBorn at the beginning of the 20th Century Russia, in the beautiful city of St. Petersburg, Ayn Rand started to read from the early age of six. By the age of nine, it is said that she knew she wanted to dedicate her life to writing and to philosophy.\n\nRussia of the times was focused in collectivism, something Ayn Rand despised. After reading the works of Victor Hugo her character starts to shape. She lived through the Kerensky Revolution and in 1917, through the Bolshevik Revolution. From the start, she denounced communism and when the revolutionaries are victorious and start the painstaking process of taking away property, confiscating the pharmacy her father owned, she decides Russia is not the country for her. The family undergoes poverty and lack of food. While at school, during a class of American History, Ayn develops the ardent desire to become an American citizen. The United States becomes her goal because she wants to join a nation of free men and women, where the rights of the individual are protected by its constitution.\n\nThe university where she was studying philosophy is overtaken by communists, but during her last years of study; she enjoys one great pleasure, watching Western films and plays, and decides to enter the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.\n\nFinally, she is permitted to leave Soviet Russia and to visit the United States. Her trip was supposed to last a short time, but she was determined never to return to Russia. New York City, with its skyscrapers, thousand lights, and never ending activity becomes the city that shapes her interpretation of the finest achievements of humanity.\n\nFor a while, following her acting career, she travels to Hollywood and meets Cecil B. DeMille, who offers this striking young woman, with piercing eyes, a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings. Mr. DeMille gives her an opportunity, her first job in the USA, as an extra, a script reader.\n\nShe meets actor Frank O'Connor and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part. She writes The Fountainhead, where she shapes a hero by the name of Howard Roark, an architect, an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how \"a man ought to be.\" She then moves to write Atlas Shrugged, a novel that shares her philosophy through a story, surfacing the concept of objectivism, or how to live on Planet Earth.\n\nPassion is not our favorite view to Ayn Rand. The DVD offers an interpretation of her affair to Nathaniel Branden, but to see how she relates to him and to his wife is sad and almost made us feel that she used her superior wit and intellect to shape these relationships into calculated displays of weak characters. We have always admired Ayn Rand and her marriage to Frank O'Connnor was all we knew about. If all the hypocrisy of this foursome was indeed true, then... as with any hero placed on a pedestal... we found that Ayn Rand did compromise, was unfaithful to her Frank, and was in the end... only human. Frankly, would have rather skipped this film.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Some DJs out there have the simple goal of giving people what they want to hear. The better DJs of this group (Paul Oakenfold, Keoki) know why what's popular works, and do a good job meeting expectations. Other DJs don't care what's popular - they simply find a style that they love and carry the torch for it. The good DJs here (Richie Hawtin, Tony De Vit) are great at converting others to this style.\nSasha falls into neither group, which means that this set is neither a populist-type mix or a excursion into a new style. Therefore, there simply isn't much to talk about here.

{"text": "The prodigy found by Eminem finally gets his album, as his lyrical thoughts and beats are fantastic, something is very artificial about him, like he's not as gangster as he says he is. Yet I'm here to critic the record not him. Some songs stand out and raises the bar for some rappers. This includes Wanksta, Many Men, and Gotta Make to Heaven which seem to release alot of lyrical feeling and thought, while others such as P.I.M.P, 21 Questions, and In Da Club, ground the rapper and instead of reaching a verbal level and skill of Jay-Z, Nas and even Eminem keeps him more at a level of Nelly, P.Diddy or even his arch enemy Ja Rule who try to get their tracks more into the club than listening for lyrical value. The beats are great, some more than others. He loses many for this album from overuse of guns and violence, and loses alot of points for no creativity or originality(anywhere). If 50 works more on his rhymes, than his appeal, He might become one of the hottest and most respected rappers out there.

Most of the songs on here are great -- Adalida, Blue Clear Sky, etc.  Some of them, though, seem custom made for today's pop radio -- One Night at A Time, True, etc.  That's not saying they're not good; George has an incredible ear for  picking a pleasant sounding tune.  It's just not the stuff of Amarillo By  Morning or Ocean Front Property.  We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This does  sort of remind me of the raging fiddle of The Fireman, though, albeit not  as cool.\nAs for the new tracks, I could take or leave Best Day.  It's a  nice song with country styling and gives you a nice feeling if you can  identify with it I guess, but nothing outstanding.  Murder on Music Row is  awesome though.

Interesting, makes your head bounce  (you know how that goes.)\n3. \"Never Wake Up\": It's a very hard tune, it's too fast for me...I CAN'T KEEP UP!!!!!\n4. \"Fat Lip\": I think I'll remember the Summer of 2001 with this song.  It's a head banging tune.  Very singable.  I'm amazed how popular it became.\n5. \"Rhythms\": Reminds me a bit of Blink 182.  It has a cool little guitar intro.  It's a cool punk-y tune.\n6. \"Motivation\": Interesting beginning with the drums.  I can invision the band playing this at a punk club.\n7. \"In Too Deep\": A reminder of Sugar Ray in the earlier days.  Cool tune.\n8. \"Summer\": Doesn't sound like summer whatsoever.  It does sound like 'We're going back to school, don't want to though.'  It could be in a teen movie though.\n9. \"Handle This\":  Another more rock than punk song.  Kinda quiet though during the verses.  Slower than most Sum 41 songs.\n10. \"Crazy Amanda Bunkface\": Now this is punk...(I think.)  Sounds a bit like \"Fat Lip\", but I don't know anything.\n11. \"All She's Got\": Another fast punk/rock song.  Interesting though.  Reminds me of a Civil War song (I don't know why...)\n12. \"Heart Attack\": A \"What's My Age Again\" song.  The guitar intro sounds like it.\n13. \"Pain for Pleasure\": It's at the end of the \"Fat Lip\" video.  It sounds very 1980's-ish.  With the guitars, head-bang tune.\nOverall review: 3 stars:  An impressive debut by a 'pop-punk' group from Canada.  I'm impressed by the quality this band shows.

Mezzanine found me looking for inspired moments within the bass-and-crackle-laden \"thump thump\" of its mostly droning, sickeningly 'deep' little ditties... something I certainly never had to do when listening to 'Blue Lines' or 'Protection'.  I mean, let's face it: trip-hop is dead... Even todays exemplary bands are far too derivative to warrant the attention of anyone who is now old enough (I'm only 20) to have appreciated the earlier stirrings of this ultra-modern trend.  But if you must indulge yourself, 'Blue Lines' and 'Protection' are heady and thick with soul, rhythm, and outright 'groovability' -- not to mention  the lyrics on both ('Blue Lines' being a bit more concretely meditative than its successor), Shara Nelson's voice on the former, and Tracy Thorn's on the latter.\nDespite being, as a whole, merely tolerable, there are half-a-handfull of standouts:  Horace Andy's voice is obnoxious, infectious, and awesome; Liz Frazer, when louder/clearer than a traumatized bunny-wabbit, is haunting and generous... Still, at most, 'Mezzanine' is emotionless (and spare me the whole \"Dude, that's the feeling they were trying to convey...\" argument), brooding in an utterly lame early- to mid-90s way, and thoroughly unoriginal (any maladjusted teenager with a dimming strobe-light, Pro-Tools, and a collection of Suicide and Joy Division albums could have fashioned an album of equal, or more, imagination).\nAlas, though, if currently wetting yourself over the ilk of  recent electronica-cum-trip-hop forays (i.e., Radiohead, latter-day Bjork, etc., etc.) and the according collabrative efforts therebetween (\"cha-chinggg\"), 'Mezzanine' is stocked at the front counter of your nearest college-campus convenience store for your listening delight.\nOr... you could just buy it 'cause it's quicker than Valium.", "label": 0}

{"text": "AC/DC waited way to long to release a live CD.  Brian's voice is shot beyond repair.  I realize at the time of the recording he was 62 or so but man, 30 years of grinding out those songs have left his voice shot and unable to hit anything but the low notes.  Making it even worse is the band is still playing the notes as they always have and haven't brought it down a note or two to compensate for Brian's vocals.  The energy from the band is still there without a doubt but I'd much rather hear a live CD set fromt he Ballbreaker or Stiff Upper Lip DVD's as it sounded much, much better.  The song selection is getting a big old as others have mentioned and it would be nice to hear something like \"Who Made Who or Money Talks\" back in the set.  Aside from that the sound quality is pretty pour as well.  As usual you don't hear a note of Cliff's base and the guitars are turned up enough to drown out everything.  Even Phil's drums sound lost and weak in the mix and don't seem to have as much pop as the other two DVD releases had.  I haven't watched the DVD of this show yet so I'm not sure if the DVD quality is better than than the CD but you certainly can't hide the fact that Brian's voice is broken beyond repair.  Typically you hear the the same tone and the notes played the same from Angus's guitar but in this show he seems to be playing a little off on some of the songs.

Soilwork was known for their catchy, and technical arrangement's, amazing duel guitar playing with intense solo sections, and the great vocals of speed strid. On this album we get very repetitive arrangements, and basic power chord riffs for about 50% of the album. The solos are almost non existent on this album! 5 out of 12 songs have solos, and 2 of the 5 solos were good \"soilwork type\" solos. the others were nothing special. all the melodic melodies in the guitars are gone! I LOVE speeds vocals, but for christs sake your a band not a speed solo album!\n\nnow on a positive note the other 50% of the album is quite good. heavy High energy songs, catchy and awesome riffs. some stand out tracks are stabbing the drama (great heavy opener), one with the flies(classic soilwork! catchy, and a killer solo!), nerve (another catchy as hell song, fear factory influenced!), distance (good chorus, good solo, but it gets repetitive), and blind eye halo(heaviest most aggressive song on the album, sounds like the chainheart era).\n\nthe problem is the other 6 songs that are very hard to sit through. many people say figure number 5 is their worst album, but i disagree.

{"text": "If you're a fan of Ryan Adams and hear critics calling him a copy of 70's singer-songwriters, Jackson Browne is one of them.  This album is overall a nice mellow listen - good for road trips or Saturday morning breakfast music.\nI like Browne's version of \"Take It Easy\", which he co-wrote with the Eagle's Glen Frey, but the song doesn't end, only segues into the next song, \"Our Lady of the Well,\" which can be a bit confusing if you're familiar with the Eagle's version.\nI also like the mellow but moving \"Ready or Not\" and the raucous (for Jackson Browne, that is) \"Redneck Friend.\"\nI own several of JB's works, and usually the JB \"experts\" will point to this as one of his best, if not his best, but I prefer the work on \"Running on Empty\" much more.  Most of the songs on this album sound similar so that \"Redneck Friend\" and \"Take It Easy\" sound like they don't belong.\nIf you're looking to get into JB, get this one to start off with, but make sure you pick up the road classic, \"Running on Empty\" and his early eighties masterpiece, \"Hold Out\" to round out your sampling.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Tears in Heaven is beautiful. That's why I originally bought the CD.

It's purely awful. Period. I'm not a Rick-basher. I have everything he's released since \"Wait for Night\". He's one of my all time favorites, but this is the worst thing he's done that I can remember. Why would he choose these songs to cover. Songs that he supposedly wishes he'd written? Why? At the time that most of these songs were coming out, he was doing stuff far superior to them. It's like Joe Montana saying he wished he could've played as well as Jim McMahon. The instrumentation doesn't deviate from the originals in any notable way, other than sounding completely flat and soulless. Rick's voice sounds so weak, also. Worst is the cover of \"Broken Wings\" by Mr. Mister, where he sings a duet with Richard Page and gets completely shown up vocally. I hate to post this, I really do. But I feel that Rick Springfield fans with some degree of objectivity about themselves must be warned. DON'T buy this thing. Save it for when he puts out a new cd of original songs that better showcase his strengths as a musician. This one showcases his weaknesses, in spectacular fashion. His last two cd's, \"Karma\" and \"Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance were great, but this is a stinker. Beware.", "label": 0}

{"text": "As an avid Jewel fan, I was eagerly anticipating her next studio release. I saw her in Louisville, KY in November 2002 and was hoping that she would release more of her previously unreleased tracks that I heard her perform live. Unfortunately, if she keeps going down this road, that does not seem to be in the cards.\nFirst, I was intrigued by her decision to go all Prince on us--with the \"2\" for \"to,\" \"U\" for \"you,\" you get the picture. Not only is this the format of the track listing, it is also the format of the lyrics in the lyric booklet. However, I thought this could be saved if she stuck with her amazing lyrical abilities.\nAs a CD standing on its own, I would say that this CD would be okay. I might even like it. However, it seems such a departure for the Jewel I know (or thought I knew) and love that the result seems nothing short of horrific. I liked \"Intuition\" when I heard it on the radio for the first time--despite its difference, I found it catchy. The song \"To Find You\" (or is it \"2 Find U\"?) is beautiful, but the rest of the CD somewhat fades into the background noise of techno and dance beats. Some of the songs seem to sink to nauseating Britney Spears-esque levels...for example, in the way-too-cutesy \"Fragile Heart,\" Jewel croons, \"If you want my heart/you have to promise not to tear it apart/'cause my heart/has been hurt a lot.\" Far from the biting social commentary of \"Pieces of You.\"  And, frankly, the presence of a track titled \"U & Me = Love\" frightened me, not to mention the Spice Girls memories recalled by seeing \"2 Become 1\" as a track listing. (Note to reader: as you may have deduced, it is not the same song.)\nThis is definitely only for die-hard Jewel fans who wish to own everything and anything she produces...if you're looking to buy your first Jewel CD, steer away from this one and purchase one of the others. Pure fan loyalty, as I see it, is the only way this CD will sell a respectable number of copies.\nIn short, if you liked \"Intuition,\" buy the single and keep your memories of a kinder, sweeter, folkier Jewel.", "label": 2}

{"text": "It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.\n\nThe first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this \"essential\" collection. Besides the \"Ultimate Collection\" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.\n\nI can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Earth Song\" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think \"Whatever Happens\" should have been here and perhaps \"Butterflies\". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop \"hits\" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  /5.", "label": 1}
{"text": "One should never judge the accomplishments made by an artist based solely on what one reads and sees in the news.  How many singers can honestly say they have been in the spotlight for 3 decades?  Very few can and are around to tell about it.  It is unfortunate that many celebrities are tarnished by their lifestyles but at the same time these people have left a mark on world-wide culture.  Michael Jackson is one such artist.  Beginning in his youth in the 70s, MJ has gone from child performer to adult superstar.  Few people over the age of 30 can deny that they have never heard of the greatest selling album of all time in the world : Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\".  No fewer than 9 of the 11 tracks on the album were hits in the early 80s.  Although his future albums never reached the awesome success seen by Thriller, no one can deny the genius in many of Jackson's recordings.  The Essential Michael Jackson presents just enough of MJ's hits (everything from the J5 to little known songs from the recent past) to satisfy any fan.  However, Say Say Say (a duet MJ had with Paul McCartney) is sorely missing. I have never even run across the album the song was originally released on.  Although we may never again see a resurgence of Michael Jackson mania, listeners can relive what are fabulous songs by a gifted entertainer.", "label": 1}

I think it's actually more than 1 album per year when all the live albums, official live cover bootlegs, solo albums and side projects are counted. One thinks that all these (very very much talented in terms of musicianship) guys are full of ideas coming out like a fountain all the time.. And the frequency of the releases is getting bigger year by year.\n\nPetrucci, is a great guitarist without doubt and what's more, a songwriter for DT, the band that i always adore. there's always been a kind of difference with this band's songwriting quality, even though sometimes virtuosity seems to be one step ahead for the guys themselves. With \"Octavarium\" at last, i really thought that songwriting had taken a real step forward.. And the previous live cd \"Budokan\" was telling that this was coming with all the extra solos that showed not only virtuosity, but also great songwriting and improvisation talent. These two last releases made me think \"wow, the guys really produce so frequently, but they are doing a great job too\"\n\nWhen i heard that Petrucci released a solo album just a few months after the release of \"Octavarium\" and during a World Tour, i said \"when did he record it???\" (Goes for Rudess too, though i haven't heard his CD yet) These guys are really PRODUCTIVE!!\n\nHowever, the album is NOT what i expected from the guy.. I have never thought of him as the ultimate guitar player (He is definitely one of the best, but not Steve Vai..) but after the aforementioned releases from DT, i was hoping that his effort would overcome the now-boring \"Guitar Album\" genre. OK, he's got great melodies, OK he's (no doubt) got talent, but after years of being considered \"one of the best\" (like, say.. satriani, malmsteen, van halen, vinnie moore, stetina, saraceno, friedman, becker, or even macalpine, he should have done something(s) more to step out of the league and stand on his own.\n\nOK, this is just his first solo effort, but he's really in a rush! and the result is yet another satriani/moore album. I'd not die waiting for 2 more years for more refined and distinctive music.. The problem is, Petrucci himself is acting like he's gonna die tomorrow and is trying to produce, whatever he can. Rather than his album, I'd prefer listening to the unheard street guitarist Carlos Vamos's CD i bought from himself in Barcelona where he performed.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity (\"Character\" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.\n\nAfter all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.\n\nThe main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to \"Weapon of Vanity\" and \"Nerve\" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.", "label": 0}

Of course, all the other lame rappers in this day and age use similar two-note orchestral backings for their repetitive topics and subjects. The little kid's comment remains in my head. He's never heard Mr. Lif, Jurassic 5, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Run DMC, or any respectable hip-hop artist. Even the ganja kings of Cypress Hill, and the violent gangstas in N.W.A. are better than this tripe marketed as hip-hop today. Mumbling about girls, money, cars, and guns is really stupid. Really. Trust me. It seems like no one gets it. When Dre did it back on the Chronic, it was tight. It was fresh, and done creatively. He was rapping about an actual lifestyle. It was a party album. 'Fiddy' here probably thinks he's a real gangsta.\nThat's not even the saddest part.\nSo do the kids. They inhale this like air, not knowing any better. They blamed Columbine on Rammstein, and educational decay on the public school system. It's records like these.\nThey also are stinking up radio.

The great weakness of the disc is that the tracks blend facelessly into each other without any jumping out as truly memorable.  Their sound is impressionistic with emphasis on atmosphere and mood, a wonderful rainy day disc.  \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\" is a good example of the aching groove in which the band revels, \"Cause years pass & people change; the bluest skies can turn to grey.\"  \"Boxcar Racer\" has a nice jazz groove and a distinguishable melody & is one of the better tracks.  \"Either Way It Goes\" also gets a bit of energy, \"I didn't mean to let you down, but sometimes even angels hit the ground.\"  Ultimately, Blue Merle show promise and have a nice sound, but now they need to hone their songwriting skills to make tracks that stick in the memory.

{"text": "It seems every year there' s a whole stack of new Christmas collections coming out for us the general public to purchase. Most of them are basically just rehashed and repackaged collections of the same old songs we've heard on previous years collections. Within that tall stack of CD's there's always a couple of fun gems that turn up. Which is the story of Merry Mixmas from Capitol Records. It's an excellent collection of Christmas Classics remixed by the hottest remix artists out there. Of course these tracks are all available on Capitols Christmas Cocktails CD collections volumes 1 - 3 in their original forms. This CD basically collects the best tracks from those CD's and offers them on one CD in the hot remixed format.\n\nThe CD starts fairly slow with a Bent Remix of Winter Wonderland by Bing Crosby. This remix sounds so good it doesn't really sound like a remix as it keeps the elements of the original track in this version and it feels like nothings really remixed or done to this track. It's a nice way to start a Christmas CD a slower paced track and build up to the more upbeat versions later on in the collection.\n\nUp next is a fun and lively remix of Nat King Cole's All I Want For Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth) by MJ Cole. I think MJ Cole has come up with an excellent remix of this classic track which utilizes all of the great vocals with an updated sound but keeping that great retro feel of the original version.\n\nDean Martin's Baby It's Cold Outside remix by ARP is what follows next. Again with this remix it feels like the original version but there's that added extra beat that the original didn't have. It's quite nicely done by ARP.\n\nThe Latin Project have done a wonderful remix of Ella Fitzgerald's Sleigh Ride by giving it a Latin mid-tempo vibe to it. Ella Fitzgerald's vocals sound so good within a remix as we've heard in the Verve Remixed series and this track is another winner as far as remixes of Ella Fitzgerald tracks go. Next up should be a whole collection of Ella's classics on one CD.\n\nWhat comes next is one of the better remixes on this collection. Santa Baby remixed by Alexkid & DJ Sleep and sung by the original Catwoman herself Eartha Kitt. This track actually feels like a remix which is what this collection is supposed to be a Christmas CD of remixes. The beatz, clicks and bass just move along with lovely Eartha's voice. That classic track is sung so perfectly by Miss Eartha Kitt. The remix still has elements of the original but it's quite good what Alexkid & DJ Sleep have done. Perfected it for the Remix Generation.\n\nUp next is a mellow chill remix of Lou Rawl's Have Yourself A Merry Christmas by awayTeam. It's a lovely track with fun electronic sounds and cute beats mixed in with his original vocals.\n\nLena Horn's Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! remixed by Suedojazz fades up to full effect with the beats already in progress.  Lena's vocals immediately start up and the jazzy reworked track takes full effect. This remix clocks in at two minutes and fifty five seconds and it's a groovy upbeat reworking of the original. Fun and to the point as it's quite short.\n\nMalibu have done a hip and quirky update to Billy May's Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer Mambo by adding the cute vocal snippets to the track. This version pretty much stays true to it's original form except for the added beats, vocals and record scratches by Malibu.\n\nOnto the next track we have Kay Starr's (Everybody's Waiting For) The Man With The Bag remixed by Thunderball. Thunderball are known for releasing loungy downbeat electronica and this track was the perfect choice for them to remix. The beats are loud and Kay's vocals complement them perfectly.\n\nPsapp's Lady Remix of I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm by Les Brown & Band is another quick and to the point remix of a classic Chrstmas tune. This version has the upbeat Big Band groove with the great female vocals. I like how they have incorporated the sounds of casino tables into the track. I think those sound effects work great with this track.\n\nFatman Is Coming, Fatman Is Coming yell out the backing vocals in Johnny Mercer's Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town remixed by Q-Burns Abstract Message. The version has been given a big bouncy beat feel to the track and feels more like a remix rather an update to the original track.\n\nNancy Wilson's upbeat reworking of The Christmas Waltz by awayTeam is quite different in feel compared to Lou Rawl's more relaxed and laidback reworking of Have Yourself A Merry Christmas. This track has the big beats and the cute Christmas feel and charm of yesteryear.\n\nUrsula 1000's remix of Julie London's I'd Like You For Christmas has been given the upbeat energy as the original is quite mellow and it's one of my favorites. Ursula 1000 is known for producing retro sounding loungy electronic music and this remix sure sounds like it's right up his alley. It's a hip swinging remix.\n\nThe Merriest by June Christy remixed by Thunderball is another fun upbeat energetic remix of the wonderful track. It has the Big Band samples, the beautiful vocals of June Christies and Thunderballs excellent production and remix skills. This one of the better remixes on this set.\n\nFinally we are up to the last track on this collection and it's Vince Guaraldi Trio's Christmas Time Is Here by remixed by Markus Enochson. This unfortunately is one of the weaker remixes and I was hoping this collection would close on a bang but it's unfortunately a bust!\n\nOverall Merry Mixmas is a fun CD. It has great classic Christmas tracks updated and remixed by top Electronic musicians and remixer's. Unfortunately most of the remixes don't really feel like remixes and they are quite short in length. I was hoping to totally fall in love with this collection like I have with other remix collections in the past for example like the Verve Remixed collection but this collection is 50 percent great and 50 percent just ok.\n\nSJ\n\n[...]", "label": 2}

To date, I would have to say it is the definitive Michael Jackson collection. It has something from each period in Michael's career... from his origins as a star with the Jackson Five to his last studio album, Invincible.\n\n I think the tracks selected for this album are a very good representation of MJ's career. I do disagree with a few of the tracks, and feel that they should have been replaced with other songs. \"I'll Be There,\" \"Scream,\" \"Butterflies,\" and \"We've Had Enough\" would have made nice additions. There are indeed a couple of non-singles appearing on this collection, which is a bit interesting. Nevertheless, this is probably the one Michael Jackson album to have. It spans his entire career and does it with a great selection of songs. If you're looking for one Michael Jackson album to purchase, I'd reccomend this one.", "label": 1}

Still a decent outing, but it showed that he needed work to get to the status he enjoyed in the 70's.

{"text": "...there is a missed opportunity here.  Unlike some other publishers of historic military music who recognize the value of text information on the music, PzG has produced a thinly packaged item here.  The liner notes consist of a list of the titles on the CD, plus a \"bonus\"  lyric sheet (in both German and loosely translated into English)on the inside cover.  The issue there is that the lyrics are only for one song, \"Wir fahren gegen Engeland\".  It's a famous tune, and it's nice to have that.  Unhappily that is nearly the extent of the liner notes.  There is no info on the original recordings - where and when they were made, who recorded them originally, historic significance of a particular piece, etc.  I reckon you can Google it if you really want to know about it !\n\nYou do get a nice U-boat illustration on the front cover, and a miniature historic photo on the back, along with a cheesy promo shot of PzG's owner, Mr. Kelly - and his dog.  The micro-font text used for the track listing there is also less than helpful.  Perhaps this was all miniaturized from an LP and the liner notes inside went missing in the transition...?\n\nThe music itself is fine.  The historic recordings are apparently reproduced without the benefit of remastering technology ( but I can't speak conclusively here, as there are no liner notes !).  The glorious (or not - depending on your perspective) sound of 1930s/1940s recordings is there for the listener.  It is, to the best of my knowledge, a fairly complete review of the best known German Navy tunes of WWII.\n\nSince my primary interest is in the history here, and the music is contextual, I'm not disturbed by the sound quality.  I don't expect to have to do my own research on provenance and production of the original songs however.  For what seems an egregious oversight in this CD product, I'll avoid PzG CDs in the future.", "label": 0}

And a lot of the result sounds unfinished, and thinly arranged in places.

In ten years when they start releasing compilation cds of rap songs from the early 2000s, they'll put a song by 50 Cent on it, and people will be saying, \"Oh yeah, 50 Cent. Remember when everyone thought he was so great?\"In two years from now he'll be all but forgotten while the next rap star of the moment will come along to replace him. 50 Cent is only popular now because of MTV, pop radio, and marketing. I'd rather listen to Celine Dion...and i HATE, HATE, HATE her music. That's how badly i dislike 50 Cent. Anyone who would spend money on a 50 Cent cd is stupid.", "label": 0}

There's only a handful of actual songs (3-4) while the rest is just endless, looping jams. The lyrics sound like they're all out of the big songbook of cliches, too. Jams are a copout. A bands debut studio album should be packed to the brim with well crafted songs since they've had so much time to write them. Jamming should be saved for live performances. While Robert is religious he also must be somewhat of an ego-maniac to think that I would want to hear endless soloing on a lap-steel. Not to mention the out-of-tune nature of the instrument can be distracting.\nNevertheless, it's much better than your standard fare of offerings.

When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world.

I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is \"Butterfly.\" This song stood out on the Red Star Sounds compilation album. Sadly, this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original. Instead of a strong, punctuating beat to accompany some good lyrics from the original, the new version slows to a crawl and never builds the momentum of the original. The Christmas Song with Stevie Wonder is nothing more than filler.\nIndia's messages just do not resonate with me on this album. She actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album, while this album is very idealistic and overly positive.\nHopefully she will make more classics like Brown Skin, Back to the Middle, Video, and Nature in the future.", "label": 0}

Consider the following:\n1) He is a poor rapper.  His rapping style is exactly the same as Mase (who I also despise), meaning it is boring, void of all emotion, and monotonous, not to mention his irritating mushmouth syndrome.  ENUNCIATE!\n2) Tired material.  Good lord, haven't we all heard this material a million times before, by a hundred different rappers, almost all of whom did it better?  If you don't have anything new to say, just do us all a favor and don't open your mouth in the first place.\n3) Tired image.  Rappers wallowing in an image of drug dealing, strapping gats, and mysogyny is overplayed and rather trite these days.  Yet, instead of coming up with an original image, 50 is once again beating a dead horse, just like everything else in his \"career\"... somebody else did it first, and did it better.\nI think it is painfully obvious that if not for Eminem and Dre, 50 Cent would not be anywhere near a recording studio.  He doesn't deserve to have a record, considering how depressingly unimaginative it is.  If recycled, paint-by-numbers hip-hop is your thing, by all means buy this waste of plastic.

{"text": "Here's a thrilling performance of a beloved classic (especially for young people) -- a work that still deserves respect and one that has probably introduced as many listeners to classical music as Dvorak's New World Symphony and Beethoven's 5th. The colorful orchestration has been greatly admired over the years as brilliant and evocative, including by Igor Stravinsky. The problem I have is with the questionable engineering. The acoustics (in some places) do not sound natural like that of the concert hall but an echoey, reverberant, artificial effect that has been added, like one too many glasses of vodka (and I like vodka). I find it hard to imagine that anyone could put up with this if they were truly listening to the distortions in the sound. It's also like adding lushness to what is already the natural lushness of the exotic score. It also noticeably blurs, perhaps even distorts the texture because the reverberations are colliding with each other,  especially when I'm listening through my favorite headphones and find the irritating effects more pronounced. Too bad. But the performance itself is magical, convincing and Russian rather than the homogenized and blandly generic versions that are usually offered by orchestras that take this exhilarating carpet ride for granted. After all, Scheherazade has her life on the line and there should be a little edge to the performance! No mistake here with Gergiev, though. If I'm lucky - and if it's possible - the performance will be re-mastered and I won't have to howl in agony to give it another hearing, not over the fate of the wise and beautiful Scheherazade threatened by impending death, but because the King was not around to put me out of my sonic misery from the echo chamber from hell engineering. It's that bad, and it's hard to imagine Gergiev approving of it, though I suppose it's possible.", "label": 2}

However, that's all I find good about this CD, besides the two best songs, \"Fallen\", and \"World On Fire\".\nIt's just like \"Surfacing\", only much more boring. Sarah never seems to take risks with her music, she sticks with a tried-and-true formula of bland ballads and the same old lyrical themes (although quite pretty at times). Even her lyrics, though, such as on \"Stupid\", \"Train Wreck\", and \"Push\", among many others, I find WAY too wordy, like she's trying to sound more poetic than she actually is.\nIt's a nice album, better than most of the pathetic mainstream out there lately, but it's very, very boring. I think Sarah should try something new besides all these sleepy melodies and songs. Variety is the spice of music, not just life.\nDon't buy this, buy \"Surfacing\" instead.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nMy overall favourite recording of these dances is the one issued in 1985 by Hungaroton involving Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. (N.B. This recording by Hungaroton is different from the one made by the same performers for Phillips in 1999. To my surprise, the older recording from Hungaroton sounds better than the newer one by Phillips. Who would have thought that 14 years would make a difference?)\n\nThe recording for Phillips (now issued by Eloquence) of the Hungarian Dances with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhausorchester is surprisingly good and it's my favourite recording of the dances by a non-Hungarian orchestra.", "label": 2}

The first five songs are solid, my favorites being \"Marvelous Things\" and \"Golly Sandra.\"  As the album wears on, though, I get very weary and have a hard time listening.  The music sounds all the same, because the production is all very clean and rarely varies to change up the sound.  The girls are good singers, yes, but the lyrics don't really possess any kind of depth that makes me want to listen to what they have to say.  Themes of childhood and innocence and fantasy abound, but they are unfocused and fuzzy at best, often times coming across as though the lyrics were not worked on too much in the writing process.\n\nSo, while there is some catchy ear candy here, it gets to be too much a little before halfway through the album.  I would suggest (if you want something that sounds like this) instead to buy something by Sixpence None the Richer, who have a good singer, plus excellent songs and well-thought-out lyrics.\n\nYeah, so sorry to be one of the few to not fall in love with Eisley.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" sounds like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket.\n\nThat is NOT what this recording is.\n\nThe \"melody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on November 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down the recording, yourself. Which I did. The result is interesting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sings\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.)\n\nGranted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by such saccharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recording of crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest.\n\nIf you have purchased this recording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled. I'll leave it to readers (or listeners) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate.", "label": 0}

I don't care for this much.\nThe most annoying thing I think is that his tone is aweful with the orchestra.  It sounds like someone is strangling a cat in the middle of an orchestra. I've come to the conclusion that electric guitars should not be played as a lead over an orchestra. If he did this whole album with an accoustic I might actually be able to listen to it.  For instance, the songs Prelude to April and Tocatta are accoustic and are actually nice.  In my opinion they are the highlight of the album.\nIn terms of originality, for the most part it is standard Yngwie shred -- same licks he's played for years, but just over an orchestra. There is some variance in a few songs but I long for something new.\nMy opinion is if you are a classical music lover (in addition to hard rock), you will discard this because it is annoying. If you really love Ynwie and like the variation of having an orchestra behind his shred, then rock on.", "label": 0}

Everything works in this song.\n\n5. In Da Club - 4.5/5 - Good song to blast in your car (well, maybe back in 2003). Still, it's a good song 3 years later. My little problem is 50 is hard to understand in parts of the song.\n\n6. High All The Time - 3.5/5 - Good, but not great, song. As a side note, 50 admits in interviews to not smoking so how exactly does he get high all the time?\n\n7. Heat - 4/5 - Gets mindnumbing in spots, but a great beat saves the song.\n\n8. If I Can't - 4/5 - Good song. Gets boring in a hurry though.\n\n9. Blood Hound - 2/5 - This song sucks. Just plain annoying. Young Buck isn't very good either.\n\n10. Back Down - 5/5 - Great Ja Rule diss. Especially the ending. Hahahaha.\n\n11. P.I.M.P. - 2.5/5 - Great song to play if in your at a party, but otherwise it's just an overrated and overplayed radio single. Gets old real fast.\n\n12. Like My Style - 3/5 - Okay song, although Yayo doesn't do very much and 50 doesn't rap very well. Easily skippable.\n\n13. Poor Lil Rich - 1/5 - 50 sucks on this song, the beat is whack, and it's just plain annoying. Boo!\n\n14. 21 Questions - 4.5/5 - Pretty good song. Nate Dogg does a very good chorus. Even though it was way overplayed, it's very catchy.\n\n15. Don't Push Me - 5/5 - The best member of G-Unit Lloyd Banks and Eminem drop amazing verses. 50 also does a great chorus and a great verse. Cool song.\n\n16. Gotta Make It To Heaven - 1/5 - Worst song on the CD. I can't even get through 30 seconds of the song it's so bad.\n\nOverall: 3.6/5\n\nBonus Cuts:\n\n17. Wanksta - 5/5 - Great song to play in your car. 50 has a great flow.\n\n18. U Not Like Me - 2/5 - Annoying and stupid. The only good part is the opening.\n\n19. Life's Life On The Line - 5/5 - Great song. One of 50's best.\n\nTo sum up, GRODT has some very good tracks but some really bad filler mixed in.

I must admit that this version of the Beaux Arts Trio is dull at times. The piano fades away in parts that does not seem right to me. I am no piano player (I took lessons too long ago) but I have a well trained musical ear and the balance of volume between each instrument is rather sloppy to me. Although the overall CD set may be a good bargain, it leaves me unsatisfied. I want better. Also worth mentioning: the heavy breathing of the violin player in certain pieces is far too audible and can be very distracting.

In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.\n\nThe international version of \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:\n\n1. The Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" replaces \"Enjoy Yourself\" (an improvement);\n2. Somehow \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" (from \"Bad\") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the \"Thriller\" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;\n3. The title track from \"Dangerous\" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's \"HIStory\" second CD of new material are added (\"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although \"Earth Song\" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How \"They Don't Care About Us\" ended up on the \"essential\" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).\n\nWould I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover).

{"text": "Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.\n\nThe group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.\n\nThe disc starts off with the rock anthem \"What This World Needs.\"  Think \"If We are the Body\" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.\n\nThe title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, \"Somewhere in the Middle.\"  In fact, the phrase \"between the altar and the door\" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.\n\nAs with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with \"I Know You're There\" and \"All Because of Jesus,\" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.\n\nMy two favorite songs are back to back.  \"Slow Fade\" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing \"Because Little Eyes.\"  It's enough to give me chills.\n\nAppropriately enough, the next song is \"East to West.\"  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.\n\nMusically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is BOC on beyond their last legs, making their last major label album and heading straight for the over the hill circuit. This album sounds even worse to me today than it did in '89. Come on now, we all know a group has  had it when they start re-recording their own songs(usually means they  can't write quality new ones).The reason they give for this is that they  were a part of some great lost conceptualized work that the record label  wouldn't let them do way back when(yeah, yeah,yeah). From what I'm told  this was originally supposed to be an Albert Bouchard solo album, hence the  million guests guitarists. That brings up another point, with a great  guitarist like Roeser, why did you need any of those guys(Satriani, Aldo  Nova, Robby Krieger[and what exactly did they do anyway])The label probably  made them call it a BOC album, or they wouldn't have let it come out.  Hardly anyone is even on their right instrument(ie the one they play live).  Stick with the original classic records(debut through Fire Of Unknown  Origin).", "label": 0}
{"text": "While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the \"King of Pop\". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.\n\nOverall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B 1/2+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: B+\n\nOverall: B 1/2+", "label": 1}

In contrast, Promised Land is much darker, more brooding and certainly less mainstream (arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever released). And that's a good thing right? Well, not necessarily.\nThe fact that this is boring. Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent. I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it.\nThe fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention. It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP, the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime. It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order.\nFor an album that took 2 years to write and record, Queensryche don't have a lot to show for it.

{"text": "Let me just say that I think James Cotton is one of the greats as well as Carey Bell and Junior Wells. I don't know much about Billy Branch and I don't care. This record in terms of blues power has maybe 2 good ones, and a very big maybe- 4 tops. It would seem like a great album by reading the credits but this just didn't go down right. I can't insult these guys as great players but this just gets old real real quick and it is nowhere near what these guys can do individually.  Sometimes these all-star jams produce something far greater than each player-here the depth is just lost. Lucky Peterson Plays on it and though he has great technical skill, is real low on taste and soul here it seems to me. As for the fun side of it- it wears thin for me and I rarely take it off my shelf. Out of about 3 or 4 hundred recordings in my collection- this I take out one of the least. And that is just for a fine rendition of Black Night by Cotton. This just didn't work I am sorry to say. I would strongly recommend that you hear 4 or 5 of these tracks before shelling out a ridiculous amount of money to buy the cd. I just can't say that this record is worth it at all. A solo album by one of these fellas would be more worth the while. It is just mostly songs that don't stand up to the passing of time like an old Howlin' Wolf record is. I just don't care for it and think you are better off somewhere else. If you want a recommendation for a great find than here are two of my favorites of all time : West Side Soul, by Magic Same Maghett and T-Bone Blues, by T-Bone Walker. This is just a fluke in these guys careers I think.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The production of this album is top notch and the band stays true to heavy fuqqn METAL but there isn't a whole lot that grabs you here. The title track is heavy but a slow dirge. Some other songs come off speedy and pounding but the rest of the album is pretty forgetable.\n\nFORGED IN FIRE is without a doubt, one the top ten METAL albums of all time and flattens some of the stuff by METALLICA, SLAYER, MEGADETH & most of ANTHRAX - there I said and I meant it. But unfortunately, the glory days of ANVIL are behind them and after 13 albums, they have been reduced to playing in ditch holes in some slum neighborhood of Eastern Europe and being screwed by the club owners. Perhaps Steve & Rob should move to JAPAN or SWEDEN were they will draw a much larger crowd in a more open venue and they deserve that. Both guys are real good men and their hearts are in the right place but for a multitude of reasons, they will never be a headline act drawing over 10G of fans. They just don't have that same magic possessed by Metallica & Slayer.\n\nLuckily, I met and viewed the performance of the band twice in NY and I will always be a dedicated fan of their music. They should focus on creating songs more in tuned to some of their really heavy and fast stuff they have done through the years but that will not guarantee a headline success they think they deserve.

The first thing i want to clear up is that these guys don t sound that much like Blink 182.  I have been a HUGE Blink fan (and of Punk in general) since they released dammit in spring/summer 97.  Because i live in East middle of nowhere Connecticut, i never got the chance to hear M&Ms or Wasting Time on the radio, but i really wish i had. Anyway, this cd is neither the emotionally-driven, \"tired of being dumped,\" real teenage humor sound of the early blink stuff, the real punk sound of dude ranch, or the pop-punk sound of Enema and Take Off and the Mark Tom and Travis Show, it just is something i dunno what.  I lost the CD as well as many others a while back, so i m trying to remember as best i can.  Intro. to destruction is retarded in a nutshell, so is pain for pleasure.  Basically, i would just skip ahead to Fat Lip, #4, and listen from then on, so i don't remember much of the lower track nums. but i remember they were weird.  Fat Lip was a really awesome song when i first heard it in June 2001, and i immediately got this album. Motivation and Crazy Amanda Bunkface were the only real punk songs other than Fat Lip. In too Deep was ok, but really didn't know what to call it, but the Sugar Ray thing other people said is true.  Summer was another one of my favorite songs, i don t really know why, but it sounded kinda familiar to me.  Handle This had a real cool guitar/precussion intro. although it wasn't punk.  That sounded kinda 70s rock to me.  To \"Sum\" (hahaha) it up (that was pretty lame i know) this album was not Blink 182 at all, but the punk songs on it were Green Day like, and the other stuff was just alternative rock, not punk.", "label": 2}

Starting with some great Jackson 5 songs like \"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\" and \"Rockin Robin\", you are in awe at how talented little Michael is with that huge voice as a child. You wish you were around when he was singing with the Jackson 5! After the Jackson 5 songs, you get a very good taste of some great work at the beginning of Michael's solo career like \"Ben\" and a couple from The Jacksons. Several great songs that never got alot of airplay but are just as fabulous are \"Off the Wall\" and \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground). Of course who can not like some of his Thriller Hits, \"Human Nature\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", we've all heard these songs a hundred times before. The version of \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" is short-barely 4 minutes when the orginal is six minutes...so that irritated me. Another song that is great but never made it to number one is \"Another Part of Me\" also used in the Captain EO film at Disneyland, which we have all seen as kids. Two songs I have never really liked are \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" and \"Leave Me Alone\" are both on here and on the sleeve there is a mistake-they were not recorded in 1982. \"Smooth Criminal\" is the same as the version on \"Number Ones\",, the radio edit. However, songs from one of my favorite albums, \"Dangerous\" make this album even better. The sexy \"Dangerous\" is in full-form, beautiful \"Heal the World\", \"Remember the Time\" and \"Will You Be There\" are more examples of Michael's great and diverse work. Unfortunately, \"Jam\" and \"Earth song\" (also from \"Dangerous\") are missing along with a couple of his better songs off of his last solo release, \"Invincible\", with the exception of \"You Rock My World.\" All in all, this CD is better than \"Number Ones\" because it has alot of less-known great songs from both MJ and the Jacksons, and also several of the ones that went to Number One.

Don't get me wrong, a gem here and there can be found on Get Rich Or Die Tryin', but this isn't classic by any means.\nThe way I see it, half the album is hot, half filler material, but even on the filler material, 50 presents one of the hottest flows this industry has experienced in years it seems.  That's what makes this guy so special when he's on the mic.  Sure this guy isn't a Canibus, or Chino XL, but who in today's game has a higher level of mic presence?\nAll in all, 50 Cent could have pushed out a better album, and I doubt his next album will be any better, but this album is worth the money you pay for it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The CD \"Keep Moving On\" was originally released on the Wounded Bird label in 1969 and, like \"In My Own Dream\" has been re-released without remastering in 2002.  In just one year since the band's last recording, it was beginning the first of many personnel changes that would follow.  Fred Beckmeier and Rod Hicks replaced Bugsy Maugh on the bass, Howard Buzzy Feiten replaced Elvin Bishop on guitar, the piano of Ted Harris and Jerry Ragovoy replaced Al Kooper's organ and Steve Madaio replaced Keith Johnson on the trumpet. The only members to remain in the band in addition to Paul Butterfield were Brother Gene Dinwiddie on various instruments, Keith Johnson on trumpet, David Sanborn on sax and Phillip Wilson on drums.  These changes resulted in a larger and fuller sounding brass section and a de-emphasis on the guitar solos made prominent by Elvin Bishop.  All that would change later with the addition of Mike Bloomfield.  The CD opens with a rather silly number called \"Love March\".  How Butterfield ever thought should be included is a mystery but I guess that was the 60's.  Another noticeable change is that rather than alternating the vocal duties between four different band members, the vocals are largely carried by either Rod Hicks of Paul Butterfield.  As such, the band was starting to form an identity with listeners.  The result is a step above \"In My Own Dream\" but the disc still doesn't match up to \"East-West\", \"An Anthology-The Elektra Years\" or even, \"The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "I agree 100% with the reviewer Leanne (\"Way Too Scary Vocabulary\")  I was so excited to find a product that appeared to be a fun, hilarious,  family-friendly way to expand my children's vocabulary.  I started playing them in the car for my son (9) and daughter (12). The words were not too difficult for them, but the material on the CD got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was related to the author's dating/sex life, or just sex in general.  My kids said that they only remembered the stories and not the words. After going through the first CD, I was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate. I got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious content to censor.  I listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness I quit when I did because she started talking about this date she had in high school where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach!  I guess I'm like my kids because I don't remember what word she was trying to teach us, but I sure remember the story.  When the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author, Ms. Mazur replied that she doesn't think the content was any worse than what is on television - well, she's right, but television in 2007 is a whole lot different than \"I Love Lucy.\"  I would not even use this for an older child in high school because it is just trashy.\n\nInstead of listening to this CD, I'm just going to continue to read good literature to my kids aloud.

{"text": "Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the \"Off The Wall\" & \"Thriller\" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the \"Bad\" singles..the only one that was missing is \"Liberian Girl\" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from \"Dangerous\" are here besides \"Jam\". I am not sure why the title cut \"Dangerous\" included. That should of been where \"Jam\" should of been. Also the final single from the \"Dangerous\" album is not included \"Gone Too Soon\". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song \"History\" & One song from \"Invincible\"? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood?

{"text": "Word of mouth and buzz helped make \"Menopause\" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case for this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or \"Capitol Steps\"/\"SNL\"/\"Mad TV\" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, watered down, and weak.  For \"My Husband Sleeps Tonight\", a parody of the cringey oldie \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback \"What's Love Got to Do with It?\".  That almost defeats the purpose.\nMost men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, weight gain, wobbly temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children.\nFor the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's \"Rutland Weekend Television\", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.  Hopefully, they'll all release their own editions.\nThere have been two annual sold-out residencies to date in my town (and maybe yours as well), and it's always a rave.

Such songs as \"Story of Your Bones\" and \"Listen\" demonstrate the strength of her voice. Nothing like the fiddle scraping, tears to my ears \"Fifty Cent Lovin\".

They only needed to allow about half a second more to have the entire thing, but as it is it's obvious that it's been cut off.

{"text": "XXX is an unusually mixed affair from the veteran band Chicago.  The first six songs are right out of their mid-eighties, David Foster period.  Most are fairly bland pop and pop-ballad tunes and are largely unmemorable.  Exceptions are the lead single \"Feel,\" which is much better in its end-of-album \"horns\" mix and the cool Joseph Williams harmonies on the second song.  Up through the first six songs, it sounds as if the band has played their safest hand.  From there forward, it gets much more interesting.  Robert Lamm's \"90 Degrees . . .\" is a wonderfully twisted tune with a fun, fusion-ish section in the middle.  It's the closest thing to old Chicago on the album.  Bill Champlin's \"Already Gone\" and \"Better\" are both interesting soul-rockers with some good changes and melodic but not cliched melodies.  With some re-sequencing and 1-2 fewer slow songs, this might have been a true return to form.  Production by Rascal Flatts' Jay DeMarcus is ultra-modern and largely unobtrusive.  The exception, however, are the overly produced drum tracks on \"Feel\" which are way overdone.  With a marvelous drummer like Tris Imboden in the band, just let him do his thing and record it accurately.  Both Robert Lamm's \"Subtlety and Passion\" and Bill Champlin's \"Hip Li'l Dreams\" are stronger albums than is XXX.", "label": 2}

He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr. J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing.

{"text": "First let me say I am not a die hard JLT fan. Only recently have I started looking at his catalogue and buying his solo albums. I was impressed enough with his solo projects of the last ten years and I know him from Fandango, Rainbow, Deep Purple and Mother's Army, so I decided to check out this album too.\n\nThe strong points are the energy in the music and the vocals. As on no other album I have heard, Joe Lynn Turner can really hit the high notes. He does some classic 80s screams along with his usual style of power vocals. Each song is charged with energy, making every effort to show the music world that JLT could put out an album that should have made more people notice.\n\nFor my taste, however, the album uses too much synthesizer, which is the dominant instrument on the album. It sounds really like 80s power pop rather than a hard rock album like we are used to hearing on almost every other album JLT has done. Also, I find there is little variety on the album. For the most part any song will suffice as an example of JLT's work here. Listening to the whole album I think it makes great background or driving music, but it's not an album that makes me look forward to the next track and the next.\n\nYou have to realize that this album does sound very different from his other works. But if you are a true fan of Joe Lynn Turner or this style of music then you will appreciate the album.", "label": 2}

That said, just because I am a diehard doesnt mean I will like everything Rick does (not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does, but MANY do).  Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...\n\nThis is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid \"ho hum\".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits \"as performed by ____\" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made \"I've Done Everything For You\" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.\n\nThe one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.\n\n(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)", "label": 2}

I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well...it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't. It's a solo album by BOC's drummer, Albert Bouchard, and seems to be an attempt at a \"rock opera\". Despite the efforts of musicians such as Joe Satriani and Robbie Krieger, the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another. The rather pointless re-do of \"Astronomy\" seems to indicate that there wasn't enough material to work with. And if you're going to call this a BOC album, you've gotta have Buck Dharma, who gets short shrift here. The word is that the record company insisted that IMAGINOS be released as a Blue Oyster Cult album, apparently realizing that this material wasn't going to be too saleable on its own. The album is not a total disaster (I kind of like the Baron Frankenstein number), but I'm very glad that I didn't pay $100.00 for it on eBay!

It is a different experience for sure, as we see flaws healed through the word, and our own spirits gently nudged toward being better.\n\nMessage-wise, this album is just as fantastic as ever. Reading the biblical verses attached to the lyric sheets is a great opportunity for spiritual growth, and can help grasp hold of the lessons that the songs are teaching. If anything, this album is a guide to discipleship. It teaches very well how to be a living example of the power of faith. The messages in this album are significantly more coherent than in the first two albums. Many of the songs focus on letting yourself live by faith, and being careful not to let the teachings of the altar leave you by the time you reach the door.\n\nMusically, this album is caught somewhere in the middle of Casting Crowns and Lifesong. In the first album, lightning struck 6 times, and then the back half of the album was essentially dead. In Lifesong, lightning struck 11 straight times. And even though the best tracks were not quite at the same level as on the first album, I have never heard a stronger second half of an album from any group of any genre. Every single song was inspired, taught a meaningful lesson, pulled your mind into a higher level of reality, and had music that stuck with you. Here, what we have is something halfway in-between. The title tracks are excellent, yet not quite as good as their previous smash hits in my opinion, and the back half of the album is still very good, but not quite as good as Lifesong's. Yet they are still meaningful and fun to listen to, unlike the bleakness of the original's balk half. So, here are my thoughts on each song, to further express my points:\n\nEDITS: now that I've had this album for a while, and had time to really live with the music, the ratings and words are updated. A few of the songs have grown on me, and others haven't.\n\n1. What this World Needs - 8.5/10\nThe message of this song is very good: to keep from strapping our own views on to the Gospels. It expresses the biggest problem with the church nowadays. People are so intimidated by the preaching of false teachers that they reject the church altogether. The melody is fairly good, but this song is all about the message, and it's a good one. The words really stick in your mind, and remind you that discipleship isn't about you, it's about Jesus.\n\n2. Every Man - 10/10\n\"Every Man\" gets the award for best melody on this CD. After the first listening, this was the first song that I went back to. It begins simple, with a cry from the world, then gets more intense as it proclaims \"Is there hope for every man?\" and finally ends with a touching, almost a-capella moment stating that there is hope... in Jesus. The message isn't the focus here, but the musical parts are fantastic. It's tied for my favorite track with \"Slow Fade\" and \"East to West\".\n\n3. Slow Fade - 10/10\nThis song's words are sensational; reminding us that we do not crumble in a day... it is by a series of gradual compromises that we fade from living with God's purpose for us into the grey territory of worldly distraction. It is a message to constantly be vigilant, examining, staying alert to where we are and where we need to be. The melody isn't as good as the previous song, but by the sheer power of the lyrics, it really grows on you fast. Fantastic stuff here.\n\n4. East to West - 10+/10\nThis song is the pinnacle of the album. The message is quite interesting. Although you have been born again, and are without sin in the eyes of God, guilt can overtake you and make you feel unworthy and on the brink of losing salvation. The great message to take refuge in the arms of mercy drives it to be a great song. The sound is a lot like \"Stained Glass Masquerade\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her\", evoking a subtlety toward the shameful side, feeling as if other Christians are so far above you, and you feel as though you will fall. This song is fantastic at capturing a feeling and then giving an answer as to how to overcome that feeling. The melody combines with the words in a way that only Casting Crowns can do it that makes you feel engulfed by God's mercy. It is amazing.\n\n5. The Word is Alive - 8/10\nAnother message to the discipleship community, this song reminds us that the Word of God is forever, though the world and its glories will fade. The attached verses remind us that the Word is a gift, and that it reveals the truths and eternities of the world to us. Good message, and I especially liked the great verses on the pamphlet to meditate on. The melody is okay, but it lacks the punch of the first 4 songs.\n\n6. The Altar and the Door - 8/10\nThis song is somewhat confusing to classify. I like the melody a lot. It is different than what we expect from Crowns, with a really bouncy sound to it, contributed by the rhythmic guitar background. The words are kind of confusing, though. It seems like an elaboration on the feeling of unworthiness and desperation for remaining Godly. Especially in the middle, it plays almost like a prayer of desperation. The feeling is common, and anyone who's tried to sacrifice their will to God can probably attest. The lyrics don't have the impact of Slow Fade, which shares a similar message, but it's still a fun song.\n\n7. Somewhere in the Middle - 8.5/10\nThis is third song on the album encouraging us to spiritually renew ourselves so that we don't slip into the grey middle ground between God's light and the world. Much like the previous song, it plays like a prayer and a meditation. This one does have a lesson, though: trade your dreams for God's. You may not be strong enough, but He is. I'm also a big fan of the melody of this song. It's not as bouncy as the last one, but the stretch of \"Fearless warriors in a picket fence....\" will stick in your head. Good stuff. Great to just sit and enjoy listening to.\n\n8. I Know You're There - 9/10\nThis is one of Casting Crowns' best songs of worship. It really captures the heart of worship, and the act of being a living sacrifice to the will of God. It's not exceptional, but the lyrics recapture the power of the back half of Lifesong, which is great for a song that is not one of the songs intended to be a hit single. It makes you want to raise your hands and proclaim that God is with us. Great song!\n\n9. Prayer for a Friend - 7.5/10\nThis song was intended for discipleship, much in the way that \"Here I Go Again\" was on the first album. As a whole, though, this was one of my least favorite songs on the album. I liked the use of acoustic guitar, and it was kind of touching, but it had little sticking power. You'll enjoy listening to it whenever it comes on, but it's obviously not one of CC's better songs.\n\n10. All Because of Jesus - 7.5/10\nThis song is a bit basic for my tastes. Yes, it is a proclamation, yes, it is supposed to be that way, but so many other songs say the exact same thing so much better, which reduces this song's value. That, and the sound is a bit to similar to \"Father, Spirit, Jesus\" from Lifesong if you ask me. And that song is a lot better, which makes this song mostly forgettable. Again, though, I don't skip over it because it's still fun to listen to, but it just doesn't stand out enough to score in the 8's.\n\n11. White Dove - 9/10 (bonus track, located at 7:20 on \"All Beacuse of Jesus\")\nAnd here we have one of the most beautiful songs Casting Crowns has written. This song has zero message, as the words kind of sounds like a foreign language at points, and the words which are determinable are about a white dove flying free, and hope in general, but the melody is so soft, so haunting, so beautiful, it goes straight to the heart. This song is like nothing Casting Crowns has ever done, utilizing violin, acoustic guitars, and a soft duet. But it worked. It is a beautiful piece of music.\n\nAVERAGE SCORE: 8.7 / 10\nALBUM SCORE: 4.5/5", "label": 1}

Especially since she has spent years teaching her followers to emulate her \"be honest to your inmost desires junk.\"\n\nOnce he has betrayed her relationship to him, just as she betrayed her relationship to her husband, her publicly being shown to not be in total control drives her to punish him publicly & once again demonstrate her ability to get the upper hand.\n\nThat a movie was made on this person is questionable.

{"text": "Well, as the title states, this was the beginning of the end of a once great band. Bad Religionput out a few amazing records that epitomized hardcore/punk-ish emo/indie from around 1982 on. But on this one finally did a 180 and changed direction. A change that some of us didn't like. Yet so many see this as some sort of landmark monumental release. Maybe for someone whose standards have been dumbed down and don't care about listening to punk any longer this might be great. That isn't me. They still have their share of hardcore ties to their past on this record in various forms but they still went down the tubes anyway you look at it.\n\nBut anyone who truly loved what they did on their self titled EP all the way through to Back To The Known would vomit in their mouth (as I did) after listening to this horrible sign of their catastrophic decline. This was the followup to Back To... and supposed to be their trek into more mature songwriting but something caused them to abandon who and what they once were.\n\nThis album takes the poppiness leanings of their first 3 records to such a (lack of) ambitious slant that it sounds like any other \"alternative\" pop band at the time played on the radio. Gone is the roughness, cheap production values, uniqueness, and devil may care attitude that made them the Bad Religion. But it was all sadly replaced by a radio friendly, mainstream, glossy, overproduced, sellout piece of garbage caricature of what they used to be. And it would only get worse on every record after this until they closed up shop with each successive album selling less and less. By their last record,  their transformation into Britney Spears pop territory had been complete. On here they were almost half way there.\n\nIf you know music and the Bad Religion like I do, buy self titled EP, How Could Hell Be Any Worse and Back To The Known.

A strange request, but this was Hunt's reaction to hearing the original recording, reflecting much of the enthusiasm seen in the comments.\n\nAs she explained to Alex Chadwick of Hearing Voices back in 2004:\n\nI had these messages saying that Robbie Robertson said to get in touch with me. So we went in studio. He said, `I want you to do whatever you feel like. And, now, these are crickets.' So I thought, oh, my goodness. I'm to accompany crickets, see?\n\nAnd when I heard them, I was so ashamed of myself, I was so humbled, because I had not given them enough respect. Jim Wilson recorded crickets in his back yard, and he brought it into the studio and went ahead and lowered the pitch and lowered the pitch and lowered the pitch. And they sound exactly like a well-trained church choir to me. And not only that, but it sounded to me like they were singing in the eight-tone scale. And so what-they started low, and then there was something like I would call, in musical terms, an interlude; and then another chorus part; and then an interval and another chorus. They kept going higher and higher.\n\nThey were saying cricket words. I kept thinking, `Oh, I almost can understand them. It's a nice, mellow tone. And they never went off pitch until one of the interludes, where they went real crazy and they got back on again to where they were. And I know that people do not know that they're listening to crickets unless they're told that that's what that is...\n\n[...]", "label": 1}

Besides, all rap is is really fast-talking. I don't think it should even be considered music either. First Eminem, then Nelly, and now 50 Cent? I think music history has gone way down-the-mountain these days, but I think it's mostly 50 Cents' fault.\nWhy do you think I really dislike him and his CD? 1) I don't like the fact that his album is called \"Get Rich\" because it sounds like he's-you know-Nelly. I don't like it when rappers talk about money because it seems like they only care about getting rich (i.e.\"Air Force One\"). 2) I don't like his lack of clothing, I know, it has nothing to do with the CD.  Today in this music world it seems like they're only receiving money for their bodies, when all they need to get onstage is raw talent. When you step on the stage to sing, they want you to sing not see how fast you can talk including words you made up that can't be found in the English Dictionary. If you don't buy this CD, they won't make money, and they can't show themselves off. 3) When I hear him on his CD, he's often mumbling, or sounds more like he's half asleep, or like he's too afraid to step up to the microphone or something. 4) His songs all sound the same, many of them referring to guns (I wish I could shoot 50 Cent) and sometimes maybe violence. If you're going to make a CD, don't talk about cars and money and getting rich in every song. I'm kind of surprised his \"In Da Club\" was #1 on the top 40 one week. 5) I don't like his language. \"Wangsta,\" is a word that's very strange and if you were to translate that to a genius that speaks Chinese, he wouldn't understand a word you're saying.\nAs a result, poor lyrics and misunderstood language, lack of clothing, lack of talent, and overplaying on the radio (which I'm amazed by) I'm giving him a 1/5. I kind of wish I could give him a 0. In order to save yourself from this CD, do yourself a favor, turn off the radio, and buy something else new like Evanescence or Lillix, as they have exciting songs and they aren't boring or aren't loud enough, or talk about guns all the time.

{"text": "Let the \"was this review helpful to you?... no\"s roll. Believe it or not, I'm not here to give this album a 5. I'd much rather try balancing that deceiving 4 stars the album currently has. Which will be hard to do with an album tailor made to garner the widespread support of mallcore kids the world over. But try I must! I would realistically give this 2 stars. Soilwork has sold out. In a witty retort to the question \"Why?!?!\" Speed (vocals) only commented, \"Hey soilmates, we're facing the end!!\"  For a band that could do anything and go any direction at this point in their career, they would be hard-pressed to have done worse. If you'd like to hear some Soilwork remotely worth listening to, check out their first and second Steelbath Suicide and Chainheart Machine. Really everything before Figure Number Five is pretty swell. A long-time follower of Soilwork, I started worrying about the way they looped simple catchy riffs and lyrics closer and closer together with each album. The main problem with being catchy is usually sacrificing long-term listenability, depth, and variety. With this album, Soilwork has completed their transition from ambitious light melodic death metal to mainstream nothingness. Speaking of variety, the tracks sound mostly the same too. You may find yourself wondering how track one became track four. No depth is to be found here as the act of stabbing drama apparently doesn't involve much thinking. On a side note, the last time I saw anything being \"one with the flies\" it was brown n' squishy. Could the parallels have been drawn into this album...? But I digress. This album is garnering a lot of attention. And why not? Maybe friendly soil-metal sounds good to you too.\n\nCuriously, I thought that despite their heavy association with associate contemporaries In Flames, who notoriously traded their interesting and original sound for nu-metal pop sing-alongs, the disease would surely not be contagious. Well, if you liked In Flames daringly regressive \"Soundtrack to Your Escape,\" you're gonna love this!", "label": 0}

{"text": "While most reviews here were written well before the pop masters death, I'm giving this a new look in the aftermath of his passing, especially since many people just want to renew themselves with his music in their grief and remembrance. When this came out, it was a very good compilation album. It's still a good one now. Not only does it include pretty much every song he had that topped the charts, it even includes some Jackson Five goodies and hard to find--maybe forgotten-- gems like \"Blame it on the Boogie\" and \"Rock your Body Down to the Ground\"  My friends always tell me I can always find that one song that's not on someones greatest hits, and for me, this one is missing another hidden \"Thriller\" soft, sexy and soulful goldie \"The Lady in my Life\".\n\nDespite that omission I can appreciate this for giving you all of his great songs, many, of his great songs in one place, where you can use this CD to create your own play list and import them onto your computer. 1 star reviewers are griping about \"another\" greatest hits album, or remarking on MJ personally (losers) but with the days of ipods replacing turntables, we can't exactly take our \"Thriller\" \"Bad\" and \"Off the Wall\" albums with us when we go out. Now, if you want to still rock to \"Billie Jean\" or \"Another Part of Me\" you either buy it on itunes, buy a converter to copy your records to CD or get a greatest hits album, which is always cheaper and more convenient.\n\nI still don't think there is any one extremely golden and perfect compilation disc out there with MJ's music, as I have mentioned \"The Lady in my Life\" was something I noticed, I'm sure someone else has a favorite song that's not on here too. But this is still the most complete and the best I have seen to date, and is really worth picking up, especially if you don't have a Jackson Five greatest hits (which I also own). I know we don't want to re-buy music, but if you really love those songs from the 80's and (days of tapes) 90's you sometimes have too.\n\nI think an Essential Michael Jackson on DVD with videos would make a great companion. I have yet to find that out there, especially one that respectfully and sensibly has all of his videos in long form.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Michael-Jackson-History-on-Film-Vol-2/dp/1573300403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;(and volume 1) is probably your best one stop shop. Jackson made the videos, I want to appreciate them. I don't want an edited form of \"Smooth Criminal\" or \"Thriller\" and I'm sure he'd want us to appreciate them too. I shouldn't have to feel like I'm chasing John Dillinger just to find the long version of \"Bad\".\n\nOverall, an excellent group of songs, and the price is not outrageous. I get nostalgic every now and then and dust off my record player to listen to \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing), but now I can listen to it on the train, while taking a walk, or even lying in bed.

{"text": "When you have a star like Michael Jackson who has produced many great songs in the 40+ years he spent performing it seems like it would be hard to narrow his career down to two-discs, but for the most part the \"Essential\" series has done it again bring up a summary of the career of The King of Pop.  We get to greatest hits from his days in the Jackson 5, to The Jacksons, and of course, finally we make our way to his legendary solo-career.  It gives you a sense of the evolution his music underwent over the decades.\n\nIf you're a new fan of the International Star, or as a long time fan would like a nice playlist of his hits, this CD is very well compiled.  My only complaint was the omission of his \"Earth Song\" and some of his other, more recent work would have been a nice addition to make the listener really comprehend the changes in his music.  Aside from that it is almost a perfect summary of Michael Jackson's career.\n\n'The Essential Michael Jackson' on its two CDs certainly showcases the talent of a man who was perhaps the greatest entertainer to ever walk to face of the Earth, with his ability to bring about many emotions in his various songs, from being sweet, to rough, Michael had to ability to change his approach on and off the stage.\n\nNotable songs include:\nI Want You Back\nABC\nDon't Stop Until You Get Enough\nThriller\nBeat It\nBillie Jean\nBad\nYou Are Not Alone\nSmooth Criminal\nBlack or White\nAnd many, many more.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The early eighties was probably the strangest era for Alice, with albums like \"Flush The Fashion\", \"Special Forces\", \"DaDa\" and this album, but I kind of like what he was trying to do during this era. I have to admit, I didn't buy any of these albums when they first came out. I think I was too scared by the pictures of Alice on the front and back covers. If you think Alice looked frightening in the seventies with this monster make-up, you should see him on these records, with short hair and fake eyelashes and lipstick and women's makeup! YIKES!\n\nIf you can get past the photos, like I eventually did, you may be as surprised as I was at how good some of the music is, especially on \"Flush The Fashion\" and this one. The songs on \"Zipper\" are still very short and punk rock like, though the emphasis was more on hard rock this time. The guitars sound great, the drums still sounded like drums...there are even a few catchy guitar riffs from time to time. The emphasis this time, however, is more on singing and/or half singing, half talking than on the music itself. I like Alice's sense of humor on this album as well, especially on the opening track \"Zorro's Ascent\" and on \"Adaptable\" and \"I Like Girls\". Alice sings with a snarl and a sneer on his face...his smooth crooning voice only shows up on \"I Am The Future\" and just briefly, for a second or two, on \"Zorro's Ascent\". I like the music for \"Zorro\" and I love Alice's vocal on it...I wouldn't find him this funny again until \"I Love America\" from DADA. \"Scrooge's Song\" also has some terrific music on it. I particularly like the instrumental section at the end, which is the most exciting thing on the whole album.\n\n \"I Am The Future\" sounds like something Alice might have written with Bob Ezrin. If Ezrin produced this song, he probably would have made the drums louder and added an orchestra during the refrain. Still, this is a great song. I was glad to see it included on the boxed set.\n\nThe second half of the album isn't quite as strong as the first half, though there are still some interesting songs. The first three tracks on the second half are so close together and go by so fast, it all sounds like one song. I like \"Tag, You're It\", on which Alice sounds like a director for a horror flick. This and the last song, whose title almost takes up an entire paragraph, showed that Alice hadn't completely abandoned his twisted monster movie dark side. The last song, while having the most interesting title, is unfortunately the weakest track on the album...at least in my opinion.\n\nNo, the whole album isn't great and he has certainly made better albums than this, but I like what he was trying to do during this era, even though I'm sure his record company was very confused by all of it! I do like this better than most, if not all, of the hair metal albums he did from the mid eighties to early nineties.

{"text": "Stabbing the Drama (Dig) sees Soilwork return to more heavy metal while retaining the melody of their latter releases. This is no Chainheart Machine but it is certainly an improvement over the below average Figure Number Five.\n\nFigure Number Five was a big letdown seeing the band move in a new direction that quite frankly didn't work. This album sees them returning to the style of their earlier work while keeping some of the better moments of Figure Number Five. This is Soilwork's hardest release in a while with heavy churning guitar lines, fast drumming and some catchy guitar riffs and even some decent solos strewn in there. Bjrn \"Speed\" Strid delivers one his strongest performance on the album as well with well delivered screams, growls and especially clean chorus vocals.\n\nThe band retains the familiar formula from FNF, with almost all the songs consisting of the of verse-chorus-verse-solo structure. This makes all the songs sound too similar and really brings down the overall quality of the album. Each song has a very similar tempo, vocal styling and structure. The band also hsa some more mainstream sensibilites on this album. The regular melodic death/thrash sound is still retained here but there are even some nu-metal moments in songs like Distance.\n\nFans of Soilwork will probably be happy with this release, old or new. It sees a band returning to their more interesting original sound while incorporating the few good elements of their more recent albums. There is a lot of headbanging material here with One With the Flies, Blind Eye Halo and others. Some of the stuff is a bit too commercial for a release from the Gotherburg scene and the repitive nature of the song brings down the overall quality of the album. However, there is some decent stuff to be heard here with quality hooks, catchy guitar riffs, good drumming and some pretty decent vocals. Check it out even if you were thrown off by Figure Number Five or are looking for some decent melodic metal. 3 1/2 stars.", "label": 2}

{"text": "After the multiplatinum success of \"Acoustic Soul\", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup \"Voyage To India\". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on \"Voyage\" as this album is severely so-so.\nFirst off the production is weaker than on \"Acoustic\" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.\nTired duds like \"Little Things\" and the predictably titled \"God Is Love\" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for \"deep\" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.\nBland \"folk\"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead \"Voyage\" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. \"Good Man\" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.\nFortunately, \"Voyage\" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. \"The Truth\" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired \"love yourself\" retreads.\n\nLook, \"Voyage To India\" makes India to be more of a \"Black-girl\" version of bland, \"folk\" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being \"bootylicious\" or partying or \"her man\" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on \"Voyage\" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not \"deep\".\nIndia. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'.

AR's affair with barbara's husband nathaniel (entered into openly and with the consent of both spouses and the focal point of the movie) does not even begin until page 259 of the 422 page book but the preceding and succeeding in depth discussion of ayn rand's amazing journey from soviet russia to the USA to success as one of the great writers and philosophers of the 20th century is of only passing interest to the producers of this movie. sex and alleged psycho-pathology are all the producers of this movie are really interested in. i guess that is what they think will sell. the famous slapping scene when AR first confronts NB after finding out that he has been cheating not only on her but on barbara with one of his psychotherapy patients (whom the movie calls \"caroline\" even though her real name was patreecia), is intended to show AR as unreasonably unforgiving and vindictive. however, the producers in their zeal to do so, notably fail to show the viewer the many months of suspicion, deception and lies that preceded the ultimate revelation. during those months, as the book makes clear, AR agonized over vague \"problems\" in the AR/NB relationship and tried for hours on end to discuss the situation with NB to help him deal not only with their relationship but also with his relationship with barbara, which was likewise suffering at that time. yes,the book describes her slapping NB furiously and thereafter acting very vindictively against him, and a rational assessment of her actions might indeed find her to have over-reacted. but the  movie does a disservice to any such rational assessment by completely (and i would say deliberately) ignoring the many months during which AR invested so much of her psyche trying to help someone whom she mistakenly trusted with a \"problem\" about which he was being untruthful and deceptive. nor does the movie bother to emphasize the supreme importance of \"integrity\" to AR or nathan's place in her life as a \"hero\" who embodied (she thought) her values. it simply makes no real effort to examine, one might say,  the righteousness of her indignation. the movie has a line where barbara asks AR to show \"compassion\" to nathan because \"that's what people do.\" this line appears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based. although i suppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda, their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named richard for barbara to become involved with!!!! i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage, one might better spend one's time reading the much more even-handed and respectful barbara branden book itself or, even better, watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled \"ayn rand: a sense of life,\" which received an oscar nomination in the early 80's. actually, one should not bother with any of the above prior to reading rand herself: atlas shrugged, the fountainhead, we the living, anthem, etc etc etc, all of which i strongly recommend. she was a great woman, the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary notwithstanding.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was glad to find a more recent version of Lee Greenwood's song \"God Bless America\" but had a mixture of appreciation and disappointment. For one, the sound is much louder and clearer in the 2006 version, but there are awkward passes and just un-soothing tones in his newest release. At one part \"...living here today...\" the \"today\" part of the song was just carried too long and made it a bit awkward.\nWhereas the 1993 version, Greenwood is on Que and hits the notes perfectly so that there is harmony with his dialogue and the music.\n\nIt seems like the 2006 version (this version) was simply edited by his sound team- the output volume pre-adjusted higher, reduced background noise (clarity), and more of an amphitheater feeling. But at the cost of botched pitches and uneven tones. I doubt Greenwood sang the song again, especially if it sounds like what you hear on the preview. Just listen to the previews of the two versions and you will tell something doesn't sound kosher.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I wanted to rate this higher,I really did. I'm sure there are people out there that will disagree with me and that's fine but this is the way I see it. When I first started listening to this CD I thought it was going to be a fantastic album because the first two songs are superb, however things dropped off fast. The third song was nothing special and the fourth song (an instrumental) was boring. The first two songs were different for this band, kind of operatic like Therion. There were flashes of it throughout the album but in all other songs, to varying degrees, Luca Turilli sounded like (suprise) Rhapsody. Now there is nothing wrong with sounding like Rhapsody especially if you are an integral part of Rhapsody. I just thought it sounded redundant, especially after the brilliant start. I decided to listen to the CD a few more times to see if I would like it better and sure enough the sixth, eigth and ninth songs weren't bad and the eleven minute closing title track was acually pretty good but two great songs, one real good song and three better than average songs do not, in my opinion, make a 5 or even 4 star rating.\n  I'm sorry if my review disappoints you but if you want some great epic power metal music take a look at Hastings 1066 by Thy Majestie, which heads my Monsters of the Epic/Power Metal scene list. I've also written a review on that album. These guys also start out with a Therion-esk introduction but they carry it through the entire album better. I wonder if this is the future wave of power metal? Anyway, these guys don't have to worry about sounding like Rhapsody, although they have been compared with them.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in \"Billie Jean.\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \"Bad,\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \"Dangerous,\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Props to 50.  The album works for what he's trying to accomplish............GETTING RICH.  The radio friendly cuts like \"Wanksta\", \"In Da Club\" and if my ears serve me correct the next single \"21 questions\" are just what an artist needs to collect the dough.  As a club DJ, I think these three singles rock the party but even with production from the Great Doctor and the Great White Hope, it's a prime example that Hip Hop has lost its way.  His flow is a little off and the constant \"gun talk\" gets a little old.  We know he got shot 9 times and we're glad he survived. Compairing 50 to Pac or Big is outrageous.  He's a rapper but the two formentioned were EMCEES!  Big difference.  Real Hip Hop heads (like myself), 30 and older understand what I'm talking about.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Why there had to be another Michael Jackson Best of-album with a similar tracklist as \"History\", \"Greatest Hits\", \"Number Ones\" and \"The Ultimate Collection\" remains an open question. But in contrast to the Box Set this album is a lot less expensive. So if you like \"The Jackson 5\", \"The Jacksons\" and Michael as a solo artist this is the ideal collection of songs.\n\nThe first CD starts off peppy with \"I want you back\", \"ABC\" and \"The love you save\" which are without a doubt the three best songs of the \"Jackson 5\" and will surely put you in a good mood.\n\n\"Got to be there\" and \"Ben\" are two timeless ballads which show young Michael's enormous volume. After that the album is taken to another level by a row of sensational dancefloor tracks like \"Shake Your Body\" and Michael's first ultimate worldwide hit \"Don't stop 'til you get enough\", which will truly get every party going. Nevertheless the album even manages to beat this with the never-to-be-beaten baseline of \"Billie Jean\" and the immensely powerful \"Beat It\".\n\nThe second CD presents eight hits from \"Bad\" including the fantastic No. 1 \"Man in the Mirror\" which could not be found on \"Number Ones\" and the catchy \"Smooth Criminal\".\n\nThis is followed by Michael's biggest hit of the 90s \"Black or White\" and further great songs from the \"Dangerous\"-album. Among them classics like the tremendously groovy \"Who is it\" and the bombast-ballade \"Will you be there\".\n\nTo sum it up, on this album every great song is followed by another smash and it thereby shows an immense variety of music. The two CDs undenieably demonstrate that most of Jackson's songs are surely timeless. Therefore \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is the ultimate album for everyone who likes good music. There is no better.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I spent hard earned money on this cd and was kind of dissappointed. It's a pain to give a mediocre rating to a great bluesman. I gave it 3 stars for its music. As a blues record it is not all that much in truth. A good collection of music though. This is the second time that I feel a talented keyboard player has Hurt the bluespower of a record with some interesting ideas that might've worked but just didn't. The first was in the album Harp attack. Lucky petersen on that record plays like leon russel on this one- often without taste but with some good points. Probably both made otis spann turn over in his grave here or there.\nThey at points have all the feeling and tasteful notes of a self-playing piano. The song Lowdown in Lodi is a good one but nothing special. Reconsider baby is the crowning achievment of the record. It was great and Freddy was all a true bluesman could be. Then Big legged woman came on. Fun and a nice aside. Then came another one that just wasn't anything special. Followed by 2 or 3 okay songs but not very deep blues sounding. Then an interesting and good interpretation of The great Howlin' Wolf's How many more years. Ain't no sunshine was not a blues song really but one of the respectable tracks having a real feeling and not being disturbed by the session guys but rather well accompanied. This album gets funky too... of course it's not a real credit to funk in some ways like an Albert King song might be.  I don't want to be too hard on the change but The sky is crying may be to different for some people's taste as it has a different kind of beat and may take some getting used to [ I hated it when I first heard it, but I was just expecting something different and was thrown off ]. Freddy is alright, but whoever [ probably Leon or Denny Cordell ] had the idea to set a slow blues masterpiece to this funky beat and rythm really turned me around for a while there. I have no problem with changing the music of a great song - that's part of the art. But being one of my favorites I was turned off by the change- I guess it's not all that bad though now that I am familiar with where they were going with that. It is still not as powerful that way though I don't think.\nFreddy was one of the greats but this is not one of his greatest, or even close. Reconsider baby is the only traditional slow blues blues track [In my opinion]. I didn't dislike the music in general but I thought I was buying a blues album... ... I do not recommend this to anybody who didn't like Harp attack or understands what I mean about the self-playing piano or is just out for a straight up blues album. I did purchase Albert King's Years gone by with the sky is crying on it recently, and that I do recommend being funky but blues at the same time, great groove.

Here is a rundown of what I love about each song (because I know that I like when others do that for me on other CD reviews)\n\n1. You are Here 5/5 - mid tempo ballad.  very pretty string arangement.  The chorus continues to build to a beautiful creshendo toward the end. A truly wonderful reminder of God phenominal Greatness and that He is mine and He is with me!\n\n2. Miracle 4/5 - the first single released in Australia from this album.  Upbeat and produced by one of the members of the Parachute Band (a worship team from NZ) really catchy.\n\n3. Captured 5/5 - ballad.  GORGEOUS. The lyrics are sheer poetry. \"I need you more than the morning needs the light\"  This is my heartbeat for God and she captures that need for God for all of us!\n\n4. Call upon His Name 6/5 - Yes!  It is that GREAT.  This is my favourite song on the album.  Ballady Hymn.  I see praise dancers and orchestras and the Throne Room!!!\n\n5.  You KNow my Name 4/5 - up tempo.  What a wonderful thing to sing about.  Our phenominal God and the fact that this Creator of the Universe knows my name.  ALso talks about her longing to know Him and be with Him in His phenominal presence\n\n6.  Never Give Up 3.5/5 - Really nice.  Up beat.  Creative.  Just not my style.  Musically and sentimentally really awesome.\n\n7.  Change Your World 5/5 - First single in US.  Music Video on her website.  Gorgeous melody and lyics.  \"I'll forever hear you say, I am your child, Please will you love me, Wont you stay...I live to change your world!\"  Wow...powerful!  Check out her website hoperwanda.com\n\n8. Where would I be 5/5 - ballad.  Where would we be without His love? Too true!  really beautiful melody again!\n\n9.  Glorify Your Name 4/5 - beautiful worship song that was also recorded on Hillsongs Live album \"For All Youve Done\".\n\n10.  Sing over me 4.5/5 - I really love this one.  The thought of God singing over me the way that I sing to Him, but BETTER!  Mid tempo.\n\n11. You are Holy 5/5 - \"...at times I hold my breath and tremble and behold your majesty...in the morning I will seek you...in the evening I will love you...\" AMEN!!!\n\n12. Agnus Dei 5/5 - LOVE THIS ARRANGEMENT!  You need to do something with this song (in my humble opinion) if recording it because it so well loved and so popular already.  Great ending for the album\n\nBasically, she is awesome and anointed and a true God-lover.  It comes across every note that she sings.  If you buy this album, you will be truly blessed.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The Bear's Choice Expanded Edition focuses on the Grateful Dead live in concert. Four additional tracks are added to the original seven and the late Ron McKernan(Pig Pen) sings on six of them.\nThe opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.\nAnyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.\nAgain like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end. My only advise is know how much endless instrumental noodling that you can take.", "label": 2}

Their songs are short, catchy and energetic, filled with lyrics about growing up, being immature, and not giving a [censor] about responsibility.  The band seems to practice what they preach, trashing hotel rooms and displaying other teenager-ish antics.\nWhile their music certainly isn't the most original, what they do, they do well.  Their songs are fast and tight, with plenty of catchy hooks and melodies.  The last song, Pain for Pleasure, is a parody of an 80's metal song, in which the singer's voice goes from a deep pitch to a high squeal; I like the guitar intro too.  The first single, Fat Lip, is really the only song that has a rap type of influence on it, and it sounds a little bit like the Beastie Boys mixed with a tiny bit of punk.  I wouldn't, however, call them punk, which is less produced and more raw sounding.  What does it really matter though how you classify them though?

{"text": "First off, I would like to say that people giving this album review 3 or more stars don't really know a thing or two about rap. This is the most overrated rapper and album of all time. I heard this album bumped out Snoop Dogg's \"Doggystyle\" as the fastest selling debut album with 800,000 copies sold in a week and about 6 million (if I'm not mistaken) copies sold worldwide. Wow. Is this for real? The answer is HELL NO. This is nowhere near Snoop's \"Doggystyle\". I don't know why there's so much hype about this idiot. In my opinion, the reasons why this album sold that much is because he was backed up by the legendary Dr. Dre and Eminem. I don't know what happened to Dr. Dre, why he gave this fool a chance. Another reason is that people hear critics about him and this album and they are curious to find out what this fuss is all about, that's why they buy this garbage. I am one of those, the only reason I give this album a try is out of curiosity.  Now that people know what 50 cent is all about, they won't anymore be buying whatever garbage he is throwing on his next albums. I'm willing to bet that 50's next album wouldn't sell half as much as this garbage sold. If he is lucky, maybe his next album will reach platinum because of the idiots who patronizes this kind of trash. 50 cent has to be the most overrated rapper there is along with Gay-z (thank God he's retiring - please don't come back), Ja Rule (Pac wannabee), Nelly (King of Hip-Pop), Chingy (stupid newbie), Ludacris. And what about that stupid beef with Ja Rule. 50 Cent and Ja Rule has got to be  \"2 of amerikaz most overrated and hated rappers\". There are so many people who hated Ja Rule (50 cent, DMX, Busta, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Kurupt, Daz and many more). The same can be said about 50 cent ( Ja, Gay-z, Scarface, Beanie Seagel, Lil' Kim and many more). I think they only hype up their stupid beef to boost up their album sales. As what you know, people really like somebody dissin' someone like what happened in the Tupac-Biggie era where the West Coast - East Coast beef was still hotter than Anna Kournikova. That really boost up their album sales, and you can thank Suge Knight for that. I think 50 and Ja wants to re-ignite the heat of the East-West feud to boost up their album sales. But the problem is, they ain't Tupac and Biggie, HELL THEY\"RE NOBODY. They both suck. They should do the music industry a big favor and follow the footstep of Gay-z that is to hang up their mics immediately. Their music sucks. Speaking of the album, the only one that you can look forward to are the beats because it is mostly handled by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The beats are good but 50 cent is whack. People should wake up and stop buying this kind of crap `rap'. In that way, people like 50 would be out of the rap map for good. There are so many underrated but deserving rappers (Kurupt, Daz, Mobb Deep, Scarface, E-40, to name a few) out there that deserves more attention and appreciation than these fake ass thugs. Let us support these real rappers instead of guys like 50 cent. I got this message for 50 cent. We will never love you like we love Pac because 1. you're music is crap  2. you are a fake ass thug and  3. you are sooo ugly.\n[!] PEACE [!]", "label": 0}

{"text": "If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since \"Hypocrisy\". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own \"Bells and Whistles\" to stand out from the rest. So on to \"Stabbing the Drama\" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of \"Stabbing the Drama\" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.", "label": 2}

Go buy \"Live At the Wetlands.\" \"Live\" is everything that makes RRFB great; energetic, evangelic, and electric all combined in a volcanic delivery that will re-write your concepts of music.\n\"Unclassified\" is the bland studio brother to the robust \"Live\" album. I am curious to know if the producers ever heard RRFB live before they hammered them into their generic Warner Brothers album concept? From listening to this album, I don't think they had heard RRFB live. The vocals on this album are only slightly short of hideous; nearly all are electronically altered in some way. Having traveled many miles to hear RRFB here in Texas and to the Bonnaroo Festival, I've listened to them enough to say that the vocals here are artificial as is the song format. This is not RRFB at their finest.\nWhen you hear them live or hear \"Live At the Wetlands,\" you hear Robert Randolph sing...sing with the pedal steel. You hear joy, energy, love, and faith in the free-wheeling, un-radio friendly song formats, you hear and experience all the things that make RRFB so wonderful. You don't hear those things on \"Unclassified,\" with the exception of the pedal steel. Even though it is mystifyingly subdued on this album, you can still hear the essence of what makes RRFB great; unforunately, it is constrained.\nI wanted to rate this at one star but could not bring myself to slander RRFB with that stigma. Three stars for all they have done and all they will do; one star for what they have done on \"Unclassified.\"", "label": 2}

{"text": "Well, yes. And I don't apologize. Don't get me wrong, I love Patsy Cline as much as anyone among the many 4- and 5-star reviewers so far, and I really regret breaking the string of assessments. But the fact is, there are many, many more superior compilations available now than this MCA release from 1988 which re-issues an earlier vinyl LP produced by Owen Bradley.\n\nFor a few dollars more you can pick up one which has all 19 of her Country hit singles registered between 1957 and 1982, the last ten posthumously following her death in that March 1963 plane crash.\n\nAlso, like far too many of the early compilations, they chose NOT to give us the original version of her first hit for Decca in 1957, Walkin' After Midnight. That version went for 2:30 and reached # 2 Country/# 12 Billboard Pop Top 100 in May. What they give you here was a re-recording done in August 1961, shorter by almost 30 seconds and performed at a slightly faster tempo.\n\nThe rest are all originals although, technically, tracks 7, 10, and 11 were not among her \"12 greatest hits\" which is, after all, the title of this album. Back In Baby's Arms was the uncharted B-side of Sweet Dreams (Of You), Why Can't He Be You? was the uncharted flip of Heartaches which, not included here, made it to # 73 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in 1962 (but failed to make the Country charts - go figure), and You're Stronger Than Me was the uncharted flip of So Wrong in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Heartaches, legitimate hits left off this volume were the B-side to Walkin' After Midnight - A Poor Man's Roses, Or A Rich Man's Gold [# 14 Country] - the double-sided 1962 hit When I Get Thru (You'll Love Me Too)/Imagine That which reached # 10 Country/# 53 Hot 100 and # 21 Country/# 90 Hot 100 respectively, When You Need A Laugh [# 47 Country in 1964], and He Called Me Baby [# 23 Country in December 1964 and her first immediate posthumous hit].\n\nIn 1969 her rendition of the old Eddy Arnold hit, Anytime, reached # 73 Country, followed nine years later by Life's Railway To Heaven which topped out at # 98. Two years after that, in 1980, a release of her cut of the old standard Always went all the way to # 18, followed in December by a re-mix of I Fall To Pieces [# 61]. In late 1981 her duet with Jim Reeves on Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue?] soared all the way to # 5, and in 1982 yet another version of I Fall To Pieces, this time dubbing her voice with that of Jim Reeves, was a # 54.\n\nWith the insert you do get two pages of background notes written by Jay Orr and Don Roy, a chronology of Patsy's all-too-brief life, and a list of session personnel involved on each of the 12 tracks. But while these features and the AAD sound reproduction makes this a nice, inexpensive, sampling of Patsy, MCA can easily turn it into a 5-star offering by simply following the lead of others who re-released earlier 10- and 12-track CDs [Elvis, Donovan, Sarah Vaughan as examples] with bonus tracks.", "label": 2}

I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me.. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.\n\nInstead listen to REAL female country artists like Shania Twain, Taylor Swift, Carie Underwood, Dixie Chicks, Gretchen Wilson, Reba McEntire and Sugarland.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the \"Oasis After Dark\". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those \"Sounds of The Earth\" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 \"Brotha Man\" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 \"Say\", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. \"Is it like Floetry\"? No. They are more hip than this CD. \"Is It like SADE\"? No. She invokes more soul in her music. \"Al Jarreau?\" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6.

{"text": "I love Lucinda Williams as a songwriter.  I love the title track \"West\".  However this CD sounds like she wrote words and added very basic (and unimaginative) chord progressions, and minimal melodies just to get the words out no matter how clumsey the syllables sometimes sound.  The songs also begin to have a \"same-y\" quality because the chords and tempos of most of the songs are too similar (sort of slow; slow; very slow). OK -- these are songs where the emphasis is on words and mood but, unlike Springsteens' \"Ghost of Tom Joad\" album (minimal melodies with provacative images and stories), Lucinda's lyrical imagery is sometimes lazy or she phoned it in (e.g.\"Wash away the stain. Annoint my forehead with your sweet kiss\" --ooh biblical metaphors, which can sometimes work -she does it on \"Get Right With God\" from Essence) --but on the this CD  they sound like an amature in a songwriting workshop.\nI would enjoy this recording more if the tempos were more varied, if  effort were put into the melodies and if she dug deeper to come up with fresh lyrical imagery.  I will continue to buy her recordings because I believe, even if I'm not ga-ga over this album, she will always grow as an artist.  She's got the talent and the balls.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'd like to start by saying that there is no room for creativity in the mainstream music world these days. Performers like 50-Cent are popular because they are easy to jerk around; they have no real skill, and since they can't think for themselves, they let others do things so they don't have to. The palp MTV and FUSE pass of as \"Rap\" is embarrassing just as much as their hosts for the programs with their constant abuse of the word \"Yo\". 50-Cent is one of those said performers who front like they're real, but are just a media and record executive puppet. I can't even call rappers like 50-Cent an artist or musician, because 50-Cent contributes absolutely nothing in the way of talent to anything he does. He didn't play the music loops (they were lifted), he didn't do the backbeats because he doesn't know how, and he has no vocal talent. Rap NEVER used to be about all the hate and greed found on albums these days likes of performers like 50-Cent. Back in the early 80's, most rappers sung about social upheaval and how bad life could be, and they did it in a way that anyone, from any social and ethnic background could relate to. Rap was for all audiences back then, but now it's just relegated to a black-only audience, which is goes against everything the first wave of rap taught. Rap used to be a form of free-flow creative expression for everybody; women, men, whites, blacks, jews, gays, you name it. But MTV and FUSE have now made it popular opinion that you have to be black, involved with drugs, well-muscled to have a rap career. And no, just because Eminem is now accepted into the rap community doesn't mean he represents any wider of an audience than 50-Cent does, because all of them are bigoted, arrogant little pricks that need to be taught a lesson in treating their fellow human beings like they are human beings. And what the hell happened to the small number of female rappers?! There used to be a few in the early-90's, but they've totally dropped off the radar. The male-dominated rap world needs to move aside, because somebody with talent needs to infiltrate the rap scene and put those guys to rest. If you want an example of some of the best dance/funk/rap albums, I suggest you start with Technotronic (\"Pump Up the Jams\" and \"Trip on This\"). Their songs are amazingly catchy and energetic, and can get a party started even when you don't plan on having one. The music is just so pulsating and alive. It's awesome. It's definitely a fresh alternative.", "label": 0}

That's when other trance or electronica like \"Rhthym is a dancer\" and \"This is the rhythm of the night\"  and way later the group The Real McCoy with \"Runaway.\"  I guess trance really started hitting the radio in the late 90's with songs like \"As the Rush comes,\" \"Will I\" and way later 4 Strings \"Turn it around.\"", "label": 2}

They probably deserve 3.5 stars but in the context of all the music that is out there, all the competition for the best of the best, they stop short of the mark. They are a decent band.

He does do Sinatra's \"All or Nothing at All\" justice, giving it a slightly danceable rhythm and upping the tempo beyond \"crawl\" for a change. This is unimaginative, monotonous background music (I could've sworn that \"Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\" had the exact same melody as \"It's Easy to Remember\") to be avoided even by Coltrane junkies like me.

I'll rate the songs:\n\"What up Gangsta\"- Okay, nice beat but it's just too boring! 3/5\n\"Patiently Waiting\"- Eminem is okay, but 50 Cent just can't get my attention on this track. 3/5\n\"Many Men\"- Tight chorus that really saves a boring song. 4/5\n\"In Da Club\"- just way too overplayed, or it would be nice. 3/5\n\"High All The Time\"-Nope, nice beat but otherwise it sucks. 1/5\n\"If I Can't\"- Nice beat, but he's not being very truthful is he? 1/5\n\"Blood Hound\"- Nice beat but boring. 1/5\n\"Back Down\"- See above. 1/5\n\"P.I.M.P.\"- very boring. He just can't flow. 1/5\n\"Like My Style\"- I definately hate his style. 1/5\n\"Poor Lil Rich\"- nope, no way. 1/5\n\"21 Questions\"- Finally! A tight song by 50 Cent! Go Nate Dogg! 5/5\n\"Don't Push Me\"- No flow, if there is one it would make it worse 1/5\n\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\"- better than others, but not the best. 3/5\n\"Wanksta\"- boring, boring, boring... 2/5\n\"U Not Like Me\"- I ain't seen nobody that sucks as much as him, so yeah, nobody's like him. 1/5\n\"Life's On The Line\"- Okay i guess, but not the best. 2/5\nOverall, if you like an album with beats, this is for you.

{"text": "We live in a time where music definately lacks any originality, every screetchy voiced singing band out there sounding just like the last one you've heard. Killswitch Engage,Dark Tranquility,In Flames, Soilwork etc etc. all possess this type of vocals in there bands. I first heard The Chainheart Machine back in 2000 and it blew me away, very \"At The Gates\" sounding. Then in 2001 came Predators Portrait' which was really good also,it ventured out into a more melodic realm,with clean vocal chorus's which i loved. The albums that followed were nothing less than slow and boring to me, with few memorable tracks. In my mind Soilwork was the first to incorporate this type of clean vocal's into the Death Metal Genre,then In Flames, Killswitch, and so and and so forth. The only problem with this is that Soilwork have taken it to far and crossed over into the Nu-Metal Generation, which isn't to say this album is horrid, its not,it just lacks the complex riffing seen on Chainheart, and the \"every chorus is great\" of \"Predators Portrait\"which combined the complex riffing of the first 2 albums withtout sounding Nu-metalish. The only 2 tracks i give 100% total thumbs up to, are Stabbing the Drama, and Blind Eye Halo(which takes a poke at old Deathmetal)much like on there first effort Steelbath Suicide.

Not to sign them on the strength of this recording. Just enough to give them another audition.\n\nNobody knew what they were going to become, least of all the Beatles themselves. The recording is mediocre, the drumming stale. Yep, sure is. You were expecting Sgt. Pepper? Get a grip.\n\nThe sound of these, which probably came from an acetate, is quite good, all things considered.  First, they were all recorded and mixed in one day.  Second, that day was January 1, 1962, and the boys had partied the night before after a long drive from Liverpool and were feeling a might worse for the wear.  Third, their drummer was average at Best - pun intended.  Still, there is some energy to some of the songs, although many sound absolutely flat.  Listening to the earliest Lennon-McCartney songs are a blast, and you can see their growth from here (1/1/62) to their June 6 session at Abbey Road with George Martin, both playing and writing.\n\nThis CD is an artifact and a pleasure to add to my collection.

It's bad enough that there's bands like Weezer and Blink 182 making a mockery of what punk used to be, but now there's yet another one that not only does the same thing, but also mutilates Iron Maiden riffs in the process.  Yes, much like Papa Roach, Sum 41 thought it would be a good idea to mix Iron Maiden with the \"radio rock\" sound.  But, to me (and to most Maiden fans, I'm sure) it's nothing but a slap in the face.  The song \"Pain for Pleasure\" is pretty pathetic, really.  I mean yes, it is a pleasant surprise after the whiny vocals and inane lyrics that you have to endure to get to this song, but it's only like a minute long, there's no solo, and even Iron Maiden and Judas Priest at their worst moments is far superior.  I do, however, hope that that song opens doors for some Blink fans, and gets them looking into the world of oldschool metal, but ya never know.  Just the same, though, the \"ouch, that song gives me a headache!\" comments do make me smile.  To sum up Sum 41, this is just not punk.

{"text": "Having studied Rand's philosophy prior to watching this movie, I was put off by her uncompromising, unemotional, atheistic ideas. By watching this movie, I was happy to learn that not even the creator of this pseudo-philosophy could abide by its rules.\nAyn Rand is introduced as a cold and calculating philosopher, berating people who do not follow her ideals entirely. But she turns out to be as human as anyone. No John Galt, no superman (superwoman?), her very actions revealed the emptiness of Objectivism.\nRand is the best-portrayed character, although the movie would have benefited from more of her background - the only hint of her past is a brief conversation at a wedding reception. There was a lot more to Ayn Rand than her philosophy and her libido, and the movie failed to show this. Breathing onto a NYC store window, she draws a dollar sign and proclaims it her emblem. Why is this? What personal experiences led Rand to develop this view? The movie leaves these important questions unanswered.\nThe other characters seem one-dimensional, especially the angst-ridden, emotionally fragile narrator. The production of this movie, while okay for a made-for-cable show, leaves much to be desired.\nPerhaps the most revealing scene is when Rand is asked, during a lecture, what \"love\" means to an Objectivist. She cannot truly answer this question. This fits with so-called disciples of Rand I've encountered: empty souls, a lack of compassion and confusion.\nRand's so-called philosophy still has a cult following, and this movie may anger them. To those who reject this film's message, I suggest the following adage: \"Never let a few facts get in the way of the truth.\"", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've been a Type O Negative fan since 1995, always greatly anticipating new material from this unique group.  After my first listen to \"Dead Again,\" I just thought I needed to give it time.  Type O consistently puts out 75-80 minutes of new music and it can't necessarily be digested in one listen.  However, I should have trusted my instincts.  As another reviewer stated, one of the great things about Type is that their complicated music knocks you out the first time!  With \"Dead Again,\" there's just nothing that memorable on the disc.  \"These Three Things\" has some good spots, as does \"September Sun,\" the title track and \"Profits of Doom,\" but nothing that stays with you.  I've been listening to this disc somewhat consistently since it was released and it's good, but that up to par with other Type O discs.  My favorite is October Rust, followed by Bloody Kisses and Life is Killing Me, which I thought was quite underrated.  If you're a big fan, hey, this is still better than 90% of the bands out there, but it's not the Type O we've all been listening to for all these years.", "label": 2}

{"text": "(actually 2 1/2 stars) This album is just what you would expect, I suppose, from the author of Martha My Dear and Why Don't We Do It In The Road...McCartney has always been about having a good time, best foot  forward and all that, and I'm sure that the idea at the time was to record  an upbeat, homey-sounding little record with off-the-cuff spontaneity.  Well, sink me if that isn't what he did! I think one problem with Wild  Life, though, is that Paul was still a bit down in the dumps about his  still-recent divorce from the other three lads, and with Lennon taking  potshots at him in the press along with the lackluster reception for  Ram...well, even the normally bubbly Macca's self confidence must have been  running a bit low. The uncertainty is a bit palpable all over Wild Life;  Mumbo, for example, might have been a scorching rocker if Paulie had been  bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes; Dear Friend is a  conflicted counter-attack on Mr. Ono Lennon without a whole lot of  conviction; Paul comes across as hesitant to really let loose on his  erstwhile bandmate. Bip Bop...well, let's just say it lives up to it's  title...I must admit at odd times, usually when in my cups, I'll go around  humming its absurdly catchy tune. Lyrics? well,they're better than the ones  for Mumbo...I'll let it go at that. OK, I'm being a bit snide, I  know...there is some good stuff here; I really like Tomorrow, with those  nice, echoey BV's from the McCartneys that used to be a highlight (to me,  anyway) of Paul's pre-Venus And Mars output; the cover of Love Is Strange  is...well, lovely but strange. Some People Never Know has a pretty melody,  but Linda was just a little too much up front in the mix...again, some  second takes might have helped here. Really, to me, only the painfully flat  I Am Your Singer is unlistenable. Do I recommend you spend your hard earned  cash on Wings Wild Life? Well, be forewarned that only the staunchest  Beatlefans (of which yours truly counts himself amongst same) will really  enjoy it. This was definitely one of Mr. Mc's valleys,and the curious buyer  should take this into consideration. It becomes a better bargain, though,  if this import version has the same bonus tracks as the US release several  years ago (the nice folks at Amazon.com didn't provide a track listing for  this release)...I've always had a soft spot for his covert f-you to his  critics Mary Had A Little Lamb, and its B-side Little Woman Love is a  rollicking number that would have improved Wild Life considerably.

{"text": "This is the first CD to cover Michael Jackson's entire career from his early Jackson 5 years in the 70s to his later years in the mid 90s. Almost all his number one hits are here and famous songs such as ABC, Bad, Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean, and this CD offers a really great variety of songs. Although there were a few songs that I didn't care for on this CD, as well as songs that I wish they would have included like Earth Song or Never Say Goodbye, it overall has quality soundtracks and is remastered in high sound quality. A minor thing is that they cut some of the songs short from the originals, most likely do to the time limit on the CDs, but the meat and potatoes of all the songs are on this CD and aren't missing much of the original. If you are a die hard Jackson fan, you may want to buy each of his individual albulms, as this CD is missing a few essential songs from certain albulms, as well as cuts a few good songs shorter than the original counterpart, but if you are just a casual Jackson or pop fan, and are looking for a CD with almost all his top hits from the Jackson 5 years to the 90s, this CD is a must buy, and is really the only CD that spans his entire career. It is a lot cheaper than buying each albulm and is worth lossing a few songs over if you don't have the money to buy individual albulms or don't want to go through the trouble of figuring out which CDs to buy to get all his top songs. I think next Sony needs to release a DVD and Blu-ray of all Jackson's music videos, that would be the ultimate tribute to the late King of Pop.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought \"Cool...this just might work!\" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's \"I'm Not In Love.\" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the \"Big boys don't cry\" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the \"I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back\" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with \"Under The Milky Way\", \"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Broken Wings.\" Oh, sure, \"Under....\" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on \"....Town\" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for \"Town\", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for \"Wing\"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal \"Human.\" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. \"Holding On To Yesterday\" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. \"Baker Street\" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. \"Let's Go Out Tonight\" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on \"For The One.\" Much like \"Human\", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to \"Miss You Nights\" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! \"Blue Rose\" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. \"Cry\" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (\"You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb\"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with \"Imagine\", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).", "label": 0}

Fortunately, Mr. Valliant's book, along with Marry Ann Sures'  _Facets of Ayn Rand_ ([...]) proved that Miss Rand was a far better person than represented by the Branden's books, and it was, in fact, the Brandens who were dishonest and manipulative.

{"text": "The one very noticeable feature of \"XXX\" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was \"Twenty One\" back in 1991. \"XXX\" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge/rap/hip-hop/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.\n\nThat being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on \"XXX\", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe \"XXX\" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.\n\nI also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single \"Feel\". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the \"Hot Single Mix\" version.\n\nIt just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music.

Tracks such as \"Fight Fire With Fire\" and \"Trapped Under Ice\" show Metallica at their blistering best, while other songs such as the ballad \"Fade to Black\" display Metallica's ability to write good slower and more melodic tunes. \"Creeping Death\" , a personal favourite, more or less defines the thrash metal genre while \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" shows that heavy doesn't necessairly mean fast. The final cut \"The Call of Ktulu\" is one of the hightlights of the album.

{"text": "Showtime presented The Passion of Ayn Rand in 1999, a sort of advent to Helen Mirren's rise to her current status as \"intermnational treasure\".  She is indeed fine as the enigmatic Ms Rand. Overly stylish direction by Christopher Menaul hinders the appreciation a bit, heavy-handed and too-often brooding and melancholic. The character who suffers most is that of the fine Julie Delpy, some over-the-top histrionics, and Eric Stoltz never amazes (as we know he can) as the catalyst of Rand's resurgence of inspiration. Peter Fonda seems to have become extremely focused in his later years, coming off an Oscar nom for Ulee's Gold, and he is one of the most interesting characters, played very well. I can't say I enjoyed the film, because it, quite simply, wasn't very interesting. Ayn Rand is both loved and loathed by many, and it takes an actress of Mirren's depth and sincerity to pull it off. She does. Rand's idea of objectivism--in essence, every man for himself--is a rather frightening idea, when you think of the chaos that might develop. I applaud the effort, but didn't really enjoy it, except for some of the acting, and a very fine jazz score.

{"text": "\"Since then, I've never looked back, it's almost like living a dream...\"\n\nAs of this writing, other than the 2 CD collection \"25 Years,\" this is the only other place to officially find the song \"I Love You\" on a Climax Blues Band release. I believe it may be on one or two miscellaneous soundtracks.\n\n\"I Love You\" is arguably the highlight of the album. You either love the song or hate it, but I'm with the majority who loves this simple, beautiful song penned by Climax Blues Band bassist Derek Holt.\n\nThis isn't a typical Climax Blues Band song, as it strays from their core Blues-based format; however, the Climax Blues Band, whether they were willing to admit it or not, began straying in the mid-70's, incorporating a disco-based sound (\"Couldn't Get it Right,\" a disco hit from 1976 wasn't much in the blues vein). While Derek Holt had been in the band since the beginning (late 60's), the rest of the band viewed this song as a major deviation from their blues style. Gushy lyrics? strings? No way. the rest of the band so resented the song that they NEVER played the song live in its heyday. The first time it was officially played live in America was when Derek played it in a Karaoke bar in Clearwater, Florida in 2005. Amazing.\n\nA bit of history: Derek had written the song for the album, yet none of the band was interested in playing it. During the recording sessions, the producer asked if anyone else had any songs, and Derek came forward with his demo version of \"I Love You.\" the producer listened and said, \"That's a hit!\" Relucatantly, the rest of the band agreed to put on their 1980 album, \"Flying the Flag\". The first single from the album was \"Gotta Have More Love,\" which peaked at #47 on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"I Love You\" managed to make it to #12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nA song that has been a staple at the weddings of thousands resulted in the ultimate break-up of the band. Had petty differences been put aside, the band's career might have been launched into the stratosphere. The talent was certainly there (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/FM-Live/dp/B003QXFTAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FM Live</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gold-Plated/dp/B003QXHKI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gold Plated</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tightly-Knit/dp/B003QXFHV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tightly Knit</a>&nbsp;are a few of their albums I like); however, egos got in the way of further success, band members quit, and the song and band faded back into relative obscurity as the 80s, 90s, and 2000s rolled on.\n\nWhat about the rest of the album? It's not too bad. \"Gotta Have More Love\" and \"So Good After Midnight,\" are really good AOR songs that still sound good today. \"Blackjack And Me Nothing But Starlight\" is just about the only song on the album that's closest to the band's traditional blues sound.\n\nIf you're looking for the Climax Blues Band album with \"I Love You\" on it, here it is. This is also a pretty good album to serve as an introduction to a fairly prolific band with a great body of work to dip into. If you like \"Flying the Flag,\" be sure check out some of their other albums.", "label": 2}

Usually BEST OF, GREATEST HITS or ESSENTIAL albums/box sets are filled with their complete hit catalogue. But there is always a song or two that should be on there and one song that is one there that shouldn't be. Who (or whom)ever arranged this hit fulfilled 3.0 package is just a few songs of perfect. Agree or disagree.\n\nFirst of all, The 3rd disc starts with \"Can't Get Outta The Rain\". Now before I continue, here's Amazon's start of their product description of the Essential Limited series. 'Each Essential Limited Edition 3.0 expanded 3-CD set features the biggest hits and best-loved songs from superstar artists'. \"Can't Get Outta The Rain\" Best-loved? This song is awful. It's mocking disco with silly chants and noises. Quincy Jones should hide under a tree if ever asked about producing this one. They should have omitted that one. Secondly, where's songs like \"You Can Win\" from his Scarecrow role in the motion picture THE WIZ? Where's \"Scream\"? The only song that he's ever done a duet on record with his sister, Janet Jackson. Of even The Jacksons \"State Of Shock\" with Mick Jagger? Surely you don't mean to say that there was not enough room on the 3rd disc for those two tracks while disc 1 has 21 and disc 2 has 17 tracks on them, pushing disc 3 to 10 selections from 7, my goodness, would be-pushing it?\n\nNevertheless, this is an awesome set. Remember, I AM NOT A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN. But aside from my complaint, it gets no better than this. Starting with a few Jackson 5/Motown tracks to Michael's Motown solo hits, to shifting to The Jacksons and Epic to Michael doing it alone and never turning back.

Instead of the comprehensive and exciting treatment given to the band's first four albums via the Blue Oyster Cult Collection, this release consists of nothing more than the disc, a booklet with corrected musician credits, and a tiny image of the LP's back cover on the disc's tray liner. This kind of treatment may have been acceptable when the album was originally released, or maybe even 15 years ago, but in this day an age it merely inspires annoyance at minimum among fans of the band and this album in particular.\nI do appreciate having a legitimate CD copy of Imaginos, but I will definitely be first in line if and when Sony decides to give the album a serious reissue.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Let me get one important thing out of the way. Peter Steele was my hero growing up. I was greatly saddened to hear of his death, and there is no question that the world of heavy metal is worse off for having lost him. However, I will not allow my admiration of Peter Steele color my review of his last album.\n\nI became a huge fan of Type O back in the 90s when October Rust was out. I loved October Rust, and I had heard and enjoyed their earlier work when it was a post-carnivore thrash sound. I remained a huge fan up until \"Life Is Killing Me,\" which I had mixed feelings about. I feel much the same way about this follow-up. This album doesn't have a song to rival \"Black No. 1,\" \"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\" or even \"Unsuccessfully Coping With The Natural Beauty of Infidelity.\" While it is overall a tight record with a few moments of brilliant composition, it is overall flat and somewhat boring.\n\nCompound the rather uninventive composition with Peter's heavy-handed, preachy born again Christian lyrics and you have a record that alienates long time fans and doesn't deliver on the quality we've come to expect from Type O Negative. It makes me very sad that this was the last album from the band, as I'm sure the future would have been much brighter... or, um, darker.\n\nThis album definitely has more of a rock/groove sound, not as heavy as the older work and not as dark; definitely leaning more toward the beatles end of their beatles/sabbath sound.\n\nI would say this album is okay if you are a huge fan of Type O Negative and want to hear their whole catalog, but don't expect another \"Bloody Kisses.\" It's an album where the band was going in a new direction and the growing pains are rather evident. For your Type O fix, I recommend \"World is Coming Down\" and everything that came before it.", "label": 2}
{"text": "What more can be said of this Contemporary Christian group?  They have an excellent sound blending all three voices in a clear, concise way.  This brother, and two sisters have made their mark.  This particular selection is just wonderful, and causes some real issues to be taken thougjhtfully.  What I've always enjoyed about this group is the high quailty of the music itself, and the arrangements are expertly crafted.  The various songs differ-none are repetious, and more importantly,  the message comes accross without being hammered.  I would refer this CD for Christians, certainly, but also for those who  are seekers, and want to become acquainted with some real classic Christian music. This group is one of the most influential Christian bands, that really had an impact on my early Chistian walk.  If your looking for a Christian band that is just fantastic,  I would say this is one of the best.", "label": 1}

The drug usage isn't so bad as the other subject but this album influences stupid sheeps to think that it is the cool thing to just go out and flash guns and or kill people they barely know for very stupid reasons.  I know that if you listen to this music that your attitude will change dramatically; almost like a drug you will noticed symptoms.  These include paranoia: for example your driving around and you look and people and think that everybody is against you so you dog every guy you see. Also you will think very stupid: example someone cuts you off while your driving, you get extremely mad and start yelling at them profanity and next thing you know you are flashing your gun stupidly and telling him stupid things such as \"imma smoke you foooo!\" which isn't proper english, which brings me to the next symtom, talking stupid.  Example \"yo dogg imma go holla at the birdman and get some dat sweet leaf fo show, dog\" which is just stupid..... Not even english.  You will also look at your woman as if you own her.

{"text": "\"You don't *look* like you would listen to this kind of music,\" said one of the members of The Starting Line to a good friend of mine, after she approached them with compliments of their music.  The guys had just finished playing at the college my friend and I attend, and were hitting up the party scene for the night.  Apparently the cool thing to do is judge honest fans like my friend by their appearance.\nLast time I checked, even pop-punk bands like TSL atleast try to lean toward the \"punk\" side of their genre by embracing the meaning of the word.  All these poppy drive thru bands like to look the look and talk the talk, but when it comes to actually representing what punk music is supposed to be all about, they fall way short.  The way I see it, punk music originated partially to defy silly trends and speak out against conformity.  Since when does that kind of independence and anti-mainstream mentality coincide with the \"authority\" to judge people and make rude comments to fans?\nEven after their show, the guys packed up in a hurry and seemed slightly bothered by the college kids who stuck around to grab pictures and autographs.  They would whip out their sharpies and sign the obligatory CD inserts and newly purchased tshirts, but they seemed to have little interest in actually talking or communcating with any of the people who had been at the show.\nThe Starting Line sounded good live and it was a fairly energetic set.  The songs on the CD are infectious and catchy and lead singer Kenny has a good voice.  The lyrics are fairly cheesy and juvenile but that is to be expected.  In other words, the album is decent albeit typical.  It's nothing you haven't heard before, but maybe that's the kind of thing you're into.  It's not \"bad\", but I could never respect a band that seems to have such little respect for the people that support them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Soilwork have been going downhill since Natural Born Chaos. That album was OK, but the songs were very formulaic (screamed verse, clean chorus, screamed verse, clean chorus, solo, chorus, end). Figure Number 5 was an even bigger step backwards, as they not only stayed with basically the same formula, but simplified their songs and brought the synthesizers even further forward into the mix - something basically no melodeath bands have done succesfully.\n\nSo then comes Stabbing the Drama. I was excited to hear that they would be playing faster/heavier than on FNF, but then nervous when they said they were taking out the solos. Both these things seemed t opoint towards them going face forward into a simple Killswitch Engage style sound. This is basically exactly what they do.\n\nThe guitar melodies are basically gone, instead you get boring and repetitive chugging. The melodies are created by synths, not a good idea. Bjorn's vocals are still along the path of screamed verse and clean chorus (omg so interesting! Especially how he does it on every single song!). The guitar solos are gone(except on 2-3 songs), they were basically the one redeaming thing on FNF.\n\nThis album does have some redeaming points though. For it's genre of sloppily played melodic death metal infused with hardcore, they do better than most of the bands. Atreyu, Trivium, Unearth and All that Remains all play this genre and do worse than Soilwork. That being said, Killswitch Engage's Alive or Just Breathing is still a better album than Stabbing the Drama. And everything here is worse than earlier Soilwork like their masterpiece A Predator's Portrait.\n\nAnother redeaming trait is the song \"Blind Eye Halo\", it is heavy, fast and has a guitar solo. True it is no \"Sadistic Lullaby\", but it is still quite heavy. The third and final redeaming thing about STD is their new drummer. Also in the band Scarve (where he plays a LOT better than on STD), Dick Verbeuren is definitely one of the top 10 drummers in metal. He does not display his full chops on STD, but his drumming still makes that part of the album interesting.\n\nDespite these things, I'd still rather listen to A Predator's Portrait instead of this album. Comparing these two to each other it is worse in basically every way except that STD is more accessible to the Metalcore crowd.", "label": 2}

{"text": "[Let it first, be know that this is my girlfriend's account and she should not be held responsible for this review...  I am `Uncle Mat' and and you will be hearing from me in the future.]\n\nI find it ironic that the last song on the last album was called, `The Dream is dead'.  First of all, I was really surprised with a March release, being that Type O (at least for me) had come to represent the fall and Halloween.  I was really excited, nonetheless, so, I wasted no time in getting out all my Halloween decorations in preparation for the big day.  Hearing, `These Three Things', on the website, had me confident and even more excited about my favorite band being back!\n\nOh, the running around I did and the money I spent in celebration of this new album... Do you know just how hard it is to find orange and black stick candles in the spring?  Well, I found them, along with the also needed green ones.  So, there I am at my home studio/ computer work station surrounded by orange black and green crepe paper, about 30 or so lit candles and lanterns, two open bottles of $25 Cabernet Sauvignon (I won't be needing a glass) and the anticipatory and gentle hiss of my studio monitors, telling me that my \"Halloween in Spring\", was about to put any type of `Christmas in July' celebrations to shame.\n\nI placed the CD on the rack and pushed the close button.  Little did I know that that very moment would be the summit of my night.  The first song finished and I told myself, `it's OK, there's still nine to go... then eight... then seven.  The first song I found myself kind of liking was `Summer Sun' but, even then, the opening minute or so, reminded me of Adam Sandler singing, `Somebody Kill Me' to Drew Barrymore in `The Wedding Singer'.  The CD played on.\n\nFinally, there was `These Three Things' but, this time hearing it through, left me with a bit of a sullied felling in my stomach.  Half the CD was over and so far this song was the only semblance of which I had grown to love Type O Negative.\n\n`An Ode to Locksmiths' is a somewhat notable tune but, then again, it sounded like it could have come from any number of other bands.  The album finished.  I wasn't drunk; I was brooding for all the wrong reasons and I started to think that if I wasn't careful, all these candles could really burn the house down.  I took a break then listened to it a second time and still there was nothing.  I waited four years and spent $80 ($95, if I count the CD itself) for THIS!!!  It should have been called, `An Ode to Skater Punks'!\n\nWhere's the `Love you to death'? Where's the `Creepy green light'?  Where's the `Todd's ship Gods'?  The `Red Water's; the `All Hallows eve's. Where's the `Haunted', the `Burn with me'; the `Everything dies'; the `Who will save the sane?'?  I could go on and on.  Where are the rich, haunting, brooding and beautiful melodies?  Where are the anthems of layered chorus' and polyrhythm that were so richly a trademark of Type O's indelible sound?\n\nThis I have to ask of all you die hard Type O fans who are commenting on this album with rave reviews... If you loved Type O so much before this album, what is it you like about it and if you love this album so much what on earth did you like about them before?  I really don't get it and as far as I'm concerned I'm really feeling like `The dream is dead'.  If they want to reclaim what they truly are in the NEXT four years... fine. But, I won't be waiting with bated breath this time.  I'm too old to take up skateboarding.\n\nI wanted Halloween and what I got was April fools day!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Dr. Dre ahs done a lot for hip hop over the eyrs, with his classic albums both solo and in NWA,a dn the success of his proteges Snoop and Eminem. This, however, was a very bad call. This guy's rapping ability is almost non-existant, he just mumbles incoherently.\nThe songs aren't his own work, so I guess it's not his fault they're bland motonous and lyricaly immature, merely working off the new image of 'hip-pop' - where the social change, street-level rebellion and push for self-improvement are replaced by the worst of pimpz, gangstaz and gunz cliches.\nMost of this guy's audience don't realise how cheap and lame it all is. 50 Cent merely gives rap a bad name while being a simple money-makng machine. I almost thing the guy should go back to the dealing, at least he was good at that.", "label": 0}

Sure the Sum farty one guys are pretty funny (well except cone head or whatever the hell is name is) but they can't play music very well. Sure the guitarist will have the occasional solo now and then but it still does not change the fact that the music isn't good, the lyrics are stupid and a lot of their songs from Half Hour of Power sound exactly the same as some of the songs on this! Real creative boys!\n\nNow the fun (or painfull) part:\nDerek (frontman) He isn't good at being a frontman and pokes at his head to much\nLead Guitarist dude (he isn't a very good guitarist dude)\nCone Face: he isn't a good bassist\nStevo: while funny hes not the gretest drummer!\n\nPS: PFFFF", "label": 0}

If you think Shania and Garth are  what country music is all about, you won't get the message at all.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Black's first CD, \"The White Album\" (is it a law that people with the last name of Black or White have to name their album that?) was a comedic stroke of genius, but with each album, he gets worse.  At the best, Rules of Enragement elicited a couple of chuckles from me, but not the gut laughs that \"The White Album\" and half of \"The End of the Universe\" did.  Stick with those two CD's and his Daily Show appearances.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Quiet is the New Loud is very cool in indie circles. However, in the same way as The Strokes and The White Stripes, it is not deserving of the praise lauded on it by the indie-cool crowd. To be honest the problem is that it's a bit boring. Songs like Toxic Girl and The Girl from Back Then are good, they are pretty and they are well-written, but they are not important in any way.\nNothing on this album really lives up to the genius of the cover photograph and, after the first 5 tracks, you really start to wonder why you'd want to bother. Call me stupid but I like music to make me think, or make me feel something. With the exception of the odd bitter-sweet lyrical moment, this doesn't do either.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I am disappointed because it is not a jazz album.  It is a James Blunt kind of pop album produced by David Foster.  Don't get me wrong. I like James Blunt too, but this is not at all a jazz album by Peter Cincotti. Nothing jazz here on any song.  I am not saying the music is bad, just the direction he takes is very unexpected.  it is like Kiss becoming a boyband.  I am sure some people will like it as the music is decent.  Personally I will go back to his first 2 albums. I still like the very first one the most.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This audio recording is actually taken from the Blue Line's performance\n\non the Ohne Filter TV show, Germany. It would be a shame for someone to spend a lot of money on this disc when they can simply listen to the DVD, which is currently available.", "label": 2}
{"text": "The 2-disc set documenting The Concert for New York City contains what appears to be music from a spectacular variety of acts; all live and all carefully chosen by the artists to pay tribute to the fire and police corps who helped save lives in the wake of the 9-11 disaster in New York. In fact, it's a night of mostly classic rock for baby boomers. I'm no youngster myself, but David Bowie opening the show with a horrible version of Simon and Garfunkel's America sets the wrong tone for me. The inexplicably deleted Macy Gray cover of With a Little Help From My Friends was much more interesting when I saw the show on TV. Don't get me wrong - I've got a soft spot for a lot of these acts: James Taylor is always a delight and the response of the crowd upon hearing his soothing voice was sincerely moving, but that drama doesn't come through on CD. Not JT's fault. The good tracks are few - Jagger & Richards' Salt of the Earth was a great choice. Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer is nice even if it was also included on Tribute to Heroes. The 'to hell with everybody' tone of their other two tunes almost negates Prayer's impact, though. While Jay-Z and the Backstreet Boys sound like they were booked for the wrong benefit, Destiny's Child does Emotion better than the Bee Gees ever did, mostly because they're actually young women instead of aging men trying to sound like young women. Five for Fighting also holds its own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit Superman. But John Rzeznick of Goo Goo Dolls had no voice to sing Iris, so it was left of the CD in favor of the band's cover of Tom Petty's American Girl, which doesn't require as much pure voice. Billy Joel was also not in the best vocal form, although his choice of Miami 2017 from his early catalog was eerie and bold. Melissa Etheridge's live performance was a technical nightmare that somehow the studio engineers managed to clean up. But her two songs only prove what I've always thought about her: she rocks hard, but she's predictable and boring. Warning: The Who gets 25 minutes for three songs on this recording. At least they're in fine form, though, especially Roger Daltrey whose voice seems to have had plenty of rest in recent years. Paul McCartney, who planned the evening, gets the last four songs to show how ragged his voice is these days.", "label": 0}
