It addresses such subjects as food selection ,motivation, exercise, avoiding temptation, appreciation and maintaining weight loss. The success of any hypnosis cd is based on the excellence of its script and the skill of its narrator.  This set, unfortunately, misses the mark on both.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid too much specificity, the information is broad and at times sketchy. For instance, it is suggested if at some point, later clarified as after many weeks, one tires of the program they are on, they should switch to another program. Dieters frequently encounter plateaus and switching programs, say from low calorie to classic Atkins, is generally not effective. Moreover, jumping from diet to diet is rarely helpful. Instead of presenting doable lifestyle changes, it is suggested that the listener eat vegetables, learn to love salads and drink plenty of water. I did not find the induction effective and the script lacks a  pleasing flow. But worse than the script is the narration. The voice is loud and the pacing uneven and jarring.

{"text": "Helen Mirren -- as usual -- gives an excellent performance as Ayn Rand, and she's the main reason to see this film.  The rest of the cast is fine; the script -- which should have been called \"The Panic Attacks of Barbara Branden\" or \"The Affairs of Nathaniel Branden\" -- assumes the viewer already knows everything about Ayn Rand's fiction and philosophy.  This is a big problem.  For example, near the beginning the Brandens are shown meeting Ayn Rand and her husband at their home in California.  This brief scene then cuts to the young couple driving away, filled with excitement about the hours they've just spent talking with their idol, Ayn Rand.  Unfortunately the viewer isn't given a clue as to what their all-night conversation was about.\n\nThis film would've been far more interesting if the focus had been more on Rand and her ideas, not mainly on the sex between her and Nathaniel Branden, or on Barbara's fainting spells.  There should have been at least two or three scenes between Rand and the Brandens, or with Rand giving speeches or interviews, that would serve to clarify what her ideas were and why they attracted and influenced so many people in the 1950s and 60s.  (There is one brief exchange of dialogue at an Objectivist lecture where Rand answers a question about her core beliefs by stating: \"Reason.  Individualism.  Capitalism.\", but that's all we get to hear, folks.)  Otherwise the film makes it difficult to understand why Rand became such a magnetic cult-figure and was able to command such devotion from her friends and followers.\n\nOnce again: see it for Mirren's performance, but try to imagine a better script.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Okay, I know I'm supposed to just stick to  reviewing this latest effort from Jewel. I've heard this c.d. twice now, and, though it has some nice moments, I can't help but feel that this is one of the saddest cases of \"sell-out\" that I've ever seen/heard. When Jewel came on the scene, I couldn't believe the beauty and power in her simplicity, and the impact of her \"poetry.\" I still have the video of her on \"Hard Rock Live\", which I consider to be one of the most beautiful performances I've ever seen. No flash, no gobs of make-up and booty...just a naturally gorgeous little girl, her acoustic guitar, and her incredible, raw, natural talent. What a breath of fresh air she was, and I still consider \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" a classic. Though no one expects an artist to keep singing the same song for 20 years without becoming bored & wanting to change and grow, listening to this effort, it's obvious she was given a total make-over by the money brokers -that be. I saw her recently on VH1's \"Divas\", which coincided with the release of this recording, and, I couldn't believe it when I saw her come out, I thought I was seeing Pamela Anderson. At the risk of sounding unkind, she looked ridiculous.  Her discomfort was palpably, painfully evident...I have not seen anyone look that uncomfortable since President Clinton said \"I never had sex with that girl.\" Not only was she out of place, she was all - around bad. Look, life is hard enough when you're an unknown nobody like me, so I can only imagine the pressures that are upon a known artist to \"produce\", stay with the times, etc...It takes a lot of courage I'm sure to stay true to your own vision, and, many do not. I'm not judging them, but I am incredibly sad that this wonderfully talented girl has allowed herself to be transformed into a second- rate Brittney/Shakira. These recordings aren't necessarily bad, they're just, with the exception of one or two, run of the mill formula songs, in my opinion, made for mass consumption. No calories, no taste, & no feeling. I hope this is just a transition and she gets back to just being herself, which was someone whose natural talent and songwriting ability put all the bump & grind Pop Floozies, most of whom have overstayed their 15 minutes, to shame.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Steve Winwood had been experiencing a feeling of frustration with his self-titled debut in 1977--basically, he was disheartened by contractural obligations, feeling that making the album was too much for the record company and not enough for his own enjoyment/ satisfaction.  With \"Arc of a Diver\", originally released on the last day of 1980, Winwood wanted to turn things around--he made the album entirely at his own pace, and he wanted it to be something of a rebirth for him.  He played all the instruments on the album himself, and he also handled all the producing and engineering chores.  The one musical area where Steve did get assistance is songwriting--every track is written by Winwood with a co-writer.  For a majority of the tracks, the co-writer is Will Jennings who would remain Winwood's primary writing collaborator for all of his albums through 1990's \"Refugees of the Heart\".  The opening song here is the big hit \"While You See A Chance\"--it's a perfectly good song with a strong melody, but the sugariness keeps it from being truly transcendant--that said, this song immediately establishes the Winwood/ Jennings \"feel-good formula\" that would yield huge commercial success later on in the decade (i.e. \"Higher Love\", \"Roll With It\", etc.).\n\nOverall, \"Arc of a Diver\" is a frustrating missed opportunity.  It seems Winwood was trying to \"update\" his sound by going really heavy on synthesizers and electronic percussion.  Problem is, on several tracks the synths are used to really lousy effect.  The title track, co-written by Vivian Stanshall, is a strong composition, very catchy and melodically crafty, but the blaring, grating synth takes away from its impact.  There's also dreary synth on the corny, somewhat aimless uptempo tune \"Second-Hand Woman\"--it gives you a \"what the heck is this?\" feeling the second it starts.  And the wavery synth is really headache-inducing on the album-closing ballad \"Dust\"--it seems he was trying to simulate an orchestra/ string section; he'd have been way better off just sticking to a real piano.  He goes easy on the synths--'plays it straight', if you will--on \"Slowdown Sundown\" which features acoustic guitar, piano, organ, and even mandolin, but unfortunately the tune itself is rather dull and sluggish.  \"Night Train\" goes for edginess, but it's hollow and rambles on much too long, although it does totally point the way to the far superior title track from \"Talking Back To the Night\".  Winwood does hit the mark big time though with the wonderfully melodic, intricately-arranged \"Spanish Dancer\", co-written by Jennings--on this track, the combination of synths, dreamy lyrics, & Winwood's smooth, soaring vocals result in a terrific, ethereal track.\n\nYou get a sense of Winwood just \"going for broke\" with this album, hoping that the then-modern production values would catch people's ears; apparently, it worked, since this was reportedly a major critical success, as well as a big hit commercially with the \"While You See A Chance\" single obviously having a key impact on the latter.  Trouble is, with much of the new-ness that got people's attentions at the time having been in poor taste, the album ends up being quite dated, a word I generally hate to use since I feel it gets thrown around a lot and is often misused, but it's fair to use it here.  Still, there is some really good music on \"Arc of a Diver\"--it's easy to wish more of it could be of the same caliber as \"Spanish Dancer\", a great piece of songwriting and a brilliant song that balanced the technology with tastefulness and imagination.", "label": 2}

You'll love\nit, I guarantee!\"\nI think the line, \"the new, cool Jewel\" sums up my point very well. I am unsure of Jewel's intentions with this album, but it is undoubtedly swaying listeners such as the above reviewer her direction. I must have not of received the memo that said we are now judging music on how \"cool\" someone is versus the overall quality of the music.\nI do feel this album is not up to par with her previous releases, but you have to give some credit where credit is due for at least attempting to make a pop album with some thought behind it. Most typical pop albums don't try to criticize the politics of the nation, or offer an analysis of the state of pop culture. For this reason alone I give it 3 stars, it sets a higher intellectual level for pop albums to hopefully try to live up to, but we all know they won't\nJust to offer an analysis of our behavior as reviewers, its funny to me that the reason some won't listen to jewel now is exactly why some people will listen.

Love Songs compilations are always among my main buys, as I'm a mellow guy who really likes sentimental and romantic music, and Chicago's Love Songs contains not only their best romantic hits, but a collection of their most soulful pop and beautiful melodies, famous or not, it does contains some of their biggest hits like \"You're The Inspiration\", \"If You Leave Me Now\", \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry/Get Away\", \"Colour My World\" and \"Hard Habit To Break\", all of the being their most famous love songs, while the rest of the songs are minor hits, and, as Chicago is a pop band, their most beautiful songs are obviously romantic ones, so, in this aspect, the album is really good. But then comes the vast majority of bad aspects from the album, mainly those like Chicago's early fans won't be comforted with this album, as it doesn't contain any of the early rocker style from Chicago, also the fact that a lot of love songs were unnoticed for this compilation, so a better title would be \"greatest love hits\". So, musically there is actually a bad aspect, but apart from it there's also the fact that Rhino got too exagerate with so many Chicago's compilations, so we're destined to hear the same group of songs over and over again. Anyway, if you like Chicago's heartful pop, and you still haven't buyed more than two of their compilations, this stands as a beautiful, joyful and correct release.", "label": 2}

{"text": "(Two and a half stars)  In 1993, Sarah McLachlan released \"Fumbling Toward Ecstacy\", an unqualified success musically, lyrically, and commercially.  The album won an audience of millions with its beautiful arrangements woven around deeply moving lyrics and melodies.  However, in the ten years between the release of \"Fumbling\" and the new album, \"Afterglow\", Sarah released only one album of new studio material (Surfacing).  This suggests a period drier than the Sahara (creatively) for Sarah who also released an acoustic album of previously released material, an album of B-Sides, a live album, two live videos, and a re-mix album in that same ten year time span.  The release of Afterglow confirms the suspicion Sarah may have peaked in 1993 at a very young age.  The material on Afterglow is(barely) saved only by the warmth of her voice.  The music is uninspired and bereft of the originality, passion and spark that made Solace and Fumbling Towards Ecstacy so endearing.  Apart from the opening and closing tracks, Fallen and Dirty Little Secret, Afterglow runs together like forty minutes on your local of Lite-rock music station.  The melodies are forgettable and performance is lacklustre.  It's too bad.  Of all the successful Canadian female music artists (Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Alanis Morrissette, Diana Krall), Sarah McLachlan is easily the most talented and sincere.  I hope that an artist doesn't have to suffer for his/her art, because Sarah certainly deserves the personal fulfillment that she seems to have obtained.  Regretfully, however, history would probably have been better served if Sarah refrained from recording anything new until she had something to say.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I must confess that I have been so tuned-out by what passes for popular music these days that I had no idea that the Bangles had released a new album in 2003. The packaging contains a \"bonus\" DVD, so with that added incentive funds for the CD was added to my slim budget. I like to get one-on-one with the music rather simply engage it as atmosphere, so on went the headphones. Actually having to listen to the songs that way allows one to judge its tunefulness, and a dull song is easily identified.  The titles and lyrics of most of the songs suggested Alanis Morissette territory, but fortunately the playing and singing isn't mean-spirited enough to appeal to the revenge fantasy crowd.\n\n  Those hoping for a complete break from mind-numbing dullsville with a welcome blast from the past, however, will be somewhat disappointed. This is not the Bangles you remembered from the 80's. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to call this a Bangles' record at all--under-produced in a country rock sort of way, muted guitars and vocals on most of the tunes, and rarely exuberant. I guess this is what you call \"growth,\" but a lot of what was great in the past is still great for a reason.\n\n  The first three songs are stuck in the same groove, the kind you skip over to get to the good stuff, relatively speaking. Melody makes a welcome intrusion on the proceedings in \"Ask Me No Questions\" and from there the record is fairly listenable. The most obviously Sixties's influenced number, \"Nickel Romeo,\" is also easily the most interesting song here, a cross-pollination between psychedelia and Dylan (I guess). The beat picks up on \"Ride the Ride\" with its retro organ and chorus adding some musical variety. \"I Will Take Care of You\" sounds like a country ballad, but tough guitars  on \"Single By Choice\" lends the sentiment credibility. But only on \"Mixed Messages\" do the girls let it all hang out, with the playing and singing approximating their glory days. After all is said and done, the only song here that I would add to a compilation on an mp3 player is the finale, \"Grateful\" with its sweet lullaby effect that somehow makes the trip not a completely joyless experience. But, alas, the CD is copy-protected (bad move).\n\n  This is a two-star record I'm giving three, since this is, after all, the Bangles who at their best provided some memorable bits of popcraft in the Eighties; I'd take them over Madonna's self-absorbed posturing any day of the year. I would like to hear more from them, but for now, the title of The Essential Bangles compilation pretty much states all you need to know.", "label": 2}
{"text": "In one of their songs, they sing \"I don't waste my life and become another victim of conformity\"...  Yesss, be the ever teenage rebel who hangs out all day and night, skipping school, get stoned and then drunk.  Yesss, thats the life to live... Or you can always go to school, get a good education and then a well-paying job and be an excellent citizen. Oh but there is a problem, we cannot be teenagers for life.  If you try to live your teenage life past your teenage years, you will face one failure after another and then become miserable and envious of other people's successes.

I don't think her music will ever be as good as \"Pieces of You,\" and that fans either have to stick to her old stuff or accept her new image.

Trying to compare this to Tupac or Biggies work is crazy. Not even close. As far as debuts go Jayz's debut album \"Reasonable Doubt\" blows this out of the water, never mind the Biggie and Pac masterpieces!! Come to think of it the white kid from Detroit who produced and rhymes on a couple of the tracks (\"Patiently Waiting\" being one of the stronger tracks) comes much closer to being cut from the same cloth as a Big and Pac, but doesnt get recognized for it cause of the color of his skin. Just listen to how much tighter his flow is than 50's on the joints they do together. Anyway, thats a whole other debate in itself.

{"text": "I ordered this album as I'm a big fan of the beach boys and was curious as to what hidden treasures Mr Love may have had on offer.\n\nAs usual the service from Amazon was excellent and the package arrived on time.\n\nAs it was a little too wide to fit through the letterbox I had to sign for it.\n\nThe delivery guy didn't look well, his brow was sweaty, his breathing heavy and his movement somewhat laboured.\n\nAfter I signed he stumbled away and seemed to keep repeating the words 'the worst of times.\n\nAnyway, I went back inside, opened the packaging, as a side note when I opened the package a gust of air that smelled very much like sulphur, filled my nostrils and I swear I heard a noise that sounded like 312 people in a casino lounge groaning in pain.\n\nUpon reading the track listing on the sleeve I was very disappointed that Mr Love has only one co writing credit on an album containing 10 songs. I can only assume he was saving his best stuff for the beach boys. Him bring the primary, and extraordinarily talented, lyricist of the group.\n\nAnyways, I put the record on the turntable, put the needle down and heard that wonderful pop and buzz as the record was about to start.\n\nThe opening line of the title track 'looking back with love' set the tone for the whole album, a most gruesome violation of the eardrums.\n\nMikes nasally voice singing lyrics made up of song titles, cultural nods & the obligatory use of the word 'excitations'.\n\nWhile that song should've been enough to put me off listening to the rest of the album I decided to persevere. Turns out I'm something of a madochist.\n\nWith each song, or rather nasally dirge, the listening experience became something of an ordeal and the song 'rocking the man in the boat' I found particularly disturbing given it's subject matter of activities that should not be discussed outside of the bedroom.\n\nThis was made worse by the fact I could picture mike love in one of his signature creepy poses moving ever closer to me, yet still I persevered.\n\nBy the time I reached 'paradise found' the final track on the record, I felt nauseous, slightly disturbed and very angry at myself for wasting almost four English pounds on that drivel.\n\nAs soon as the final song finished I leapt from my seat and stopped the record immediately out of fear that there may be hidden bonus tracks.\n\nIn disgust I took the album out to the yard, placed it on my barbecue and set the 12 inches of evil akight and the strangest thing happened, the flames burned green and an awful noise that sounded like an old man with rhinitis saying 'WHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENN' for about a minute.\n\nI would not recommend this album to anyone.\n\nListening to it was a very uncomfortable experience and made me want to shove hot knitting needles in my ears.\n\nI'm very disappointed that I'm obliged to give this album a minimum score of one star.

Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of \"Down Here On the Ground\" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the \"Weekend In LA\" album.\n\"Breezin\" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than \"Breezin\" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his \"Weekend In LA\" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.\n3.5 stars", "label": 2}

The two other performances are also very good. Borodin's \"In The Steppes Of Central Asia\" is played here with great authority. I wish Gergiev would record Borodin's other orchestral works, especially the symphonies. The other performance is of Balakirev's \"Islamey\" and it, too, receives a passionate performance.\n\nThe only downside for this recording is the audio. In loud passages, the audio sounds compressed. The quieter passages sound pretty good, it's just when the louder passages come it sounds as if it's being squeezed. There also seems to be a good bit reverb. Since this is a live recording, I'm able to overlook the audio. Live recordings are very spontaneous events to record. Sometimes the results aren't always satisfactory.\n\nIf you can get past the audio, this is a smashing performance. Full of passion, fire, and intensity.

However, I will say that either way, you will be blessed more if you are in the Christian faith, or at least have a propensity toward this expression of faith.\n\nAnyway you want to define it (and there are \"a million ways\" to do that), this music will lift your soul to God, boost your spirituality, and strengthen your resolve, determination and tenacity to pursue a higher degree of intimacy with the ALL-LOVING GOD.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Upon purchase, description does not specify that some songs only available with CD purchase.  If this had been made high visible or prevalent, the purchase would not have been made.  This is the case for many of my digital purchases. For the amount of money charged, all songs should be digital and available for immediate play.  Also, some of the digital songs stop, skip and forward to the next selection without completion of the song.  This is an ongoing problem with all of my Amazon digital music purchases.  Amazon needs to address this or refund customers who encounter this continually,", "label": 0}
