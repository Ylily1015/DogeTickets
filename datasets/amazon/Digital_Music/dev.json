{"text": "hello there you great people of the hip-hop community im back to do another review for all you 50cent first time buyers and 50cent fans who for some wierd reason haven't bought the album yet.\n\ni must say that im not a massive 50cent fan and im more on the old classics but i felt like i needed to do i review on 50cent. i do have 2 50cent albums in my collection but i wouldn't say there on the top self (that space is saved for pac, tweedy bird loc, bloods and crips and C.M.W) but i do have 50cent in there.\n\nnow this was the first 50cent album i bought and i will admit it took some growing on me, for you hip-hop fans of the classic older hip-hop might feel the same when listening to the cd, some of 50cents lyrics can seem a little corney but this album does seem like his best so far. most people know about 50cents back ground from the film he realsed about his life so we know the guys not had it easy and a lot of what he rap's about did probably happen to guy (there's nothing worse then an artist lying about what a harsh life he's had growing up in the getto if his mum and dad bought him a brand new bmw for every birthday)\n\ni think 50cent has done well on this album, dre had a lot of influance on the album but you cant realy tell as 50cent seems to have put in his own style which i thinks great. the albums done extremely well due to it been rather radio friendly so if you are a hard core classics hip-hop fan like myself, give the album a miss unless you pick it up for dirt cheap.", "label": 2}
{"text": "The Slim Shady LP is Eminem's first album. It was released quite a few years ago and features the hit single, \"My name is...\n... Slim Shady\".  Here's a rating of the tracks on this album:\n1 - Public Service Announcement - N/A\nJust a regular PSA, nothing special here.\n2 - My Name Is - 8/10\nThis is quite a good song to open the album.  It's basically Eminem introducing himself and talking about things he likes to do.\n3 - Guilty Conscience - 6/10\nIn this song, there are people who want to do something bad, but just before they do it, their conscience kicks in.  Eminem plays the devil, and Dr Dre plays the angel.  There's nothing that intersting about it though.\n4 - Brain Damage - 8/10\nThis song is quite good.  It's about Eminem when he was little, and when he used to get beaten up at school.  He gets brain damage and then gets revenge.\n5 - Paul - N/A\nPaul Rosenberg - Eminem's manager, calls him to talk about the album.\n6 - If I Had - 6/10\nEminem tells listeners how he is upset with the way is life is and what he would rather have.  He also mentions what he would do if he had $1000000, and a magic wand.\n7 - '97 Bonnie & Clyde - 5/10\nSome listeners may find this song disturbing.  Eminem and his little daughter Hailie, go in the car to drop his wife in the sea to \"see how far she can float\".\n8 - Zoe - N/A\nThis is quite amusing.  A friend of Zoe's plays Eminem in her car, and Zoe thinks it's disgusting, so she calls in and gives a piece of her mind.\n9 - Role Model - 11/10\nThis song is brilliant - the best on the album.  Eminem talks about a few things that he does and it's really funny.  There is a good beat, with an exellent guitar loop and amusing sound effects.\n10 - Lounge - N/A\nThis is a very strange skit - it's some men singing about a girl sitting in the corner crying because they brought her to their world - strange!\n11 - My Fault - 5/10\nThe chorus of this is the same as the song in \"Lounge\".  It's about Eminem saying sorry for some of the things he's done.\n12 - Ken Kaniff - N/A\nA nother strange, disturbing skit.  A gay man calls Eminem on the phone to ask him if he wants to share a hotel room.  You probably won't listen to this track very often.\n13 - Come on Everybody - 5/10\nTo be honest, I can't see any meaning to this song at all.  It's just a sort of, dance/hip hop song featuring \"Track 13 Girl\" Dina Rae.\n14 - Rock Bottom - 8/10\nNot too bad.  This is Eminem talking about how his life was completely meaningless, and he had nothing.\n15 - Just Don't Give - 10/10\nA brilliant song!  My second favourite.  There's some guy who introduces the song and talks through it, like a sports announcer.  It's quite bizzare, but I think it's good.  The backing music is also quite odd.  It sounds like a spoon being rubbed against a bowl repeatedly, you have to hear it to understand. Anyway,\n16 - Soap - N/A\nIt sounds like an extract from some romance film.  I'm not sure how it ties into the album though.\n17 - As the world turns - 8/10\nAnother random song that doesn't seem to mean much, but it's alright. It's basically Eminem talking about things that he has to face up to every day.\n18 - I'm Shady - 1/10\nI don't like this song at all.  Some people may find it disturbing.  In the chorus Eminem talks about all the drugs that he does and it's not edited very well.  It's like \"shroomushs\", which is easily made out, and there are other drug references to which are hardly edited at all.\n19 - Bad Meets Evil - 9/10\nThis is quite a good song.  It features Marky Bass - another rapper, and has a good tune to it.  It's the sort of thing you'd hear in a western war movie.\n20 - Still Don't Give - 7/10\nThis song is a verbal assault from Eminem to his critics and litterally, he says that he doesn't [care] what anyone thinks of him and he isn't going to change the way he is.\n\nI must say though, the editing in this album is pathetic.  Instead of leaving a blank, or replacing the expletives with another sound such as a gunshot, the word is simply played backwards and it's extremely irritating.  Also, many words that offend people are left in.  If you are old enough, you may want to just buy the regular explicit album.  I personally reccomend that you get Eminem's latest solo album - The Eminem Show.  In my opinion, it's much better and the clean version is also available in Amazon's online store.\nBig Mutha Trucker", "label": 2}

{"text": "RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, \"Voyage To India\", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.\nIndia Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called \"Growth\" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely true. The second track is an mid-tempo song called \"Little Things\". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a \"call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday\". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes \"Talk To Her\", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and \"talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama\". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (\"It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit\"), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.\nAfterwards comes the mid-tempo \"Slow Down\", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic \"The Truth\", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, \"Beautiful Surprise\", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, \"Healing\" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.\nSubsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, \"Get It Together\" and \"Headed in The Right Direction\". \"Get It Together\" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes \"Can I Walk With You\" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes \"The One\", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.\nNext comes \"Complicated Melody\" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, \"Gratitude\" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, \"Good Man\", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, \"God Is Real\" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track \"Interested\" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.\nOverall Mark: 3/5\nAlthough this is still a great album, \"Voyage To India\" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.", "label": 2}

{"text": "See i will never deny Javier of his talent. But i will deny him on this album because he really does not show it to the best of his abilitys on this album. He has a great voice, and he has a nag for writing really good songs. Not to mention he can play the guitar really well, which is very rare amongest most R&B singers these days. But even despite all of his positives this album lands right on the mediocre line. Its not a bad album, but he could have done alot better. The problem i had with this album is that it all sounds the same. I mean there are a few big shining spots like the single \"Crazy\" and the mid tempo track \"Biggest Mistake\" which tell the tale of how Javier lost his woman. But other than those two standout spots and a few select other tracks this album is boring. He stuck with the accoustic guitar to much on this album. All the songs sound like they were made by low end producers and none of the songs really have a groove to them. He is lacking that song that makes you wanna get up and dance. There is none of that here. Its all that neo soul accoustic guitar type of music, which by the way i love, but not when it all sounds the same. To sum it up real short, Javier has the potential to make phenominal music, he could be amongest the Ushers and R. Kellys with a little help and ALOT more promotion. This album debuted at number 86 on the top 200 albums. Thats horrible for a R&B artist on a big name recorod label (Capitol Records).

If you appreciated the music during the first forty minutes or so of Seabiscuit then buy the CD; you won't be disappointed.  The soundtrack contains pretty much everything up until that point.  Opening credits, Howards bike shop, Frankies demise, the backwoods racetracks where Red Pollard gets his start and pretty much every scene at Agua Caliente, including the all female band at the Molino Rojo brothel.  It's when the major characters come together that the soundtrack starts to fall apart.  The stirring piece from Red and Seabiscuits first win together is nowhere to be found.  Track 10 may be titled Reds First Win but it should be called Reds Second Loss since it's the music from their defeat to Rosemont in the Hundred Grander, a piece so out of context with the rest of the themes it was only used that once in the film.  The anxiety ridden complement to the match race is missing.  Track 14-The Derby (what Derby?) starts out like the match race but there is no slow build up of tension and no release into Seabiscuits main theme as in the movie; instead it goes into that horrid Hundred Grander theme again after a brief pseudo match race intro.  The lovely little guitar bit played while Red and the Biscuit are trotting around the tree during their healing days is another notable omission.

Watching him on the VMAs he dances like a trained monkey in a chorus line, and his whiny voice is nasal, thin, and without any redeeming tonal qualities such as range or beauty or melodic presence.  IMO, only the most tone deaf people would buy this load.\n\nSexy Back is trite, juvenile and unutterably boring, the lyrics sound like jr. high schoolers panting over their personal libido.  At age 25 or so, you would think Timberlake had matured a little and/or had gotten himself a bit of voice training.\n\nNot a chance.\n\nHere is a mean faced guy with a waay nasty attitude who \"dogs\" other artists and criticizes them for having no vocal talent. Talk about Projection!  Timberlake should look at his own stuff before he EVER opens his mouth to sing OR rip at other artists.  Save your bank.

I guess, now that \"Grey Gardens\" is a big hit on Broadway, anyone with any little scraps of information in their closet will be packaging them up for profit.  The tidbits of real information that Little Edie imparts on her interviewer are utterably indiscernable as she whispers them into Walter Newkirks ear. Alas, if only we could  hear what Little Edie has to say as well. I read a previous review that stated the audio was superb and cannot agree with that. I would estimate that only 25% of what Little Edie has to say in this hour long interview is audible.  One of the tidbits of information that was audible, albeit 3 minutes worth,  concerned Jerry Torres. While this bit of information was interesting, I don't think that it was worth the $15. The interview only whetted my appetite for information and left me wanting more. What was she saying? Why can't I hear her when I turn the volume up? Why is she whispering? Is she saying things that she doesn't want her mother who is upstairs to overhear? I am not so certain I would have purchased it if I had known what I was getting.

{"text": "As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.\n\nThis CD has the same copyright protection, called XCP. When installed, Sony hijacks your computer and installs custom software which:\n\n1) Hides itself entirely from Windows by installing as a rootkit\n\n2) Hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with $sys$ are also hidden. For example, if you install the XCP copy protection software on your machine, and rename \"document.doc\" to \"$sys$document.doc\" it then becomes invivisble to you forever.\n\n3) Installs its own custom CD-Rom drivers to hijack your system. It also sneakily names these drivers \"Plug and Play Device Manager\" to seem as if it's a part of Windows. Trying to delete these drivers manually will disable your CD-Rom drive entirely.\n\n4) Offers no uninstall option until you manually contact Sony\n\nAs of my writing this review, Sony has \"apologized\" for this incident, and claims they will \"re-evaluate\" this copyright protection software on their CDs in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, a virus is currently running wild, which names itself begining with $sys$ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners.\n\nSeveral class action lawsuits are also pending against Sony right now.\n\nIn summary, as you can tell from above, Sony's actions here are absolutely horrible. This is your music. You purchased it, and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it, let alone install software which compromises your system security.\n\nThis is one of the CDs with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result, you should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future.", "label": 0}
{"text": "It's hard to believe that while Chicago has been a consistant concert attraction over the past several decades, the band hasn't released a full album of new material since \"Twenty 1\" 15 years ago. Well, the wait for an all-new Chicago album has finally ended with \"Chicago XXX\", the band's 30th release overall.\n\nOver the last 35+ years, there has been a divided opinion amongst Chicago fans over the band's musical style. Many prefer the progressive eclecticism that was a hallmark of their early years while others lean towards the ballad-heavy pop songs that became the norm from the early '80s onwards.\n\nIf your a fan of the Chicago's early years, \"XXX\" is definitely not recommended. However, those who prefer the ballads and catchy pop numbers will be find plenty to enjoy here. The album basically follows the same formula that the band has followed over the last 20 years in that they have created another collection of inoffensive songs that are geared towards radio play and the charts. While this isn't neccesarily a bad thing per se, the album does come off as sounding like a band treading water and repeating themselves without breaking any new ground. Basically, if your familiar with any or all of Chicago's output since Jason Scheff joined, you'll know exactly what to expect here because it's more of the same.\n\nWhat we have here is Chicago continuing to play in the safe zone with a pleasing collection of mostly radio-friendly tunes that'll keep their fans satisfied. \"Chicago XXX\" isn't by any means the band's greatest masterpiece nor is it an excellent album overall. It does have its share of shining moments though.\n\nAs an ending footnote: How about dusting off the unreleased \"Stone of Sisyphus\" album and releasing it to public. Now, THAT would be an anticipated Chicago release.", "label": 2}

He's put together some truly amazing work over the last few decades, and he's one of the most versatile performers around.\n\nAs for his newest CD, there's quite a bit to love, but also several songs to be quite unenthusiastic about. Unlike the other critics, I loved his rendition of \"I'm Not in Love,\" and I wasn't particularly fond of the original. I thought it carried a lot more emotion in Rick's version. I also liked \"Under the Milky Way,\" although it wasn't too far removed from the original. My four-year-old loves \"Life in A Northern Town,\" but although it's a faithful rendition, it also adds little to the original song. \"Miss You Nights\" is a beautiful song, and Rick performed it with a lovely, honest delivery.\n\nThen there are a few songs I haven't been able to bring myself to listen to more than once. Sorry, Rick, but  there was nothing you could do short of using a blowtorch to fix the gruesomely bad \"Baker Street.\" I wasn't familiar with the original of \"Let's Go Out Tonight,\" but the cover was a bit lethargic. And I don't think anyone can do justice to \"Imagine.\" It's just too sacred. Although I admire Rick for attempting it, because if we ever needed that song in our history, it's now.\n\nThat said, I definitely think this CD is worth buying for the fans  -- it's an enjoyable listen, especially if you're in a mellow mood.", "label": 2}

I bought this SACD in high hopes after his stunning Shostakovich Sym. No. 7 with Rotterdam/Kirov.  That recording was made in De Deolen in Rotterdam.  This horrible Sheherazade was recorded in the cavernous Mariinsky Theater.\n\nThe performance is okay, though not as fine as the superb RCA Living Stereo SACD of Sheherazade or my old redbook CD with Dutoit/Montreal (Decca).  Gergiev's tempos are rather fast and I have to give KUDOS to the principal trumpet for some superb triple tonguing in the last movement of Sheherazade.\n\nDespite some fine playing by the brass in the Kirov, I have to give this SACD only two stars.  The sonics are absolutely too closely miked (like many Deutsche Grammaphons), boomy, and way too echoy.  The particular engineers for this Phillips recording needs to take some lessons from the engineers from Decca who record the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam...those Decca engineers know how to deal with lively halls.\n\nIn fact, this recording was so bad, I no longer plan on buying Gergiev's Shostakovich Sym.

{"text": "Music critics have never had much of anything good to say about Jimmy Buffett, and this album in particular seems to inspire negativity in many review columns.  That's too bad, because while Last Mango in Paris doesn't measure up to his 1970s classics or even some of his more recent work, it's about as good as the '80s got for the Man from Margaritaville.\nTo be fair, the opening track, \"Everybody's on the Run,\" really is about as banal as Buffett gets.  But once you get past that one, Buffett's vintage wry humor and storytelling flair are very much in evidence.  \"Please Bypass This Heart\" is classic Buffett satire; his marriage was on the rocks at the time and you can hear the angst in his singing...but still, who else would ever think to compare a breakup with open-heart surgery in such literal terms?  More seriously, despite its goofy title, \"If the Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\" is one of the most heartfelt ballads of Buffett's career.  This one alone is worth $10 for the CD.\nIf it's the swashbuckling outlaw style you're looking for, \"Desperation Samba\" is a great entry with a terrific refrain in (albeit poor) Spanish and hooks aplenty.  Then there's the title track, which is probably the single best of his songs not to be included on the box set; it consistently finishes in or near the top ten in polls of Buffett's diehard fans.  There's also the obligatory Carribbean song, \"Jolly Mon Sing,\" a nice example of his fascination with the mystical and the triumph of good over evil.\nIt isn't the best he can do, but if you've only got it in your budget for one 1980s-era Jimmy Buffett CD, this is probably the one to get.", "label": 2}

Think of a fast sports car on a winding mountain road with one hand on the wheel.

I miss Dawayne Bailey, too -- but life does go on.\n\nPeter Cetera was as essential as Terry at that time -- as good as he may have been, I will forever resent him for causing the group to be pigeon-holed as a ballad group, because that's not what they were ever about.\n\nI'd hoped this new release would be something close to \"Stone of Sisyphus.\"  Alas, it is not.

Kudos to Bill (whose voice is SECOND TO NONE), Jason, Keith and Tris, for their contributions -- they managed not only to step in, but they've made their own places in and enhanced the group.

That our magnificent Creator could bring these crickets creatures into perfect harmony and be able to sing their songs of Love and Praise to God is beyond my wildest imagination.

Also brings to mind the feeling that we may be able to listen to the praises of other insects and other creatures who live to thank the Lord God.\n\nAccording to Wiki, there are over 900 species of crickets worldwide.  That a lot of harmonizing capability.\n\nTracks 3 and 4 are the most amazing.  That is where the sound begins to resemble a Symphony.  There are the sounds of sopranos, alto voices, then there are tenor and some bass sounds.  Perhaps the crickets emit different frequencies of sound at various ages of their lives.  Maybe (just maybe) the newborns are the chirpy, exuberant sounds.  Then there are the sounds of young voices (i.e., a boys choir).  Then mature soprano and alto voices, then on tracks 3 and 4 the mature tenor voices - all intermeshed and intermingled in a beautiful, splendid musical score.\n\nThere also seems to be a prewritten plan to begin the symphony with a few, simple notes - then proceed to more intricate sounds and harmony - and then at the end return to the beginning, pure, simple sounds that linger with you all day.

{"text": "Here are three fine voices recorded on this CD.  But the rationale for why these three would be represented on one CD is not apparent to me.  As such, then, the final product has a kind of non-cohesive sense to it.  However, the three voices, each in its own way, represent some fine vocal instruments at work!\n\nJussi Bjoerling had a wonderful voice.  One example: \"E lucevan le stele\" from \"Tosca.\"  The voice is smooth.  Bjoerling sings this at a stately pace.  He hits higher notes well and cleanly.  Sometimes the orchestra seems as if it is about to overwhelm his voice, but toward the end, he rises above instrumentation with some fine singing.  The final \"la vita\" is compellingly sung.  His voice seems perfectly matched with \"Che gelida manina\" from \"La Boheme.\"  Outside of an occasionally annoying \"cry\" in his voice, his rendition is superb.  He traverses notes well from lower to higher.  The final high note is sung competently.  All in all, examples of a master tenor at work.\n\nJan Peerce had a long and distinguished career.  Up front, I must confess that I never found his voice particularly attractive, but that's just one person's view (and I'm obviously in the minority). One example of his art is Rossini's bon-non, \"La danza.\"  Caruso tried this and lost his breath during the recording.  Will Peerce do better? Yep. He cleanly traverses this rollicking fast-paced work.  His distinctive voice handles the pace well and handles the notes surely.  A nice version!  Then, \"La donna e mobile,\" from \"Rigoletto.\"  Once more, he handles the aria well.  This is a fine version and he hits the final high note well.\n\nFinally, Mario Lanza, the strangest of the three.  He really did not do opera (although he sometimes sang arias in concert or in movies) as Bjoerling and Peerce did.  He was more renowned for his work in operettas, movies, and more popular music.  One foray into opera is \"Lamento di Federico,\" from Cilea's \"L'arlesiana.\" His big, attractive tenor voice can certainly handle the aria.  His continual \"cries\" get rather annoying.  His rich voice handles the demands of this work well.  A higher note here or there might be a bit harsh, but not a great problem.  Then, there is \"Be my love,\" which represents what he was probably most famous for.  His lovely big tenor voice handles this song effectively.  There are those occasional \"cries,\" but this does not diminish the well done rendition of this piece.\n\nThus, we hear some of the more interesting and powerful voices of the mid part of the century,  each singer having his special niche in the world of music.  But, somehow, there is not much of a fit among the voices to make this a coherent CD.  So, 4 stars for the artistry of the singers and 2 stars for a confused concept underlying the CD.  Average it out to 3 stars.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I first saw Nicole C. Mullen on a tour in the early 90s when she was opening for the Newsboys, who were opening for Petra (would that have made her the opening-opening?). Back then, she was simply known as \"Nicole\" and her limited set included athletic dance moves and Mullen's own rapping. Since that time she's become a household name in Christian music with 20 Grammy and Dove Award nominations to her credit (including a Dove win for penning the Jaci Velasquez hit \"On My Knees\").\n\nThis 17-song \"best of\" disc offers a wide variety of cuts from Nicole C. Mullen, Talk About It, Live from Cincinnati - Bringin' It Home, and Nicole's most recent, Everyday People. Also featured is \"Always Love You\" from the End of the Spear soundtrack, and fans should enjoy live versions of \"Redeemer\" and \"Call on Jesus\". Listeners will follow Mullen's journey as she evolves from her safe debut album to Everyday People's fuller, more urban sound.\n\nRedeemer runs the gamut of Mullen's musical styles. From the groovy gospel feel of \"Message to Ya\", the tribal dance rhythms of \"Freedom\" (just try sitting still to this one), the smooth R&B found on \"Without You,\" or the reflective worship of \"Call on Jesus,\" the album is a well-rounded sampling of her talents. The selections showcase her vocal range, and you'll cruise the full spectrum of musical moods with her in this all-encompassing work.\n\nFans of Mary Mary and Out of Eden will find themselves dancing to the beats of several songs, but there are enough slower tempo cuts to appeal to those who enjoy a more reverent feel to their music. Nicole C. Mullen is an artist to keep on watching, and Redeemer will be a great addition to your collection.\n\n--Reviewed by Tracy Darlington for Infuze magazine", "label": 1}
{"text": "When I gave this album 3 stars at one time?!  After listening to AZ, then listening to this, a thought hit me in the head like a Mike Tyson punch, this album is as bad as it gets.\nFirst off this guy bites off everything in his site!!  The album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to AZ's Doe or Die, just longer.  The only reason why he's famus is because he got shot 9 times, and he's a fool on stereroids.  He's all over the media, and is an annoyment on MTV and BET!\nAnyway on the album, his lyrics are childish, and nursery rhymes, along with a lame horrible flow, with good beats, but putting him on the tracks made em sound bad.  He's a million miles away from being Pac, and Ja Rule has a good chance of beating him.\nIf you like pop rap, odds are you brought it, and after reading this review, you hate me.  But for those who like real hip hop, understand this is garbage, and is doesn't even to deserve to be called a rapper from queens(Nas, AZ, and, Mobb Deep hold true to the queensbridge name) it's not even worth 50 cents itself.  It doesnt' even deserve to be on the shelves!!\nInteresting fact:This fool dissin Ja Rule, yet he's copying Ja's style!  I mean he has a fake gangsta image, and club songs, love songs, and he acually sings songs, imitating Ja Rule.  And also, he used Pacs rhymes on the Hail Mary remix from Tupac's songs Hail Mary, and against all odds, to diss Ja while using Tupac's rhymes for exploitation.  What a joke, a discrace, and a cancer to Hip-Hop.(Just like chingy, Juelz Santana(He has good beats, but his rhymes are completly senseless, Ludacris, G-Unit, J-kwon, Bow Wow, and u know who else)\n\npeace", "label": 0}
{"text": "2.5 Stars:  This disc is fine for beginners.  I was hoping for more - the video is about 30 minutes long (which is fine) but for what is covered in the video it could have been 10 minutes long.  Several basic \"lessons\" are repeated twice; once explaining the concept, and once to summarize.  If you or your bird are completely unfamiliar with the concept of foraging, this video can be helpful.  But if you already know a little something, this video probably will not live up to expectations.\n\nThat is where I find myself.  I hesitate to criticize, only because bird foraging is such an important thing for bird owners to be familiar with....so anything putting the ideas out there is a step forward.  However, I have had a bird for 16 years and we regularly endeavor to create foraging opportunities as well as fun toys to play with.  This is not an easy task (sometimes one just runs out of creativity and ideas!) and I was hoping the video would put forth ideas on creating more foraging items:  ideas about different materials to use for foraging containers (that are easily accessible from home or the hardware store), creative ways to put them together, how to make creative constructions that are durable.  Once a bird has the idea to forage, the difficulty lies in creating a changing variety of foraging opportunities so you don't use the same old hiding spots all the time.  This video was not helpful to me in that respect.\n\nFor the price of this video I could have purchased a good foraging toy, and it would have been more helpful for me and my bird.  By buying this video I had hoped to learn new ideas of how to make foraging toys at home, thus saving  money on future toy purchases.\n\nIn my opinion, the video is way over-priced for what is offered.\n\n But in summary:\n\n* Know that this is a BEGINNERS video on foraging and how to get your bird to START foraging. It will be educational for those folks who do not know anything about foraging,\nand who have birds that are bored and have no foraging opportunity.\nThis is a VERY BASIC, BEGINNERS video on foraging.\n\n* Know that the video is 30 minutes long and covers how to create foraging opportunities for birds who may be shy or timid, and who do not know how to forage at all.\n\nIf those things sound like what you need, get the video!  If your bird already forages and you need ideas of how to create more foraging opportunity, look for something else. (and let me know when you find it!)", "label": 2}

Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.  Ms. Voegele has recorded a version which captures what it feels like to have just lost that love and the wounds have not had time to scab over.

For her i would say its her worst record to date (maybe equal to essence for me)....compared to other artists, though, it is still a solid outing, so i give it a C. Lucinda, like Dylan, has set an awful high standard for herself.\n\nI don't think the songwriting is up to her standards and the music is not that compelling.  \"Are you alright\" is tired sounding and unspectacular lyrically.  What was she thinking with \"fancy funeral\"? very strange song.  Seems an odd thing to go on about.  How one chooses to memorialize their lost loved ones is a very personal decision.  It just seems there are allot less seemingly judgmental things to protest in this day and age.  Should we also protest big weddings, fancy confirmation parties and over the top bar mitzvahs?\n\n\"Come on\" may be the lamest song on the record.  Just silly and immature.  What is she 17 years old again?  I guess she really told him!\n\n\"What if\" is again a clumsy song.  Her juxtapositions just don't get it done for me.  That song form is an old, tired and a well worn road.  Her tread marks do little to improve the views on that road/genre of song.\n\n\"Wrap my head around that,\" pun on WRAP (rap), is just \"ok.\"\n\nHowever, there are some high notes: \"Mama you sweet\" is touching, the wordplay is solid and sweet. \"Unsuffer me\" is very good too.

{"text": "I quote the first line from \"Between the Two\", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.\nAll the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, \"Something That You Said\" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And \"Mixed Messages\" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.\nA lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (\"Ride the Ride\", \"Ask Me No Questions\") to crazy (Elvis Costello's \"Tear Off Your Own Head\"). \"Grateful\" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad \"I Will Take Care of You\" sounds like a watered-down version of \"Eternal Flame\".\nPeople say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.\nAnthony Rupert", "label": 2}
{"text": "How can you effectively narrow down ten studio albums and three live projects to twelve songs, without missing several songs?  Simple . . . you can't.  As a matter of fact, at least one of the thirteen projects needs to be completely overlooked.\n\nIn fact, five of those thirteen projects have no representation on this collection.  The live version of \"Prince Song\" from \"To The Bride\" is the only one taken from any of the live projects.  The two hymn collections are also completely ignored.  Even more of a surprise, though, is that their fifth studio project (and one of my favorites), \"Rejoice\", does not have any song making the cut.  Additionally, I think the title track of \"The Roar Of Love\", the musical retelling of C. S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\", was much stronger than the included \"Are You Going To Narnia?\"\n\nBut enough nitpicking about what is not on the project.  The two more important questions are:  1) Is this a fair representation of their career?  and 2) Are the songs on this project worth me buying it?  Allow me to answer them.\n\nFirst, this project is top-heavy on the early projects, with seven of the twelve songs being from their first three studio projects, eight if you count the live version of \"Prince Song\" which is on their second project.  However, it includes one song from each of the last three non-hymn studio recordings.\n\nSecond, while I can argue that this collection could have been stronger, it can't be argued that eleven of the twelve songs (I'm excluding \"Are You Going To Narnia?\", which is great musically but not the strongest message wise) belong on the project.  If you don't have any 2nd Chapter of Acts projects, this would be an excellent investment.\n\nLet me close with a little more info for a person who is not familiar with the group.  2nd Chapter of Acts comprises of Annie Herring, and her younger siblings Nelly Greisen and Matthew Ward.  Both Annie and Matthew have several solo projects each, recording two each while 2nd Chapter Of Acts was still touring together (and these songs would be included in their concerts).  Annie did almost all of the early songwriting for the group.  Buck Herring, Annie's husband, produced the group.", "label": 1}

On the other hand, Eric Stoltz' character was totally unlikable and unredeeming, and due to the deficiencies of the script I could never understand what Rand saw in him either intellectually or romantically.\n\nSmooth, cool jazz and gorgeous nighttime views of Manhattan added to the ambiance, but overall this film came up wanting.

If they were so big into Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, then why does their music suck so much more? 8/10\nRythms - Kind of boring. 5/10\nMotivation - Catchy, but gets old really fast. 6/10\nIn too deep - Worst song on the cd. WAY too poppy and annoying. 2/10\nSummer - Decent song. They seemed to do a better job with their instruments and vocals on this song. 7/10\nHandle This - Alright, but gets on my nerves. Sounds too \"emotional\". 5/10\nCrazy Amanda Bunkface - Faster than some of the previous songs, but not that much better. 6/10\nAll She's Got - This song is fast like the previous track, but not as good. 4/10\nHeart Attack - Alright song writing, just not my style of music at all. 6/10\nPain for Pleasure - The music sounds a lot like Iron Maiden, with the dueling lead guitars and the galloping beat, but the singing doesn't sound like Maiden at all.

I completely agree with the other reviewer that there are still fans waiting for them to come out with something more uniquely Chicago and more sophisticated, something with some resemblance to what they were back in the 70s, before David Foster came along.  Frankly, they just don't have anything to lose after all this time and they should be having as much fun as they could.  Time is running out in a sense.  What on earth are they waiting for ???\n\nBy contrast, another legendary band with a brand new studio album, TOTO, is very much moving forward with their music and heading into some very impressive directions, without losing their distinct TOTO signature.  The name of the album is \"Falling In Between\".  Order it now and 'experience' it for yourself.\n\nAs for Chicago, here's hoping that their next studio album will be just a short wait away, but more importantly, that it will be an outstanding one to demonstrate what these guys are really capable of.", "label": 2}

Call me spoiled, I'm used to hearing really poignant, existential heavy music like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. There's no way a band should be around this long and have such horrible lyrics! I'll be honest when I say, I understand why they never made it big along with the acts of their day...its because they never evolved with the times or even evolved within their own songwriting, like the scorpions or whitesnake and co. that they played the big festivals with. Just plain goofy stuff. It's not that the lyrics are not relevant to today...its the delivery, in which I mean his choice of words, his phrases are things that just don't cut it today. Its like stuff a 9 year old would write. See, the thing about today's music, although some would say its musically deficient compared to old stuff (I say its about the same really..today's recorded music calls for bands to be much 'tighter', as scrutiny is on high in this era) is that its more lyrically progressive as a whole; I attribute it to the early 90's raising the lyrical bar, where the bands coming out of Seattle had a certain style of lyric writing where the interpretation was wide open. They used all the tints and hues of the songwriting spectrum and painted these intense, sometimes even violent pictures with their words. This is where 80's metal failed mostly, as they grasped onto overused phrases, cliches and what-have-you. Of course there were exceptions. Anvil not being one of them, they never became a metal band that could just grip your soul with their words. But I will give them this, I love their style of playing and the sound of Lips' voice...its totally sinister! They get credit for sure, but I can't fall into the 'pity buy' they want from us with those lyrics(which are a HUGE part of what makes me buy an album, alongside the overall sound itself).\n\nLips...dude...write better stuff bro", "label": 0}

The program narrator, Robert Monroe, and the audio technique, hemi-sync, used to induce a sleep-receptive state can be researched at [...]\n\nThe program narrates instructions that lead the listener to a deep state of relaxation.  The listener is encouraged to drop off to sleep at any time.  In the background are surf noises and innocuous tones that produce the hemi-sync effect.\n\nOf the many times I have listened to this tape, I failed to fall asleep only one time and I slept beyond the thirty minutes only one time.  Most sessions I awake feeling sleepy but quickly return to an alert and contented condition before the program ends.  This contrasts with a non-assisted 30-minute nap in which I often awake groggy and remain so for 15 minutes or longer.  I definitely prefer the Catnapper CD.\n\nI should mention that the relaxation achieved at the beginning of the tape is conducive to the body remaining in one position for the entire 30 minutes.  This means I am not prone to toss and turn which would be uncomfortable for the head while wearing a set of headphones.\n\nStereo headphones or stereo speakers placed equidistant from the ears are required to achieve the hemi-sync effect.

Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, \"Acoustic Soul,\" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup \"Voyage to India,\" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, \"Voyage to India\" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to \"love yourself\" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug \"Little Things,\" the sincerity of the love song \"Beautiful Surprise,\" and \"Get it Together.\"  While \"Voyage to India\" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from \"Cookie\" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating \"Unplugged\" set from Lauryn Hill, and \"How Do I\" from Res.

A good rapper can speed up his flow on occasion and slow it down when needed. 50 has one speed and never changes. I support every rapper that disses 50 now, Scarface, Ghostface, Ja, Sticky Fingaz. I really wish people would buy CDs from geniuses like the Wu Tang Clan, Gang Starr, and  Sticky Fingaz instead of wasting their money on overhyped trash like this.", "label": 0}

As an avid YES fan, when I first listened to it I was a bit disappointed as it wasn't quite as 'magical', ethereal and musically involved as YES albums.\nThen I got to the title track and was absolutely swept away. If for no other reason than that song alone, this album/cd is definitely worth the price! In fact, that song has been a comfort to me over the years whenever some tragic event has occurred in my own life. I listen to it to find inspiration and to let the flood gates open in my eyes. If you have a soul, this song will touch it. It is in the tradition of an old English ballad with a progressive touch that only a member of Yes could add.\nStill, the other songs on this album are okay. The song, \"Don't Forget\" is a cute one I particularly like. It's a bit of a throw-back to American pop/rock of the 50's. Otherwise, this album doesn't rate high on my list.

{"text": "50 Cent is the newest rap fanominone since the likes of Snoop Dogg (and his label CEO Eminem for that matter). He has been shot nine times, been in jail, and been stabbed enough times to say he's been through alot to get where he is, and right now, he's the hottest thing in America. For the past years, he's been with his crew G-Unit, with which he recorded several now hard to find albums like \"The Power Of A Dollar\", \"No Mercy, No Pain\", and many others. But, after running into Dr. Dre, he is now one of the biggest superstars in rap. \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" is a sluggish attempt at being percieved as an album like \"Chronic\" or \"Illmatic\", in reality, it comes nowhere close to either of those groundbreaking albums, and doesn't even come close to such albums as \"Doggystyle\" or even \"Ready To Die\". 50 Cent is right now being placed in a pop genre for the hit success of his 2002/2003 singles, \"Wanksta\" and \"In Da Club\", but from hearing the full album, it seems that's not where 50 should be placed. Here's what i thought about 50's \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" album:\n1. Intro - Just a coin falling onto the ground and someone putting the cd into a cd player.\n2. What Up Gangsta 3/5 - Not the best way to introduce 50's sound, but pretty much sums up the sound of the album.\n3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem) 5/5 - Of course, an Eminem produced single featuring Eminem will be good. Sounds somewhat like Eminem's own \"Lose Yourself\", however, another reviewer (i can't remember his or her name) said in a list of the \"WORST MOMENTS IN HIP HOP\" that 50 should stop mumbling so much, props to whoever that was because he/she's right. 50 mumbles the whole chorus, that's not that good.\n4. Many Men (Wish Death) 3/5 - Doesn't come anywhere near \"How To Rob\" but is an alright track.\n5. In Da Club 5/5 - I can still stand hearing this even though the radio plays it 20 to 30 times a day! Great lyrics from 50 and a wicked beat from Dre.\n6. High All The Time 4/5 - OK, not so hot as #5, but this one is definitely worth a few listens.\n7. Heat 3/5 - Another mediocre track from 50, needs alot of work on the latter half of the album.\n8. If I Can't 3/5 - ANOTHER mediocre track, like i said, needs alot of work on the latter half of the album.\n9. Blood Hound (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit) 4/5 - Better than #7 or 8 and has a darker style of rap and beat, the G Unit guy don't make it so bad either.\n10. Back Down 3/5 - Read #7 or #8.\n11. P.I.M.P 3.5/5 - Better, but still consider what i said on #7 and #8.\n12. Like My Style 4/5 - Yeah, finally, an OK track, good thing there was one or i would've never heard the rest of the album.\n13. Poor Lil' Rich 3/5 - Weak. Read 7 or 8.\n14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg) 4/5 - The next radio single, features hip hop crooner Nate Dogg. Alright, but the rhymes are getting wacker and wacker, \"i love you like a fat kid loves cake\"???\n15. Don't Push Me (feat. G Unit & Eminem) 4/5 - An Eminem produced and featured track that isn't good? How? I just really ain't feeling the end of this album.\n16. Gotta Make It To Heaven 2/5 - Pathetic and annoyning, read 7 or 8.\nBONUS TRACKS\n17. Wanksta 5/5 - Another awesome radio single that makes the rest of the album look like junk. A half-hidden Ja Rule diss but very addictive and catchy.\n18. U Not Like Me 3/5 - A rare to find track off his rare to find album \"No Mercy, No Fear\". Don't really care for it.\n19. Life's On The Line 2/5 - 7 or 8.\nIn all, really, really, consider having a friend buy this and you just burn it, it's not a good enough album to get that much props. It's currently topping Billboard's Top 200 Album Charts for a fourth non-consecutive week and has sold well over 2 million copies.

Wildily uneven, 'Zipper'  does deliver ... sometimes. It certainly has more of a rock sound than a couple of his previous releases and the lyrics are at times extremely clever and/or witty. However, some songs do hamper this from being an improvement over \"Special Forces\". Standout tracks: \"I Am The Future,\" \"Adaptable (Anything For You),\" \"I Like Girls,\" \"Remarkably Insincere\" and the homage to 80's slasher films \"Tag, You're It\".\n\nMUSICIANS:\n\nJohn Nitzinger, Dick Wagner, Mike Pinera and Billy Steele ... Guitar\n\nDuane Hitchings and Alice Cooper ... Synthesizer\n\nCraig Kampf ... Percussion\n\nFrannie Golde, Joanne Harris, and Flo and Eddie ... Backing Vocals\n\nPatty Donahue (of 'The Waitresses') ... Vocals on \"I Like Girls\"\n\nProduced & Arranged By Alice Cooper and Erik Scott\n\nINTERESTING FACTS:\n\n1. Released in August of 1982, \"Zipper Catches Skin\" failed to chart on the Billboard Top 200. Thus there was no tour in support of this album.\n\n2. A remixed version of \"I Am The Future\"was featured in the film \"Class of '84\".\n\n3. The song \"Make That Money\" was taken from a planned concept album that Alice was preparing in the late 1970s, which was based on the famous Charles Dickens' character 'Scrooge'.\n\nPACKAGING:\n\nInteresting album cover with an Alice photo on the back cover. CD booklet does contain the album's lyrics.\n\nAPPROX. RUNNING TIME:\n\n30 min. and 24 sec.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS:\n\nNot to be confused with \"Billion Dollar Babies,\" 'Zipper' is still an entertaining - though completely inconsistent - listening experience. *** out of 5.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout \"Jessie's Girl\" to his previous release, SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of \"Imagine\"?  Come on).\n\nTherefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit \"Human Touch.\"  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (\"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Miss You Nights\" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I've been an Yngwie admirer since Alcatrazz. However, after the \"Odyssey\", every time he deploys something new I get the feeling he is just repeating himself again and again, as if he had lost his inspiration. Thus, I must confess that I really expected something more \"out-of-this-world\" in this orchestral release. I was wrong. Yngwie just changed his usual backing army of a heavy metal band by a symphonic orchestra, to achieve just a notable result that I think has no transcendence in the long term.\nThe story is the same: Yngwie furiously plays those licks he has been playing for years and made of him one of the greatest guitar heroes of all times -- but as always since \"Odyssey\", in pretty predictible movements. Just that, and nothing else: barocque-like phrases at the speed of light (most of them based on minor and diminished scales), an impeccable sweeping technique for arpeggios and the cleanest sound a guitarist could ever have. Point. \"That sounds good\", -- someone could say; but the bad things of this release are the compositions, which I find heartless, boring and full of clichs -- his own ones, true, but clichs after all. While Yngwie succeeds in integrating the electric guitar with the orchestra in a smooth way, others like Blackmore have done a better job because they maintained alive the essence of this modern instrument, by exploring its possibilities rather than just playing a bunch of notes on it. Yngwie excels in his performance, but he should go beyond... I just wonder what Yngwie could do if he was more innovative, like Frank Zappa, Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. While he is one of the most gifted guitar players in the world, I'm starting to think that God didn't give him enough talent to compose as a contemporary author must do. He is married to his classic style, and for many people he is loosing his attractiveness because there is no palpable evolution in what he does.

No Beach Boys type magic here, no food for my soul here.  Somehow Mike got the name \"Beach Boys\" probably through some legal battle. So Mike Love now is \"The Beach Boys\" and performs in concerts as \"The Beach Boys\" but without Brian it's worse than one star, it's -1, and without Dennis -2, and without Carl -3, and without Al -4.  There are plenty of substitute \"Beach Boys\" in Mike's band but there will never be the true sound and the true magic that the original members had together.  Mike Love is not The Beach Boys all by himself. I rate this album -4.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Greatest Hits albums are always difficult to rate.  Realistically, no compilation will ever be able to gather every last \"hit\" from a particular artist, and \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is no exception.  And despite its (very few) limitations, \"Essential\" does an A+ job.\n\nFor starters, the amount of material in this package is quite staggering; it extends from the early #1's of the J5 under Motown up to Michael's latest solo work for a total of 38 songs.  Ordered chronologically by single release date, \"Essential\" shows the impressive transformation of a child star into one of the most impressive musical forces in pop-music today.  But despite the stylistic evolution and technological adaptions made along the way, the energy and emotion (neither insufficient nor overpowering) remain at the core of each and every song.\n\nThe first disc begins with the Jackson 5ive's first three number ones, as well as some of Michael's early solo work.  Then, the J5 become The Jacksons, switching labels and becoming disco icons with hits like \"Shake Your Body\" and \"Blame It On The Boogie\".  Of course, Michael finds the biggest success behind solo albums \"Off the Wall\" and \"Thriller\", which dominate the last half of this CD.\n\nBy disc number two, Michael is no longer splitting duty with his siblings and is 100% solo.  \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\" take up all but two tracks on this disc, which makes sense because those two LPs are both studio albums and greatest hits packages, considering the majority of the songs from those albums turned platinum.  Lastly, the biggest hit of \"HIStory\" and \"Invincible\" round out the last two tracks.\n\nNaturally, I didn't take the time to write out all of the tracks from \"Essential\", but just by the few I mentioned you can already grasp at the notion that this collection is pure platinum.  If you're a casual Michael Jackson fan, this is a must buy.  In a couple hours of listening, you'll understand why this man was the juggernaut he was.\n\n\"Essential\" isn't perfect, however.  If you own one or more of the \"Big Four\", then you're most likely better off skipping this.  As those albums make up 90% of anything with \"Michael Jackson\" and \"Greatest Hits\" in the same title, you'd be better to just grab all four of those albums if you haven't done so already.  There are a number of \"Misses\" that you'll be glad you shelled out extra for.\n\nAlso, the balance in \"Essential\" is great.  Solo to group, ballad to dance hit, this is a very well constructed compilation.  Where it fumbles the ball is in the source material.  As said before, Michael's first four Epic solo albums have the lion's share of representation, which means that you now have another CD with \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", and \"Thriller\".  Meanwhile, the under-appreciated \"HIStory\" gets only 1 track, as does \"Invincible\".  Granted, they didn't have quite the effect that the \"Big Four\" had on the music industry, but after doing such a great job of chronicling Michael's discography, the last decade of his career is basically glossed over.\n\nPerhaps an additional disc was needed, which would allot more space not only for more recent songs, but also allow for additional songs in that didn't make the cut.  Just a thought.\n\nRegardless of the complaints, however, \"Essential\" does its job of presenting both 38 great tracks and providing a timeline of the most successful artist to date.  And in focusing on the biggest hits, its only reasonable that some great undervalued songs aren't included.  It's a shame, but can't diminish the value of this collection.  If you're out for the ultimate Michael Jackson hits compilation, this is it.\n\nHappy listening.", "label": 1}

Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read. Dry may be perhaps PJ.\nLess accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.\nHowever PJ. Harvey's Dry has indeed something special about it and lyrically it is very good much better then Rid Of Me but musically it is less compelling and challenging then any of her other albums but it is her debut and if this had only included these 7 songs it would have been an artistic triumph and something that polly jean would be proud of all her life.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I compared this pressing to my Megaforce 33rpm pressing that I bought new in the 80s that is perfect condition. I played both on a high-end turntable (Basis/TriPlanar/Lyra) set-up through a tube preamp/solid state power amp and Sound Lab speakers with a Velodyne sub. Even during the mellow introduction I could tell that the Megaforce was much better. To my ears, the \"original\" (in quotes because it was first issued on a private label) issue's bass was tighter and went deeper, and the highs were more distinct and extended. The double kick on \"Fight Fire With Fire\" was much easier to make out, and with the volume high enough the drums and bass guitar shook my gut. The volume didn't need to be turned up nearly as loud to reach a banging your head experience. The re-issue could not perform these feats.\n  I know they claim that they used the original master tapes to make this new 45rpm re-issue, but perhaps the tapes have aged to a point where they are just plain old worn out. I can't see how this could be, really, because I have many re-issues of other titles and genres that have supposedly been pressed from the original masters that are nearly 40 years old, and they sound fantastic.\n  I was disappointed with this pressing, to say the least. As a big Metallica fan I was hoping that this would be the \"ultimate\" pressing, but no way.\n  I have to hand it to them, though. The thick cardboard gatefold cover is great. The thick vinyl is perfectly flat, and the vinyl surfaces are silent underneath the music and between tracks (when there is an actual space between the tracks).\n  I'm going to play my old version again.

The album presents you with some nice, refreshing remakes of classic Cult fare, some enjoyable new tunes, and even an adventurous work in Siege and Investiture that breaks new ground, bordering, at times, on prog rock.\n\nMake no mistake, though, this album is not a classic in the vein of Secret Treaties, Agents of Fortune, or Fire of Unknown Origen. All of the songs are quality, but none but the remakes are deeply memorable (in that way Imaginos even falls a bit short of, say, Spectres).  The heavy use of studio musicians at times provides a different sound in a refreshing way, but it gives a few songs a bit too much 'generic 80's tune' aura.\n\nI listen to Imaginos on many occasions and enjoy it, but it gets fewer hits in my Blue Oyster Cult library than, I'd say, 5-7 other Cult albums.", "label": 2}

With their 1994 release, Experimental Jet Set Trash & No Star, however, the noisy and innovative messiahs of experimental and alternative sound somewhat burnt out, uninspired and less \"sonic.\" This album was more mellow than its predecessors, which wasn't a bad thing. The opening title,\"Winner's Blues\" is just Thurston Moore, and an acoustic guitar, and although it's just over 2 minutes long, it's a moving song, and the tone of it is pretty melancholy. Even bassist/vocalist, Kim Gordon, toned down her neo-feminist rants with songs like \"Skink,\" \"Bone\" and the closing song \"Sweet Shine.\" Her song, \"Bull In the Heather\" even became a modest hit. Maybe she mellowed out a bit too much, since some of her songs, particularly \"Bone\" just drag on with no focal point or overall sense of clarity to them.

{"text": "Peter is a gifted musician. However, he also is \"gifted\" with long distance mind reading. To become a fan of his is to open yourself up to the possibility of him reading your thoughts and spying on you in the spirit as he is one of the most spiritual people on the planet and is very sensitive. I experienced this and it was one of the most horrible things I've ever experienced in all my born-again-Christian days. He was watching me 24/7 and he let me know it. I'm having a difficult time getting rid of him. It's been over two years now that this has been going on.  It has been quite unpleasant and made me wish I'd never heard his music. I used to be a huge fan. He started reading my thoughts after I began following him on Twitter. I quit his Twitter as soon as I realized that he was in my spiritual space but quitting his Twitter did not help the problem.  I felt like a mangled bug trapped in a spider's web.  All this evidently had to do with a sin committed pertaining to him-a sin that I wasn't even aware I had committed!!  Now, anytime I have any thought about the Newsboys, even if it's a nice thought, Pete hears the thought and comes through the spirit into my spiritual space and makes comments.  I had a nice thought about Pete's wife today and there he was in the spirit making comments and it was making me mad.  Be careful!  Pete now seems to own all my thoughts about the Newsboys and any thoughts pertaining to him.  He also hears a lot of thoughts that do not have anything to do with him or the Newsboys.  I care about his fans and I'm sharing this so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  I haven't even shared everything that was so horrible here that has happened but these are the basics.  If you become a forced partaker of his mind reading in the spirit, be prepared to be very forgiving to him!  I was in it just for the music and I feel I should have been forewarned by someone that I was going to forcibly be made to partake of this spiritual stalking and mind reading.  Going forward, I will do my homework about Christian musicians before I get involved in their music.", "label": 0}

Shuler Hensley, Ivan Rutherford, and Rita Harvey sound good in their roles.  But I didn't feel that was worth the price of the CD.\n\nOther reviewers compare this to Jekyll and Hyde. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. While J&H is undeniably entertaining it holds little in the way of origonality or musical value. Each song is derivitive of another, better song.

{"text": "Now, i am no fan of 50 cent, believe me - but Get Rich actually shows he has, however little, some talent. If you consider The Massacre, this will seem like a classic.\n\nThe album starts with a coin hitting the floor, and a gun being loaded (Intro), which pretty much somes up Fiddys forte. Guns and cash. timing at just under a minute is the follow up (What Up Gangsta), with an introduction to his life, pumped by a grimey beak, and half assed rhymes, with an annoying chorus... a very skippable track. (Patiently Waiting) gives some hope, with a better beat, backed up by Eminems vocals about halfway through the song. If you thought 50 had a great lyrically talent up to now, he seems to be outshined by his mentor. Yet another repetitive chorus, but overall a good track...\n\nA skit to the next track, with bullets being fired, enters (Many Men), which 50 explains how he is headhunted by everyone. he drops lines like 'Im the underground king/ Who aint been Crowned'\n\nand 'Like ali in his prime' - which is a bit to pretantious/obnoxious for me. The single that got overplayed on te radio (In Da Club) chimes next. if you haven't heard this, you must be a tourist from neptune. 50 adds some humor to this catchy track, with some adrenaline pumped lyrics, but still doesnt capture the ears of mine fully. (High All The Time) explains itself - the drug track that can be found all over the G-Unit albums. But this subject has grown old, and the beat doesnt help. Pass.\n\nA beat composed of gunshots, and lyrics remenicent of the gangsta-ish lyrics of the 90's actually works for 'half a dollar' on (Heat), probably the most replayable track on GRODT... with a mildly funny skit at the beggining, and some ad libbing at the end - which don't add, but tie up the seventh track on this LP. (If I Cant) posesses a diffrent kind of rhythm, sounding more like it could be on The Massacre. im not saying its a bad song, just average and samey, with a chorus: 'if i cant - do it homey - it cant be done - now ima let the champagne bottle pop - ima take ya to the top - fo sho ima make ya hot baby' and more 'g unit mentions' that would make you think the CD was skipping at sometimes...\n\n(Blood Hound) features an appearance from G Unit soldier- YoungBuck, whose album i prefer to this one. He adds nothing to this song though, with poor rhyming and lack in skill. And whats with he 'Woof' in the backround? Shut that sh*t up! Check the chorus for a sum up to fiftys lifestyle. with the hit and miss tracklist, we close into the last part of the album, with a diss to Ja Rule (Back Down). But this is no Ether, and you've probably read the same thing in a magazine article. It ends with someone, posing as a homosexual boyfriend of Ja trying to be funny, and failing after the first listen. The next track has one of the best beats on the CD, but suprisingly, was not by Em or Dre. i think it was kuniva of D12, but cant remember right now anyway. anyways, (P.I.M.P) is 50 showing that he does not need the stereotypical Perm or Cadillac to be a pimp. while this song does offer some enjoyment, and an average video, it does what In Da Club does, and wears out,to noones fault but the radio and MTV.\n\nFrom what i have heard, Tony Yayos (G unit ex-incarcerated member) album does not do anything for him, so i won't even bother listening to it, but he features on the next track (Like My Style) if only for a little amount of time - carlessly not showing the rap prowess he could have. (Poor Lil Rich) is one of the dullest tracks on the album, which is a shame as the last three tracks are actually quite good.\n\nThey are (21 Questions) which has an appearance from the master of hooks - Nate Dogg. the beat on the track does sound similar to P.I.M.P but then again, that isn't a bad thing. And finnaly, 50 cent stirs away from the gangbanging-gunslinging attitude splattered on all the other tracks to make a mellowish track which is one of my faveroutes on the album, giving relief from the grime you just expiereinced of the last however many minutes.  To finish up the G-unit features, is Lloyd Banks, and a return from slim shady for (Dont Push Me), an even darker track than most of the rest, and you can hear Lloyd in the backround of the line - 'So Dont Push Me' in the chorus. Now this is the best verse from the G-Unit lot, proving Banks has something to show for himself, outshining his homie, But then Eminem finishes off with an outstanding verse proving he still has it, apart from his 'Oh/No/Yo/Ho' line which ruins it a bit. Still, this song is great, and worth the listen. The album ends with (Gotta Make It To Heaven) - another boring track which should have been left out of the album.\n\nIn short - only about 7 tracks desereved to be put on this album, an average effort from what would become the most Ovverated rapper ever. 50's good, but nothing special. Peace\n\nHadi", "label": 2}

What's so great about it is that the occasional as well as die-hard fan will appreciate this collection for different reasons.\n\nOccasional fan view:\nGreat selections of early (Motown) tracks are on here. The Jackson 5 hits like \"ABC\" and \"I Want You Back\" are featured and tracks like \"Ben\" and \"Rockin' Robin'\" that were some of Michael's first solo appearances are highlights. This compilation also features a few hits from the Jacksons career at Epic Records, including the huge hit \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground).\" The centerpiece of the entire collection is the inclusion of tracks from OFF THE WALL, THRILLER and BAD. Every hit from all three albums are featured here and then some! These hits alone could have made up their own compilation! There is also a very nice selection of tracks from DANGEROUS; including the #1 hit \"Remember the Time.\" The classic \"You Are Not Alone\" from HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1 is here as well as Michael's most recent hit \"You Rock My World.\" Wow, 38 great songs all in one package. This is the best collection of Michael's hits anywhere!\n\nDie Hard fan view:\nOutside of the unreleased tracks, overall this package is much better than the 5 Disc Box set ULTIMATE COLLECTION. That collection contains all LP versions of tracks, unless noted. That was unfortunate for fans looking for the edits of \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" and \"Rock With You\" which have yet to see the light of day on CD...until the ESSENTIAL collection! Just having both of these rare edits makes this package very special to Michael's fans. On the down side, the tracks from BAD are all LP versions, and the \"Spoken Intro\" to \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is STILL missing. (FYI: The only CD I have found the \"Spoken Intro\" version on is the Japanese BAD PICTURE DISC CD.) The selections from DANGEROUS are nice, but are only LP versions or remix edits, which can be found on multiple CD singles. I was unimpressed with the track selection representing HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1. The only track that appears from that release is \"You Are Not Alone.\" Where in the world is \"Scream\"? It is not on here or the ULTIMATE COLLECTION. There has to be a \"Michael Only\" version in the archives (no offense to Janet...much love to her!) I'm guessing Sony still wants to sell HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1 so they leave off from this and every other collection one of Michael's biggest hits. As suspected, only \"You Rock My World\" represents INVINCIBLE. Perhaps there would have been more hits if more tracks were released from one of Michael's finest work. However, THE ESSENTIAL MICHAEL JACKSON is still a must have for every fan!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Here we have yet another attempt at collecting Michael Jacksons greatest hits - the FOURTH in a mere 10 years! Ironically, none of them succeeds. Personally, I don't care too much for the Jackson 5 period - but if they wanted to include the songs, at least they could do it properly and include ALL the hits. Ditto for the Jacksons period - arguedly Blame It On The Boogie, Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground) and Can You Feel It was their best three tracks, but a more comprehensible coverage would have been nice. They should have made 1 full disc only of Jackson 5 and Jacksons material.\n\nFrom this point, it gets better. All 4 singles from Off The Wall is included - Working Day And Night would have been a nice add-on, but it wasn't a single, so that can be excused. All SEVEN singles from the Thriller album is here - good job, that's how it should be in a real 'essential' compilation. EIGHT of nine singles from the Bad album is included - the omission of Liberian Girl can be excused from the fact that it was an UK only single - it was a nice song, though, could've made it onto here. SEVEN cuts from Dangerous is also a nice representation -  they left off two single tracks (Gone Too Soon and Give Into Me, both UK only singles) and included instead title track, which I applaude, since I think it's one of the best dance tracks he's done.\n\nAnd this is where it goes completely wrong. The US release has only 1 (ONE?) single from HIStory, the European version has three, which is better, but not good enough. FIVE songs were released from this album as singles - Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song (UK only) and You Are Not Alone. All are excellent songs. All should have been included. Blood On The Dance Floor had 3 single cuts (title track, Ghosts and HIStory remix and also Is It Scary which was out on promo singles) - none of them are included here. From Invincible, You Rock My World is included, while Cry isn't - which was by far the better of the two tracks. Also, Butterflies was a US hit, but isn't included here - I never liked the song, but it still should be here. Single from latest release #1's, Another Chance, isn't included as well.\n\nThe near complete omission of material from 1995 and later is rediculous, and makes this compilation totally incomplete. They should have made it a 3CD compilation instead: Disc 1 - Jackson 5 + Jacksons + Off The Wall. Disc 2 - Thriller + Bad. Disc 3 - Dangerous + HIStory + Blood On The Dance Floor + Invincible. Then we would be talking.\n\nBut don't forget: This music is some of the best that was produced during the 80'es and 90'es.", "label": 1}

If only 50Cent wrote his lyrics as ambitiously as he strives to appear on television adverts!  Instead of a more pragmatic approach to solve his problems, it seems 50cent believes a combatitave one is the answer, (BACK DOWN).

And though they didn't play the whole song, they did play the solo and the fact that they were able to pull that off got the attention of me.  When some kid I knew was giving away CD's he didn't listen to anymore, along with two other CD's, I picked this one just to see what the boys were made of. Well, I was a bit disappointed.  It seems that though these guys grew up listening to bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden (as mentioned in the song \"Fat Lip\") and seem to be decently talented players, they are either only capable of writing pop-punk music or they were just focusing on what pleases the masses when making this record.\n\nI was hoping to see what else the lead guitarist could do, but I found out there were hardly any solos on here, and the ones that were there weren't very interesting.\n\nThere is a tribute to 80's metal called \"Pain for Pleasure\", and some rap-rock (\"Fat Lip\") but other than that everything pretty much sounds the same.\n\nNow, I haven't heard anything else they've done, and I'm not going to judge them on just one album, if you like simple pop-punk then you'll like this album, if not you won't. That is all.\n\nSum 41 on this album is:\n\nDeryck Whibley (Bizzy D) - Guitar, Lead Vocals\n\nDave Baksh (Brown Sound) - Guitar, Backup Vocals\n\nCone McCaslin - Bass\n\nSteve Jocz (Stevo 32) - Drums", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have listened to all of Steve Gaines's cds, 1) One in the Sun, 2) Okie, 3)I Know a Little. I have actually\nthrown duplicate copies of the latter two cds into the trash simply because I thought the music was so\nhorrendous. People fell in love with Steve Gaines because he played with a great band for a year and a half.\nSteve Gaines became a household name because he first played with Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, the band and\nbecause he wrote some with Ronnie Van Zant. Steve was a good guitar player and he brought a lot to Skynyrd. Steve\nexpanded the range of Skynyrd for a short time. But then too so did Ed King whom Gaines replaced on guitar.\nSkynyrd was always better with three guitars. The three guitar lineup fleshed Lynyrd Skynyrd into a rock\nand roll contender. Sure, Allen Collins and Gary Rossington were great on guitar but something was still lacking.\nThe third guitarist fleshed out the band and completed and complemented it.\n\nOf the three Steve Gaines cds that were released commercially, all I can say of them is that they clearly show\na musician who was making some very non professional or novice music. To my ears the music is mostly quite bad.\nAnd of the choices for songs I can only ask where was this guy was coming from?\n\nSteve Gaines became an instant LEGEND because he DIED after a short tenure with Lynyrd Skynyrd. In that short\nperiod the man thrilled us by being at his peronal BEST. He wrote and sang \"Ain't No Good Life.\" LEGEND, the\nSkynyrd album of 1987 introduced us to Steve's song \"One in the Sun\", which is another decent Skynyrd song. Steve\nalso wrote \"I Know A Little\", and he was involved somehow in \"You Got That Right\" and \"I Never Dreamed.\" This\nwas Steve Gaines at the HEIGHT of his professional career.\n\nNow forget about the short Skynyrd tenure and you have a man playing what, The Holiday Inn or some bar. Ronnie\nand Skynyrd RESCUED Steve Gaines from complete OBSCURITY. And let me say that Steve Gaines served Ronnie well\nin a time when he had writer's block. Ronnie was somewhat exhausted musically when Steve joined the band. Ronnie\nwas the heart and soul of the band. Ronnie was the leader. Steve brought some personal MATURITY to the band. Steve\nhelped with some vocals and gave Ronnie the ONLY REST he ever got on vocals.\n\nHowever, all three of Steve's albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what Lynyrd Skynyrd did\nfor Steve Gaines. Steve may never have made it without Skynyrd. From what I hear of Steve's music I feel the man\nprobably would never have made it. Luckily though Skynyrd FOUND Steve via his sister Cassie Gaines. Cassie is the\none who told Skynyrd about her guitar playing brother.\n\nRest in Peace Steve and Cassie, and all the lost Skynyrd members.", "label": 0}

How many times do we feel that it is hard to pray because God seems a million miles away?  However, Don Moen reminds us that we can sing and this is a marvelous way to start praising God which then leads to closer communication with Him. To see the tears running down Don Moen's face makes you realize how much God means to him.\n\nEvery song on this CD is worth it's weight in gold if you are looking for praise and worship.

In all, 7 of these are top 10 hits from the country charts.\n\nSoundwise, I'm sure it was fine at the time of release. However, since then, advances in CD technology have made it possible both to fit more songs on a disc (up to 80 minutes) and remastering improvements have made the sound quality you can achieve, even on \"vintage\" recordings, much better.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nFor these reasons, I'd argue that your best choice if you want only ONE disc of Patsy's music is THE DEFININITVE PATSY CLINE (ASIN B000002X0P).

The riffs are all 4 bars long, and they all repeat 4 times, and then they all go into a verse for 4 bars, repeated 4 times, and then they go into a chorus.... it's exactly the thing i've come to despise about pop music, and they aren't fooling me. Yes, it's done in a metal context, but these are essentially fluffy formulaic songs that go nowhere, akin to pop. Granted, Soilwork never were THAT adventurous to begin with, but they did what they did so well, that it still sounded great... they came up with great riffs and lead ideas. Now, the riffs are so \"standard\" and the choruses so \"regular\", i'm not sure really what's left to be admired about Soilwork. This is the third stroke downhill for them, even though it is a step up from FNF, and i don't think i have the time to give them another chance.

After listening to \"World Coming Down\" which was the ultimate to me in doom/death metal it was hard to get into this cd. Aside from a couple of tracks it was way too easy sounding plus I started to hear other tones to the music that put me off. Maybe I should have listened to a few other Negative O cds before I got this one but the cut throat sound of Negative O is not on this cd.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I like this song and wanted to add it to my huge music collection, so I purchased it. Keeping all of that in mind, there are a whole lot of Trisha's albums/tracks that I'd put ahead of this and consider \"essential\" tracks too.", "label": 2}
{"text": "No, really--I love Lucinda Williams.  I've liked her earlier albums and I like her voice; it's a nice change in a music genre that often seems to idealize baby-voiced vocalists like Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, and Iris DeMent (all of whom are fine singers, of course, but it's unusual to hear a female singer with Williams' deep, husky, voice).\n\nI found this album musically monotonous.  Really monotonous.  Like, sleep-inducing.  I could chalk that up to personal taste and forgive it if more of the songs had lyrics that were interesting or meaningful beyond fairly standard pop fare.  Too many of these, as much as I hate to think it, were warmed-over rhymes and old themes with no new insight.\n\nGet Car Wheels instead.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Well, if your a ELVIS fan, YOU may like a little Southern Gospel by this man. CD has about all of his popular Gospel songs. I would suggest to anyone that enjoys Quartets sing the southern style gospel music. I would suggest this album to ELVIS fans, he can really sing this style. Came from supplier as quoted on their web sight, well packaged, no problem at all.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Not my favorite Emilie Autumn album but a solid effort. You can hear some of the artists that have influenced her in this collection, but I think her identity gets lost by chaneling the different styles. I still love her lyrical genius though...not as angry as her first full album.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is where it began, the career of Janet Jackson, she was 16 at the time of its release, and who knew that she would acheive so much in her career. While this certainly isn't her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours. Her voice isn't that strong here but its still nice, I mean this is her debut album and she didn't hit it big until Control in 1986, but this is still worth checking out.", "label": 2}
{"text": "If you enjoyed songs like 'What if His people prayed?', and 'We are the body.' Than you will love 'What this World Needs.' Once again Casting Crowns releases a well timed, well produced, well sung cd. With their soft core rock style (that gets me everytime) its no wonder they sell out everywhere they go. I loved this cd. Instead of being another worship band (which is not a bad thing) Casting crowns continues to challenge 'everyday Christians' to take further steps in reaching their families, friends, and God. And to do so we need to take that first step of looking at ourselves in the mirror.", "label": 1}

There is really no talent and musically not fulfilling, I ended up giving the cd away because I was so unimpressed, something I never do.  The G-Unit cd is better.", "label": 0}
