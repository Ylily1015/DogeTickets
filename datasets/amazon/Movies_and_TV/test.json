I don't mind the fact that he is cursing, but using the GD word, or anything else that takes God's or Jesus's name in vein is incredibly wrong. I'm glad this nobody was killed in this scene, because he he deserved to die and suffer for eternity.\n\nDo not watch this movie, or any movie with cursing where nobody actors use the GD word while trying to get their point out while using swear words.

I have to  say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only  because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the  portrayals of the lead characters.  In particular, the actor playing Mr.  Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose,  offensive man.  (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the  director).  It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane  could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly  in love with him!\nThe most accurate and well-acted version of this  wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version.  (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production  because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from  the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version  is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's \"script,\" and the  performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely  superb!

Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.\nThis film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.\nI'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD.

{"text": "Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.\n\nAlthough the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.\n\nThis review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This \"Film\" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in \"The Living Daylights\") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (\"Sense & Sensibility\") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of \"Jane Eyre,\" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt.

Nevertheless: I saw it twice with a distance of ten years, and both times I was not convinced by the main theme - the love story.

The characters do not move me: the beast spies on the beauty in her room and tells her lies, the beauty is in love with the family friend Avenant, although as a viewer you see right away that he is reckless and cold. Also, I found the final explanation for the beast's curse far-fetched and implausible.\n\nI guess what makes this film is not logic but the unique storytelling, all right. And I know that I am now probably earning the reputation of an ignorant who has no idea what good films are, but be that as it may, it's my personal point of view. To someone who wants to see an also, in its own way, beautifully told version of this fairy tale, where the characters are not cardboard cut-outs but original and their feelings for one another credible, I recommend the Disney version of the year 1990.

{"text": "I've lately been buying dvd's to fill-in my Charles Bronson favorites, and watched \"Hard Times\" (1975) last night.\nI suppose if you're a fan of Charles Bronson, this period piece from the Great Depression, about a bare-knuckles fighter trying to earn a few bucks from fights (to \"fill in the inbetweens\") doesn't need either another review, or any particular recommendation. The following comments are just to \"fill-in\" a few things about this relatively little-known film, from the perspective of a life-long Bronson fan, who always has thought Charlie could have been an even bigger motion-picture star than he was, given the right vehicle for his unique acting talents.\n\nThe plot of \"Hard Times\" has been well-outlined by the 70+ other reviews already posted to this site, so I won't detail that with more than a brief summary. Suffice it to say, the story is very simple, the outcome rather predictable, and the story also rather brief ( 93 minutes total), and other than for Bronson fans, is likely to have some appeal to boxing fans, and those who enjoy a well-crafted period piece. Chaney (Bronson) arrives hitching a freight-train, and quickly hooks up with Spencer Weed, aka \"Speed\"- James Coburn doing his usual excellent job of yet another suave, rakish opportunist: this time as a promoter of illegal bare-knuckle fights. The rest of the story consists of no more than 4 separate fight scenes, with a concluding one against a hired-gun fighter from Chicago. In between is a side-story of Chaney's relationship with Lucy Simpson (Bronson's real life wife, actress Jill Ireland, who appeared with him in many of his films), a lonely local woman with a husband serving some jail time, and a parallel side-story of Speed's troubles with the local loan sharks, who are after his hide, as he is always in debt from his semi-successful hustling.\n\nMany feel this is Bronson's best acting role, even though I think the Chaney character is rather underdeveloped in this film. This is quintessential Bronson: tough guy with a heart, and VERY few words. For my money, as far as Bronson's acting chops go, I thought \"Death Wish\" allowed him to display a much wider, more believable range of emotions that what he is asked to do in \"Hard Times\". However, Bronson's physical persona has always been his strength as an actor, and in \"Hard Times\", the then 54 year old Bronson displays as amazing quickness of foot, along with a pretty devastating right hand. He's a very believable pugilist, though the two main fight scenes are a bit heavy on the every-punch-hits-the-guy-right-between-the-eyes-yet-he-stays-up thing. What would have made this film a 5 star prospect for me was if the director had made this movie about 20-30 minutes longer, and devoted more time to developing not only Chaney's enigmatic, appealing character, but also those of the several other principal actors as well.\n\nAs an example: Poe (the accomplished character actor Strother Martin) is employed by Speed to be Chaney's \"ring-side doctor\"- we are told in Speed's introduction that he is a good cut man, etc- yet for the rest of the movie, we never see Poe do a single thing for Chaney, during any of his fights. We are told he is an opium addict (like his literary namesake), yet that also never figures into either his character or the story, in any way.\n\nLucy Simpson (Jill Ireland) is given almost nothing to say or do, in her relationship with Chaney. We are led to believe there must be some romantic attraction between the two, but we are never shown any actual romance. We are led to believe they eventually separate because of Chaney's stand-offishness, but that isn't developed very well in their scenes together either. I thought the whole sideline story of their brief relationship could have added a lot of depth to both Chaney's character and this movie, but unless it's lying somewhere on the editing room floor, those scenes jusy never happen in this film.\n\nThe additional supporting actors, filling out the roles of Chaney's and Speed's fighting/promoter competition (Michael McGuire as wealthy-looking promoter Chick Gandil, Robert Tessier and Nick Dimitri as Chaney's two most formidable ring opponents) are done well enough, ironically. The main characters (other than Coburn's admittedly engaging take on Speed) could have used a lot more work, though.\n\nIn all, I'd rate this a 3.5 star movie, mainly for the atmospheric recreation of the Depression Era, and the shots of New Orleans, where most of the story takes place, and yes, the acting of Bronson and Coburn, and to a much lesser extent Ireland and Martin. It's worth watching once, but probably worth purchasing only for Bronson film fans, like me.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see, if it in fact even exists, is a \"director's cut\" of \"Hard Times\", with about 30 more minutes of run time. With a little more flesh and blood tacked onto a few of the main characters, this would have potential to be a real classic.", "label": 2}

For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.\n\n(2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)\n\n(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.\n\nI recommend the following:\n\n(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes\n\n(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes\n\nNote:\nHowever, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.", "label": 2}

{"text": "La Belle et la Bte (Jean Cocteau, 1946)\n\nYou know the story, of course. Belle (Josette Day), the neglected and beautiful younger sister of two wastrel women, once noble but now in somewhat dire straits, goes to the castle of the Beast (Jean Marais) to pay a blood debt invoked by her father. The Beast, however, doesn't kill the girl, but ends up falling in love with her. Then the kiss, and the handsome prince revealed, and all that. You've seen the Disney version.\n\nDon't let that fool you. Disney, as you probably know, oversimplifies everything, and when you put a fairy tale in the hands of a wonderful director like Jean Cocteau, you're going to get a much finer film. And while this is certainly not a perfect film, it does put paid to the puling mediocrity (with the catchy tunes) Disney cranked out.\n\nDay plays a wonderfully nuanced Belle. She's far from the goody-two-shoes Disney portrays Belle as, a woman whose servitude to her two sisters has hardened her. As well it should have. She is honest, somewhat tactless, and a much harder heroine to mindlessly identify with. Her father sees her as a paragon of goodness, but really, if your two other daughters were like these two, who wouldn't? Marais as the Beast, however, is a bit more problematic. I grant you, a lot of the reason for this is that the film's makeup artist made the Beast look more like a teddy bear than The Wolf Man's Lon Chaney. Now, you and I both know the Beast is supposed to be a tragic figure, but really, making his fangs uneven and carefully coiffing his hairdo? The argument could be made that it went with his wonderfully stylized costuming, but were that the case, why couldn't he just kidnap a dentist and have some work done on that left fang? His delivery is somewhat stilted most of the time, but I'm willing to put that down to the difficulty of enunciating through what must have been pounds of makeup.\n\nThe film's ninety-three minutes also gives us less time than we really need to see the developing relationship between Belle and the Beast. With all the fairy tale's subplots needing to grab screen time as well (and Cocteau is almost lavishly faithful to the intricacy of the fairy tale), the centerpiece of the story gets oddly short shrift. Belle goes from abrupt dismissal to wanting to be the Beast's friend in a matter of frames. As the film goes on, things get a little smoother, but those first encounters between the two of them do jar.\n\nThe reason to watch this film, though, as with any Cocteau film, is the wonderful stylization in the sets. The Beast's castle is a wonder of disembodied arms as servants, busts that swivel their heads to follow characters' movements, magic mirrors, and the like. Cocteau wants to use the frame of the story to deliver a visual feast, and he delivers. The juxtaposition of the sunny town where Belle's family lives, which is your basic peasant town, and the Beast's sumptuous, but dark, castle is wonderfully done. Cocteau began his artistic life as a painter, and it shows in his set design.\n\nLa Belle et la Bte ends up being more a visual feast than a compelling story, but it's still worth watching after all these years. Fun and enjoyable. ***", "label": 2}

{"text": "Released in 1983 and directed by Lewis Gilbert from Willy Russells script, Educating Rita is a drama starring Julie Walters in the titular role as a spirited 26 year-old blue-collar woman from Liverpool, England, who wants to improve her life by enrolling in a special Open University class. She meets with her jaded tutor, Professor Frank (Michael Caine), once a week to study great literature. The morose Frank spends his days in a boozy haze and is intrigued by the outspoken Rita as the mentee lights a fire in the mentor thats been out for a long time.\n\nThe plot was taken from George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion (1913), which was the basis for the 1956 Broadway play My Fair Lady, which was in turn made into the famous 1964 movie of the same name. In Roman mythology Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with an ivory statue of a beautiful woman he had carved. Thats fitting for Educating Rita.\n\nI generally enjoyed this drama for several reasons. For instance, I appreciate the locations (Dublin, Ireland, standing in for Liverpool) and the theme: Rita's preconceptions that those in academia lead superior, happier lives are challenged by Frank's failing relationships and pathetic alcoholism, not to mention her cultured flat mate's struggles with severe depression(Maureen Lipman). Despite this, Rita seems to become a stronger person as she learns and adapts to academia.\n\nUnfortunately, the movies lacking in some ways. For one, while Walters is fine in the eponymous role, she was 32 during filming and looked about 35 (her character is supposed to be 26 when introduced). More importantly, the drama just isn't that compelling. I suppose it doesnt help that the character arc of one of the main characters is unsatisfying, even frustrating, but I suppose it could be argued that thats just the way it is sometimes; and it is.\n\nADDITIONAL CAST: Jeananne Crowley plays Franks live-in non-lover, Professor Julia, while Michael Williams plays the dean of the university and Julias secret lover, Brian. Malcolm Douglas appears as Ritas husband, Denny.\n\nThe movie runs 110 minutes and was shot in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nGRADE:  C+", "label": 2}

{"text": "I'd been wanting to see this film for such a long time.  I love the work of Michelle Pfeiffer, Daniel Day Lewis, and Martin Scorsese.  The reviews have always been so favorable for this film and when I saw it listed as one of the 100 5-star movies by a much respected film magazine, I decided it was time to purchase it.  I was sadly disappointed after viewing it.  Although it was extremely beautiful to look at and the attention to details by the art director impeccable, it was leaden and boring.  I agree with another reviewer who said that they were not happy with the odd camera techniques employed...for seemingly no good reason.  It was very distracting.  The acting was sufficient.  I was particularly impressed with Winona Ryder's work.  Never one of my favorites, she was able to convey with subtlety, the turmoil and anger her character was feeling underneath a surface of sweetness and calm.  I wouldn't have thought her capable of such a performance.  When it was over, I found myself thinking, \"Where did it all go wrong and why didn't it work?\"  I wish there was a \"making of\" documentary included, or better yet, a director's commentary, so I could understand better Scorsese's vision and intent for this film.  Some directorial choices were challenging for me.  Overall, a disappointment!", "label": 2}

The original served to remind me why I loved it so much as a kid, and I better appreciated some of the story's depth than I could as a child. Leading into \"Frosty's Return,\" My stomach knotted with dread... not another vile sequel; or worse yet, a bargain-bin knockoff... But I was pleasantly surprised by a weird and surreal spin on the Frosty mythos. From the moment a tiny Jonathan Winters appears in the snow, I had to see what was going to happen next. This version plays on the innocent wittiness of \"old school\" classic specials, but has some nice weird touches, like tiny Jonathan Winters floating on a marshmallow in a cup of hot cocoa. There are some cute \"tip-o'-the-hat\" in-jokes on other animated specials, too, with some clever (not disrespectful) riffs on the Peanuts cartoons, among others. There are some delicious non-sequitors that had me laughing out loud, but it never takes on that awful, dated \"hipness\" that contemporary animated fare falls into (like Disney's \"Hercules\" ... blecch!)\n\nBeing a Heathen, I loved that this \"Frosty\" did not beat me over the head with yet another gloss of the Nativity tale. (Nor did the Rankin Bass original, for that matter.) There was a nice environmental message that wasn't overplayed, and even a reference to the ancient, pagan concept of Yule being a step in nature's cycle, with the promise of life's renewal.\n\nOverall, weird and fun!", "label": 1}

But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying \"groovy man\" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were \"heroes\" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies.

{"text": "This 1997 TV production is called \"Jane Eyre\", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciarn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciarn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.\n\nUnfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.\n\nAs far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: \"I know it may sound silly but....\" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.\n\nThis is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.\n\nEqually lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like \"I feel that your passions are aroused\" are appropriate for \"Sex in the City\", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.", "label": 0}

{"text": "\"Resident Evil\" was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play.\nThe same things are not all true in \"Resident Evil\", the film.\n\"Resident Evil\" tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them.\nIn the case of \"Resident Evil\", it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen \"Deep Blue Sea\" and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as \"Deep Blue Sea\" was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, \"Resident Evil\" is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real \"Resident Evil\" fans like.\nA movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in \"Resident Evil\" did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen.\nThe points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the \"Resident Evil\" video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in \"Resident Evil\"...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in \"Resident Evil\" was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie \"Cube\", the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of \"Resident Evil\"'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it.\nThe other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very \"Blockbuster\" atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other \"creatures\" are plain laughable.\nThey kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still \"Raccoon City\", the train really is identical to the one in the game of \"Resident Evil 2\", (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of \"Resident Evil 2\" (the game).\nOverall, I'd say that \"Resident Evil\" really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! \"Resident Evil\", the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years. Not that bad, but nothing great either.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Being a person who admired the Joan of Arc of our history, I was very much looking forward to the releasal of \"The Messenger.\"  I had hoped it would portray Joan in an updated version. How wrong I was.\nFor starters, the movie ran just too long.  Movies that are long that people don't mind, such as \"Forrest Gump\" are tolerated because they were good.  This movie was just plain bad.\nAside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's \"Conscious,\" it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other.\nThe great disservice this screenplay did was portray Joan as insane rather than having a gift from God.  Only a few \"miracles\" were actually illustrated, such as Joan picking Charles out of a crowd.  Jovovich's portrayal of Joan as a shuddering, twitching mental patient was simply unnerving, not at all enlightening.  Historic reports indicated that Joan was not at all like the movie version -- quite the opposite in fact.\nThis movie is also more graphic than I could bear.  The raping of her sister's corpse was just plain disgusting -- as well as false.  This did not happen and Joan's visions began way before any catastrophe...\nThe Messenger concentrates too much on special effects and the action factor of war.  Joan is dismissed as a saint in this movie and merely portrayed as an insane woman who pretty much got lucky with people listening to her rants.  I have never been so disgusted in my life with a biopic, which is usually what we expect -- a factual version of a historical figure.  My recommendation is to SKIP this... and look up an older version of the movie or check out PBS' website for information on specials of Joan of Arc -- they care more about facts than special effects and shock value...", "label": 0}

{"text": "I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.\n\nFirst off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.\n\nOverall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.", "label": 0}

It's a classic of the mid-1970s and defined (and capped off) the era of the independent spirit of Hollywood (captured in Peter Biskind's book, EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS. Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovich, Spielberg, Lukas, Rafaelson, Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty, and even Jack Nicholson brought a European sensibility to Hollywood during the late 60s and early 70s. In some ways, TAXI DRIVER (1976) represented the end of that era, even as JAWS (released the year before) signaled the new direction Hollywood would go in -- and still goes in -- to the great detriment of American film.

It's such  a cop out.  It's like they're telling you, the third in the series is  coming out.  Unfortunately, this particular series should probably stop.  I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.  First of all, anyone who knows their  geography will get a big clue early in the film.  Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the \"I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie.\"  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the \"Reanimator\" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.  It could  have been a lot better, but it's too predictable and a little too gory, as  well.

{"text": "This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever \"rags to riches\" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who\ndistinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.\nThe production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the \"rape\", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.\nThe performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his \"body language\" often outdoes his spoken  one.\nThere are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of \"7 years\",  is not always the most probable one.\nBut overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.", "label": 1}

As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.

{"text": "As a huge fan of the original games I came to the first Resident Evil movie with fairly large expectations.  Was I disappointed, a little.  As a horror movie it had its moments, as a movie based on a game it wasn't very great.  Although, to lend it some credit, Paul Anderson has said it was more of a prequel to the games rather than based exactly on the games.\n\nLuckily Resident Evil: Apocalypse is based on the games and is a lot better done than the first one. First off, there's a lot more action. To me the first one was far to slow, with not much going on. This one was almost pure action through and through. It had great gun fights and well thought out fisticuffs.\n\nIt also played out like the games, with different scenes from the game actually in the movie, which I enjoyed. The Tyrant was well done and didn't look too cheesy like I thought it would.  The zombies were good, although the moments where the director chose to slow down the film to show groups of zombies moving was a total waste.  I couldn't help but think, \"cheesy TV movie\" during those times.  The dogs and lickers were well done, and there's nothing like a creepy classroom filled with zombie children to get some chills wrung out.\n\nMilla Jovavich's character Alice was a big improvement too.  Jovavich had a better grasp of the character this time around and played her with some good old camp too.  She seemed more confident in the role, which worked for the movie.\n\nMy only real complaints about the movie where its lack of constant good scares, only one new addition of the monsters from the game(the Tyrant) and lack of gore. For a horror zombie movie you'd expect a little more gore.  Even Shaun of the Dead has more gore than this. But overall, it's a step above the original, and a gigantic leap over other zombie movies based off games.  Yeah, I'm talking about you House of the Dead.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra) is a two-bit night club singer, womanizer, and cad.  He lands in a San Francisco saloon and starts romancing a wealthy older woman (Rita Hayworth) and sweet chorus girl (Kim Novak).\n\nWhen I saw this movie in 1957 I fell head over heels for Frank and the sophisticated night club scene, but now Frank's Joey seems like a heartless sleaze, the clubs are cheap, and the movie is hopelessly dated.  It was made at the height of Frank's ring-a-ding-ding movie popularity, though, and he still charms despite playing a mean-spirited and selfish loser who is outweighed by both of his co-stars.  Poor Rita looks drab and tired, a far cry from her earlier glory days.  Kim is lovely (without those thick eyebrows from \"Vertigo\"), but her singing voice is a disaster and she isn't much of a dancer.  A beatnik-style dance featuring both ladies is just embarrassing.\n\nOn the plus side, the songs are terrific.  The show is filled with memorable Rodgers and Hart tunes such as \"The Lady is a Tramp,\" \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,\" \"I Could Write a Book,\" \"There's a Small Hotel,\" and \"My Funny Valentine.\"\n\nThe movie is glossy and pretty with lavish gowns and furs and picturesque San Francisco as a location, but is definitely a product of its time.  What was once ultra-cool and sophisticated now seems tawdry and pathetic.  Good songs, though.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I agree with the other reviewers here in that this film does not represent the best work of its stars, and the movie as a whole probably fell short of its aims. But there are too many good (and highly original) scenes too write it off altogether. (eg. the optical illusion looking down on Emma Peel as she tries to escape down a staircase yet ends up on the same floor).\n\nAlso, the romantic restraint of the two lead characters makes a refreshing change from the contemporary norm, which is either based on tease & innuendo, or can't-wait-to-rip-each-others-clothes-off.\n\nAs for the teddy bears scene that has been so blasted, I found it so unexpected & bizarre that I had to laugh. And surely that was the intention of the film...\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed it. Just watch it with an open mind and, for God's sake, don't take it seriously. I especially recommend this film if you are a fan of English architecture (there are some great shots of interiors & exteriors of both modern & historical), or a sucker for Uma Thurman's stylish warmth (like me :))", "label": 2}

{"text": "Sometimes, a good movie is the victim of inordinate amounts of praise and accolades by people who think it would be \"uncool\" of them to say anything negative.  Heaven forbid these in-crowd wannabes would say  anything to break from the pack.  So, instead, they pile on the  superlatives to the point of no return.  As a result, new audiences end up  feeling extremely disappointed when they finally do see the film because  there's no way it can live up to the high expectations these reviewers have  given it.\nWell, I'm not one of those, so I'll say it like it is:  \"Wages Of Fear\" is a *very* good movie, but it's far from being  THE suspense movie to end all suspense movies as some here would have you  believe.  The newly-restored director's cut clocks in at a whopping 148  minutes, of which the first 46 minutes go by very s-l-o-w-l-y.  The  characters are being set up and developed during this time, but some of it  does drag and even then there are some unanswered questions as to who,  what, where, and why.\nIt's easy to see why parts of this film were  censored for its US release back in 1954: the picture that Clouzot paints  of American corporations and their heartless greed is not pretty indeed.  Even today, the dialog used by the oil-company foreman in his decision to  use non-union workers stings and shocks.\nThe story's pace picks up once  our four main characters get on the road with their charge of nitro.  Most  of the action is completely unexpected (a very good thing), some of it is  boringly obvious (not so good thing), and a bit here and there just isn't  explained very well (a bad thing).  Bimba and Luigi are believable as  characters and they endear themselves to the viewer immediately.  You just  love these guys.  Jo and Mario, however, are the complete opposite.  Jo's  breakdown, fully plausible as a result of what they have to go through, is  a bit too sudden and too early in the trip and renders his character  uninteresting --except for the scene at the gushing pipeline where your  heart will break because of what happens to him.  Mario's selfishness  causes him to do the unthinkable to get his nitro through, but it is this  scene that is the most powerful of the entire movie and which will have you  staring at your screen in complete shock.\nWithout revealing anything, I  found Mario's behavior at the end to be completely unbelievable and  out-of-character and the story ended much too abuptly (did they run out of  film?).  A very disappointing end to such a good movie.\nThe Criterion  edition is bare-bones: no trailer, no dubbed audio track, no interview,  nothing.  There are English subtitles, but they are not all that accurate.  The film has been remastered so it's clear, except for a vertical white  line that appears on and off for what seems to be the major part of the  film.  It's not all that obtrusive, but considering this is a Criterion  release it's surprising it's there at all!\nI give this 3 stars:  4  stars for the film (despite its several flaws, it is engaging and  suspenseful and well worth owning) minus 1 star for the poor bare-bones  Criterion edition (with a ... list price, you'd think they could give  more).", "label": 2}

Just some thoughts on this vampire movie...\n\nFright Night (1985) is a cheesy vampire movie that blends horror and humor and is straight from the heart of the 1980s.  The best performance is by Roddy McDowall, who plays a vampire hunter.  Personally, I don't really care for vampire movies that are campy.  I like my vampire movies scary and more serious, such as my all-time favorite vampire movie, Salem's Lot (1979).  Or, a lot of the Dracula movies over the years.  Some of the Hammer vampire and Dracula movies have moments of borderline cheesiness, however, it's all made up for with serious horror, scary vampires, and lots of blood.\n\nFright Night does not make my list of \"My Top 13 Vampire Movies\".  I would rank Fright Night probably 20-something at best.  It's a decent movie, but not one I would want to watch multiple times.  I must say, though, that it's FAR better than those horrible Twilight movies.  I would rank those Twilight movies around 224th on my list of favorite vampire movies.", "label": 2}

{"text": "On a cinematic level, Midnight Express is an extremely powerful movie.  It has a terrific, moving soundtrack.  The acting is terrific.  The late Brad Davis, who played the lead in this film, threw away what could have been a  fantastic acting career because of his own drug use.  (The actor was pretty  much blackballed after he gained a reputation for showing up to Hollywood  parties and  film shootings stoned.  He eventually died of AIDS.)  Some of  the speeches in the film are extremely powerful.  However, the main  character is simply put, a drug smuggler who got caught.  The movie does an  excellent job of making him extremely sympathetic.  If you purchase the  newest edition, there's a brief documentary on the real life Billy Hayes.  I find his general lack of remorse most interesting.  Additionally, the  movie takes some liberties with the facts.  From what I understand, the  first half of the film is fairly accurate.  He did caught smuggling drugs  out of turkey.  He was sent to prison.  He did get his feet beaten with a  club, and was hit in the groin with the club.  (He was not raped, as many  reviewers have indicated.)  When he had less than two months left on his  sentence, he was sentenced to more time.  However, it wasn't another 30  years, like the movie indicates.  Between time off for good behavior, a  partial amnesty to all prisoners, and time served from his first sentence,  Billy Hayes had roughly 3 years left when he escaped.  The extreme  brutality in the last third of the film is simply the product of Oliver  Stone's imagination.  In fact, Billy Hayes has said that he'd like to make  another movie to properly reflect what really happened.  (Personally, I  think he's just trying to profit more from his crime.) Many reviewers have  complained about the brutal way the prisons are portrayed.  This movie is  certainly exaggerated.  However, prisons are brutal places.  Additionally,  the Turks do beat prisoners on the feet.  As another reviewer commented,  it's worse than the U.S., but not as bad as other countries.  I'd like to  refer you to a previous customer review in which the reviewer hypothesizes  what would have had happened if he hadn't been caught.", "label": 2}
{"text": "This is my favorite film on the life of Jesus.  It is based on the Gospel of Luke.  Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.\n\nIt is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that \"they are for the children\" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks \"who acted as this man's neighbor?\" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.\n\nIn the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, \"only a mite?\" \"can't she give more?\" \"it's very little.\"  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.", "label": 1}

The zombies, lickers, and devil dogs are back, and there's also a new troublemaker in town (the Nemesis). In addition to some of the characters, RE purists will recognize some locations and/or screen shots that pay homage to the game.

I then discovered a movie, this movie, was made. It took some time to get a copy, and when I finally had opportunity to watch it with my girlfriend, I fell asleep (not really a comment about the movie, but the excessive hours I was working).\n  So now, I've watched it. And... it was clearly in trouble right off the start. In a story ABOUT how several people died on the mountain, the movie often STOPs to remind us with the narration,  that '5 people will die'. The producers obviously recognized thier inability to recreate the actual drama that happened.  I say, \"Don't tell me, SHOW ME\". After several scenes I was left wondering if I hadn't read the book if I would really understand what was happening.\n  Catch this movie on some tv channel at night. Definitely READ Jon Krakauer's book, or even listen to the audio tape or cd. Or wish someone with ability would take this story and make a good or even great movie from the story.", "label": 0}

People who have never  seen this movie would never notice the edits, but if you're like me and you  have watched this video about 5 million times, you will definetly notice  the edits.

Mifune's performance is wooden, the script is overly  melodramatic, and the storyline and direction are okay at best.  The female  lead characters are depicted as pathetic whiners whose lives aren't worth  living without a man by their side.  This whining begins early in Samurai  I, and continues until the end of Samurai III.  I found Samurai II to  contain the best action sequences, and I consider it to be the best film of  the trilogy.\nInagaki's trilogy isn't even in the same league with  Kurosawa's samurai films.

Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's \"my plane!\". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).\n\nMeanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter \"glenn close air force one\". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the \"White House\" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill. Compare the hair, the eyes, the nose, the lips. They could be twins).\n\nTo fully appreciate the absurdity of this movie, imagine it with our real president and veep. Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made.

The way that Milla potrayed Joan  was on my account moving to the point where it has pushed me in new heights  with my beliefs about God and how I react on a whole. She showed a Joan of  Arc that was a teen, a loyal follower of God, and a fighter till the end.  She poytrayed a Joan that in my opinion is a role model in the fact that  she practiced what she preached, followed her heart and faith until the  very end of her life.

{"text": "This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.", "label": 1}

There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark.

That was why I liked \"The Gospel of John\"  everything that was written was either spoken by the actors or the narrator in the movie.  Nothing was added and nothing was taken away.  Unfortunately, I was hoping for the same thing in this movie and was slightly disappointed.

What were these people waiting for to bring a baseball bat down on the heads of these creeps?  If nothing else, it would have given me enormous satisfaction -- I found the unrelenting and indiscriminate nature of the ghosts' vengefulness extremely irritating and tiresome.  Finally, I thought it ridiculous that anyone and everyone who so much as dared to set a toe in the house was doomed (not just in the house, but regardless of where they went).

This 1997 cinematic production is so far off the mark that it shouldn't even receive a single star. I don't know why anyone would like this movie at all. If you have seen any of the other versions, you would automatically find this the absolute worst. If you read the novel, you would find this version offensive, and certainly a slap in the face to Charlotte Bronte. The acting is foul and gross in nature, the plot line is disjointed and patchy, the dialogue is laughable and all together wrong. If you want a good production, get either the Welles version (well done) or the BBC version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke (my personal favorite), but from this production flee now and flee far. However, I do have one good thing to say about this movie.  I teach Jane Eyre (the novel) at the High School level.  I have found that this version is useful for showing students just how far off a film production can be in comparison with the novel.  When I showed a clip of this version to my students after having them read chapter 12 (R-- falls off horse), the students began shaking with convulsive laughter, followed by a hailstorm of derisive remarks that peaked into a cumulative \"that's not how it is in the novel--that's awful!\"", "label": 0}

{"text": "BOTTOM LINE: IF you're a fan of big screen toughguy Lee Marvin, director John (DELIVERANCE) Boorman, or legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, then you may enjoy this. The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray\n\nTHOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.\n\nTHE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber.", "label": 2}

{"text": "If you can switch off the demand for realism from a film for a couple of hours then this is for you. Harrison Ford and Glenn Close start in this Box Office blockbuster about Soviet revolutionaries who hijack the US Presidential place (Air Force One) and the heroic one-man battle against them in the guise of the US President who remains aboard the plane. Gary Oldman plays Egor Korshunov, a trigger-happy terrorist who fires at will and is prepared to sacrifice his life for \"Mother Russia\" whilst Glenn Close's negotiating skills bring for an interesting aside to the main plot. As I mentioned, it is essential that the flying scenes (look for the one at the start involving their return to the air) and rescue scenes are not taken as rigorous to the truth as, in many respects, they are as flimsy as the security systems aboard Air Force One.\nIn general this is not a bad film (after all, the Box Office ratings were good) and as far as typical blockbusters go, I could probably watch it again. Some good special effects improve it and there is always something going on, it could be argued that there are some holes in the plot but then nothing is going to be perfect!

{"text": "I was a fan of the original TV series when the A&E network aired it back in the early 1990's.  I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.  The movie is OK and for that  it ain't so bad.  The missing scenes are needed.  Mrs Peel, we're needed to  find the complete film print edition!", "label": 2}

{"text": "Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.\n\nFirst off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way \"Toys\" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.\n\nThen there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named \"Evil Peel,\" and gets to say the line, \"You just saved me from myself.\" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the \"funnier\" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!\n\nIt's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.", "label": 0}

The main story line revolves around a young woman who is willing to risk her life and die in order to produce a baby. Because the central goal of a woman's life is to make babies. Unless you can fulfill this goal, you are incomplete. So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.\n\nThere are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these \"womanly\" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.\n\nWhy this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of \"Feminist Film\" courses is beyond me.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I didn't expect much from the Grudge.  Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  \"When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born\" seems a bit awkward.  The \"grip\" of a \"powerful\" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?\n\nThis challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.\n\nSo let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles (\"The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!\"), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.\n\nThe primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.\n\nHere's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.\n\nThe curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.\n\nThree years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...\n\nThe beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.\n\nThe Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.\n\nI've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.\n\nThe only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.\n\nThe movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for Western audiences.", "label": 2}

{"text": "One hates to get caught agreeing with such insufferably elitist movie critics like Pauline Kael and Leonard Maltin, but their misgivings about the movie Blue Thunder are fairly accurate.  Kael goes too far in calling the film \"Suspense In A Void,\" for its implied argument that the film skimps over characters and plot is unfair.  The film establishes good audience involvement with the characters, helped by the fine performances of Roy Scheider, Daniel Stern, and Malcolm McDowell.\nThe main draw, of course, is the helicopter, a French-built gunship, reminscent of the AH-64 Apaches featured in Firebirds, but sporting a Gatling cannon with a fire-rate of 4,000 rounds per minute, and high-tech surveillance cameras and microphones.  The ship's lethality is demonstrated in a terrific test run by the Army for LAPD brass; the ship blasts away at cardboard dummies representing terrorists and civilians within a mockup of a city block.  The film pointedly highlights civilian dummies getting blasted; the audience thus forgets that, given the hopeless interminging of terrorists amid civilians, the gunship's ability to pick out the right targets comes through as well as can be honestly expected.  It all closes out with a delightfully explosive strafing run of a bus manned by terrorists.\nFrank Murphy (Scheider) is assigned to test Blue Thunder over LA, this over the trepidation of old Army foe Colonel F.E. Cochrane (McDowell).  Murphy and his copilot Richard Lymangood (Stern) test the ship's surveillance capability in hilarious fashion when they stare down the cleavage of a waitress and then listen in on a CHP cop (nicknamed Double Dork by Murphy) in bed with another man's wife.  But then they get wind of the real reason for the chopper's existence when they follow Cochrane to the city's federal building and record a conversation between Cochrane, other members of the Blue Thunder project, and several government types; they've been instigating rioting in LA's barrios to justify bringing out Blue Thunder in a program called Project THOR.  It is a plot that lacks even a minor level of believability or plausibility.\nThe action scenes and cast are good, but the absurdity of the plot ultimately hurts the film.

{"text": "I must admit I'm always a tad suspicious of any foreign movie that gets the artsy critics all excited.  However, I tried to approach The Wages of Fear with an open mind, since I like some of Clouzot's other movies, such as Diabolique.  Critics rave about how suspenseful The Wages of Fear is.  Hardly.  Certainly the premise - four losers driving two truckloads of nitroglycerin across a treacherous mountain road - looks promising, but the moments of suspense are few, and frankly there is more nail-biting suspense in a movie like Speed than in this flick.  On top of that, the movie spends more than an hour setting up the plot, with lots of little episodes showing that the four losers are, yep, real sleazebags, and what's more fun than spending two hours of your life with four sleazebags?\n\nHowever, I must admit the movie weaves its own kind of spell.  It was possible to forget I was watching actors, as the movie gives the impression that this dirty little El Podunco town in South America really does exist, and that these low-lifes are real people, with real dirt and sweat clinging to them.  The four main actors are quite good, especially Charles Vanel as an aging gangster who still tries to hold on to his pride and arrogance even though he knows he is well past his prime (and a coward to boot).  Yves Montand is good as the cocky Mario, and his long and tense ride in the truck with Vanel shows the two men alternately liking and hating each other.  I wish the two other characters, one Dutch, one Italian, were more fully developed, as they seem more likable than Montand and Vanel, but Clouzot seemed determined to focus on the nasty and not the nice.  Clouzot's wife Vera gives a good performance as a pushed-around yet spunky cafe worker who tries to find a little joy in this hellhole.  On the other hand, the American characters - all employees of an oil company (boo, hiss) - are like capitalist caricatures from some really bad Soviet propaganda movie from this period.  The director apparently wants us to like the multi-ethnic people in this fleabag town, but he clearly despises American capitalists, whom he depicts as corrupt and insensitive.  (I read somewhere that, when the movie was first released in America in the 1950s, some of these anti-American scenes had been deleted.  Too bad they put them on the DVD, as they add nothing to the story.)\n\nI wouldn't dream of giving away the ending, except to say that any French movie from the 1950s is bound to be a downer, since the French elites were all caught up in existentialism, that really profound and life-enhancing philosophy, which can be summed up as \"Life's a b*tch and then you die.\"\n\nNot an \"up\" movie, and not all that suspenseful, but it isn't dull, and if you can overlook the nasty caricatures of Americans, the acting is quite good.", "label": 2}

So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was \"added\" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.\n\nOne must wonder what kind of corruption is behind this completely soiled and devaluing version of the story of Joan of Arc and this disgraceful depiction of Jesus.", "label": 0}

I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.\n\nThe real Joan of Arc was zealot that heard voices yet was charismatic enough to rally the French at a critical time and was sold out to the English when her usefulness to crazy ratio dipped too low.

{"text": "The film gets 3.5 stars, the DVD 2. (Hey Wes, no commentary? You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)\nThis film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.\nOwen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.\nThe narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.\nThe strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.\nIt reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity. As far as 1990s indie films go, you could do much worse...\nI recommend renting it first and watching it more than once before buying.", "label": 2}

Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.\nWhile I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!\n\nAs for this particular one:\n\nDon't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!\n\nRochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.\nHow Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.\nBeyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!\n..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!\n_________\n\nIf you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).\nIf time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.\n\nDeep underneath Raccoon City exists a large, secret genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation. The whole site is controlled and managed by an artificial intelligence called the Red Queen. At the very beginning of the movie SOMETHING happens which makes the Red Queen seal the Hive and start killing everyone inside.\n\nExactly at the same moment an attractive young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a deserted mansion - bruised, naked and unable to remember jack... Then she realises the manor is not as deserted as it first looked... And then the film really begins.\n\nWell, as adaptations of video games go, this one is better than most and actually it is a pretty decent action film. Personally, I never liked much zombie flicks (with the only exception being the old black and white classic \"Night of Living Dead\") but this one is quite watchable. Action scenes are not bad, there are some rather good (sometimes pretty cruel) twists, Milla Jovovich is very sexy and Michelle Rodriguez offers a great performance as a Very Macho Commando Girl With Big B@lls Of Fire...))) Also, the Red Queen is a pretty interesting villain.\n\nOn another hand dialogs are not so great and there is little humour. Even if there are some twists the whole story is rather predictable and the ending, albeit necessary for the already then planned sequel, is really silly.\n\nBottom line, this is a honest action/SF/horror/zombie flick, mostly enjoyable because of two main actresses - but it is nothing more and I don't think I will keep the DVD for future viewings.

{"text": "I agree with most reviews of \"The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc.\" While Mila Jovich, or however you spell her last name, is an AWESOME actress, (she was in \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" and all three \"Resident Evil\" movies) I'm sure that this portrayal of Joan is very inaccurate. In this movie she is portrayed as a screaming, annoying and lunatic b****!! What the hell was the director thinking? He or she clearly did NOT do thier homework. I have seen the 1999 miniseries of \"Joan of Arc\" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the \"Joan of Arc\" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in \"The Messenger\" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries \"Joan of Arc\" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake. And I believe that \"Joan of Arc\" is as accurate as any film could possibly get about the \"the flower of France.\"", "label": 0}
{"text": "I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.", "label": 1}

Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (\"You must be Future,\" Slade declares, cowering before him).\nWinkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.\n\"An American Christmas Carol\" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular \"Happy Days\" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection.", "label": 1}

Watch the TV show instead, and let's pretend this  movie never happened (like Mission Impossible).", "label": 0}
{"text": "I had very low expectations for this movie after watching the disaster that was the first Resident Evil movie.  The first Resident Evil movie failed on so many levels: as a horror movie, as an action movie, and most importantly as a decent movie.  A great deal of this failure was due to the poor director selection and the lousy script.  The director, Paul W.S. Anderson directed this movie in a manner that showed both a blatant disrespect for the source material and a poor understanding of the same source material.  As a result of the aforementioned things the original Resident Evil movie featured lousy camera work, the worst special effects since the Power Ranger television program, bad acting, an awful plot, and a painfully loud sound track.  The people who were probably the most disappointed with this mess of a film were the game fans who watched a ground breaking and frightening game series with an intriguing plot and great characters nearly have its movie life slaughtered on the first go round.\n\nWith that being said, a drastic improvement for the second Resident Evil movie was that Anderson decided to work on Alien vs. Predator (which by the way is a run-of-the-mill movie) and left the directing in the hands of a much more capable director Alexander Witt.  Instead of going for suspense and horror of the games Witt directed the film in a non-stop action manner.  This movie unlike the first movie also features characters from the game: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Nicholai Sokolov, and the Nemesis B.O.W. (Bio Organic Weapon).  This time around there's also some comic relief provided by the funny Mike Epps and there are a few locations and scenes taken straight out of the game.  The inclusion of characters from the game, having a few locations from the game, and featuring some scenes out of various Resident Evil games may possibly appease some of the loyal game fans to some degree.\n\nWhile this movie is so much better than the original movie it still has it share of problems.  The first and main problem with the movie is that Anderson is the screenwriter.  With that being the case the movie has no character development whatsoever.  This prevents the audience from truly caring about the characters.  Also Anderson's script centers around Alice (played by model Milla Jovovich) who by the way has nothing to do with the game and the plot of the movie doesn't follow the plot of Resident Evil 3 and the movie is supposed to be a movie version of that game.  The plot that Anderson creates for the movie is mediocre at best.\n\nThe special effects have improved a great deal over the first movie's laughable effects but they still are lacking.  The zombies do not look scary in the least bit.  This is really sad especially since there is a cemetery scene in the movie that features zombies coming out the grave who can't compete with the zombie make-up used in Lucio Fulci's 1980 film Zombi (alsos known as Zombi 2) that features some really nasty looking zombies coming out of a graveyard.  In fact the zombie make-up in Resident Evil can't compete with a lot of zombie flicks: Dawn of the Dead Remake, and Day of the Dead just to name a few. Even Michael Jackson's Thriller video features better zombie make-up than this movie.\n\nThere is also some inaccurate information provided by the movie.  Some of the inaccuracies include crediting Dr. Ashford as being the creator of the T-virus. Also in the movie the T-virus was supposedly created by Dr. Ashford to heal.  If you have ever played the game or like it as Anderson claims he does then he should have known that both of these things are complete nonsense and should never have been written in the script.  The S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team is also represented in a false manner in the movie again Anderson's poor understanding of the games and disrespect are shown by the way they are presented.\n\nOh, well I can only hope that if there's a third movie that the plot is related to that of Resident Evil:  Code Veronica since the series appears to be going in that direction and this would be the next logical step.  I pray that the studio executives wise up and loose Anderson from the production and replace him with a competent screenwriter and that the main focus of the story is no longer Alice.  I also hope that they include the characters of Albert Wesker, Chris Redfield, and Clare Redfield in the next movie.\n\nMost importantly I hope that the Resident Evil production team for the games wises up and decides to work closely with the studio producing the Resident Evil movies much like Konami Corporation is working with the production team to produce a movie version of the incredible Silent Hill game.  If they had done this in the first place all of the millions of Resident Evil game fans who shelled out their hard earned cash to purchase game after game or the various other Resident Evil merchandise could've made the movie a mega blockbuster.  Not only that but it also would have helped to increase interest in the games by people whose only contact with Resident Evil was the movie.  It may have even generated renewed interest in Resident Evil with jaded fans.  All of these things together would have ultimately helped the game make more money.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I thought this movie was ok.  I have never played the games, butI greatly enjoyed the first Resident Evil and I think this one was just as good.  I enjoyed the ethical issues pertaining to Umbrella's cover up stories, etc, and I think it had a lot to offer besides a \"bunch of good guys killing zombies\".  I also enjoyed Milla Jovovich in this film.  Is she Oscar-worthy?  Well, no, but if you're looking for an Oscar contender, this isn't Titanic, ok?  I forget that she basically has had zero movies and, from being a supermodel to an actress, I think she's doing a pretty good job.  Plus, how awesome is it that she's a girl and kicks so much butt?\n\n  I definitely think this movie was worth renting.  In my opinion, it's not a waste of time.  I also, on a side note, thought 28 Days Later sucked in a big way, and the Resident Evil movies were much better.  How is 28 Days Later going to completely rip off Resident Evil and then call itself original?  At any rate, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this film.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The book The Prince of Tides is my all time favorite and  has been since the first time I read it 15 years ago. I finally broke down and watched the movie,  I did enjoy the movie, it was actually better than I thought it would be, Nick Nolte did an excellent job playing Tom Wingo and even Barbra Streisand was a good fit for the character of Lowenstein. However, as I expected this book did not even compare to the movie. I feel like this movie was more about Tom's relationship with Lowenstein, where the novel  was more about the three siblings backstory and childhood. There is so much more to this story then what is portrayed in this film, I have lived in North and South Carolina in small coastal towns my whole life but would have loved for people who haven't had this pleasure to see more of the area in which these children grew up in, would have loved it to have showed more what it is like for kids to grow up on the coast. So many good characters were left out, Luke and Savannah who were big parts of the book we're hardly in the movie at all. I would have loved to see more of these characters in the movie as well as some of the other colorful characters Conroy created brought to life  like Grandpa Wingo and Taletha. I wish someone would remake this movie and add some of these characters and some of the exciting and hilarious scenes from the book, like them breaking into the aquarium and rescuing the porpose,some of grandpas stunts like water skiing and walking up and down the street carrying his cross, Taletha taking the kids coffin shopping would have made a hilarious scene for the movie, they siblings carrying the turtle into the Newberry House, they even took out the backstory of Callanwolde and the way that scene went down was was much more exciting than the book, I could go on and on naming scenes i would have liked to see added to this movie, too bad I'm not a big Hollywood screenwriter lol. The book is so wonderful, through the whole story it seems like you are either laughing or crying, I did not get the same emotions from watching this movie. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone, definitely worth watching but if you have read the novel be prepared for a little bit of disappointment. I'm only giving this movie 3 stars however it may have scored higher if I was not such a fan of the book. if anyone with the means and ability to do so happens to read this please please please do a remake of this movie based more on the book, they could do so much more than they did with the original version with all the advances we have had in film in technology since the first movie was made, I guarantee if someone went about transferring this story to film the right way it would be an absolute huge a hit!", "label": 2}

{"text": "From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it.\n\nThe influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.\n\n'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion\n\n'28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital\n\n'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun.\n\n'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL\n\n'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh\n\n'Aliens' aliens\n\n'Matrix' the action\n\nIn the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting.\n\nFrankly, I couldn't care less about RACOON city.", "label": 0}
{"text": "It is true that the story herein is, to those of us who went to Catholic or other Christian schools, and enjoyed theology and study it long after graduation would be annoyed by this film. Among my 8 majors in undergraduate school was one in Theology, which I loved.\nHaving said all of that, this is a Movie, not a Theologian examination, and in my experience with writers, directors, and producers  often know little of history, or theology. Their goal is entertainment, drama, and creativity. Over the agegis the stories  of such events have changed any number of times, and misunderstanding that regardless of religion the churches tend to recreate and wright out anything they  think may damage their saints. In recent decades the story of \"Joan of Arc\", (incidentally Her surviving signatures are all spelled \"Jehanne\" without surname) have been slaughtered and changed. Never the less, the vast majority of movie goers probably have never read the books of saints, and go out to the movies to see a good action film.\nPersonally, though I liked the movie, despite that it was short, and left a good deal of \"Jehanne's\" story was not even mentioned in this film, it was filled with action, and somewhat exciting. In French her name is today always rendered as \"Jeanne d'Arc,\" reflecting the modern spelling of her first name.

{"text": "Something of a dubious milestone. When it first came out it was hailed as a classic and groundbreaking cinema and it was just as much required viewing as \"2001\". Over the years it has come to be considered as the spearhead of \"form without content\" cinema. Having seen it again since it's initial release, it is something of an embarassment and little more than a misguided curio and observation of a social movement as seen from a comfortable disengagued distance (no matter what people say about Corman, he was still in the business of selling tickets and this was just as much exploitation as \"Riot On Sunset Strip\" was a year or two earlier). Not just for the false notes it hits and stereotypes it depicts, it revels in its own smugness and conceit making, at least for this ageing hippy, a very uncomfortable experience. Sadly, this movie will be judged by many as \"the way it was\" and it will become something of a reference point for viewers and film makers who were not alive during this period to point to as a touchstone of accuracy.

The audio quality is so incredibly varied, you can have somebody sounding like they were recorded live on the day speaking with somebody who sounds like they're coming out of a period radio.

Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say \"brava\" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my \"four star\" rating refers to the \"flashback\" section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?

{"text": "I could give Gattaca a higher rating easily. It's a good movie for the message it conveys and questions it poses. It is just that it is a lower budget film and therefore doesn't have all the visual effects many other films rely upon. This may actually be a strength in that the message does not become lost within the visual stimuli.\n\n Gattaca is about not accepting the society's view of what a person is or can become. Genetic engineering has become the norm and natural birth is the new underclass. Gattaca illustrates you cannot put people into this pigeon hole idea. Genetics only affect the physical and health characteristics of a person, it does nothing for will or desire.\n\nThis film is more suited to an adult audience with the ability to appreciate the message presented. Kids will be bored and teens will probably not care.\n\n It is worth an honest viewing.", "label": 2}

But there is one small problem he gets caught. He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison. Billy leaves a worried girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and sister behind. In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist. The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same. In Turkey who don't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself. Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon. Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away. Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia. Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos. His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out. He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves. Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family.\nThis is emmotional true story.

{"text": "Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here. Note: if  Joan really saw God (and I'm not saying she didn't), I wonder why he  preferred the French armies to the English, there's a religious  contradiction right there. God loves all and doesn't wish war and  manslaughter for anybody. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!", "label": 0}

Until recently, this film has not been widely available and I'm thrilled that Amazon.com has made it more readily available.

(like.. what happened re Potiphar's wife after Joseph became the Governor of all Egypt.. and how did Joseph's brother's explain to Jacob that he wasn't dead after all but that they were lyings cowards who now had to come clean?) I loved that they included the story of how Tamar got pregnant by Joshua even if they misrepresented the tale of how the first 2 sons had died because of their wickedness before the Lord.\nThis movie is not perfect.. not totally accurate scripturally.. ie \" the rains never came but the Nile flooded\" when it only required the Nile to flood.. and the miniscule effort shown re the silos to hold 7 years grain etc etc.. but the story telling was marvellous and the starting from the middle of the tale to tell the story and adding the beginning as an insert.. all marvellous telling of an amazing tale.. the tale of the brothers, and the growth of Joseph and his relation to Jacob was excellent and well played. I have seen Martin Landau in many a movie or programme but he moves me to tears by his portrayal of Jacob and his love for Joseph. I love finding nitpicks in movies and this one has many too.. (ie the Tamar who receives the seal & staff is a different woman  than the beauty who plays her in most of the part) but overall it is an amazing truthful retelling of a biblical classic and if fairly accurate.. even the 'explicit' parts only show the realiry of the situation and any man can be moved to realise how easy it would have been to give in to temptation.. yet Joseph overcame.. Lesley Ann Warren was fabulous as the seductress looking amazing and then quickly becoming the horrid scorned woman.. tremendous.. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar opened my eyes to certain realities of scripture that I hadn't realised before.. and Paul Mercurio as Joseph with his real Joseph and emotive performance.. I found (and still find) the watching a wonderfully emotive and enlightening experience everytime I watch it.. and I watch it regularly.. it is the best of the bunch.. and a classic in it's own right.

Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.

The argument is nothing but a straw man easily knocked down. There is plenty of historical and archaeological evidence to support the FACT that Jesus Christ did in fact exist. The Jesus movie is a good introduction to his life and teachings but by no means comprehensive (for that you need the Bible).\nIf you're sincere in your search for the Truth, I highly recommend reading Josh McDowell's book, More Than a Carpenter, as an easy first read. Available at Amazon.com, of course.\nIt's reasonable to question Jesus' deity if you've only heard the name and never seriously investigated His life. Those who have, including the hard-nosed skeptics who set out to debunk this thing called Christianity, often become Christians themselves. Those who don't generally do so out of mere pride -- an unwillingness to sacrifice their old, comfortable beliefs that allow them to live an ungodly lifestyle. But you reject Jesus at your own peril. It's the very height of folly.\nAs for my opinion of the Jesus the movie? Why not judge for yourself! You can watch the entire movie streamed online at jesusfilm.org in any of 62 languages (of the 858 it's been translated into)!

{"text": "I finally got around to watching this \"landmark\" - this \"generational touchstone.\" After 35 years of cultural saturation - the music, the Academy Award montages, the one-liners - I watched it. Or at least I tried. It was extraordinarily disappointing. I'll bet I \"had to be there.\"\n\nHere's a movie which deliberately portrays late-sixties counter-culture with the \"counter\" component completely missing from the self-awareness of its participants. The characters are portrayed not as culturally savvy human beings who have tuned in, turned on and dropped out, but rather as pie-eyed mildly retarded adults on chrome-moly hobbyhorses frolicking across the country occasionally bumping into folk who misunderstand their unmeasured, playful skinny-dipping innocence. If this film weren't so revered it would be endearing as an interesting museum piece - not as a cinematic record of 60's culture, but as an unwitting artifact of 60's culture. As a film to be revered it fails.  As an artifact it is as successful as a piece of Sumerian cuneiform.\n\nBut the film is preachy - in the non-verbal way that films can be - in the way that the choir can never quite notice. The scene where Jack Nicholson smokes \"grass\" is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Here's an early-thirties ACLU lawyer in 1969 written to act all agog at the sight of weed. \"You mean...mar-i-wa-na??\" he gawks like he's being offered the ignition key to an alien spacecraft.\n\nIn fact the only salient problem with this movie is that it tells a small, feeble lie - and does so in a silly sales-pitchy way. It lies by underplaying the deliberate and wry character of 60's counter-culture in an effort to intersect its participants' motivations with traditionally appreciated dispositions like joy and innocence and googly-eyed curiosity - and it does so with a dishonest straight face. It is the inverse of Reefer Madness pitched dry. All bitternes, measurement and calculation is attributed to the capitalists, rednecks, homophobes and jingos who litter the woods, the coffee shops and the highways. The net-effect this film had on American culture was as a springboard for the American motorcycle aftermarket industry - as anyone who is IN that industry, such as myself, can attest to. Thousands of would-be Captain Americas rebelled against \"the man\" by giving \"the man\" their paychecks in exchange for fork tubes, flag helmets and chopper 'zines. Ka-ching!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Just read the review posted by \"century19@worldnet.att.net\" below.  He hits it perfectly.\nThere are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.\nEasily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then.\nLeonard Maltin said it, \"not  boring, just stupid.\"  No kidding.

{"text": "There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  \"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.\n\nThis miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.\n\nSeveral reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem - and not just one. He's a seemingly ordinary New York cabbie who?s stalking one woman, Betsy (Cybil Shepard) while playing savior to another, Iris (Jodie Foster). But ol' Trav' is just a few coins short of a full meter, a neurotic oversight that will allow him to turn vigilante, threaten the political reelection campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and blow away Iris?s pimp/drug dealer (Harvey Keitel). Suffice it to say, \"Taxi Driver\" is not your feel good movie of the summer. It is a cinematic snapshot of 70s pop culture gone horribly awry, with its crack and whore infested streets, its unstable social setting for easy scores and cheap sex, and a seething underbelly of corruption and dismal isolation as its acrid palette for moral decay. Travis? slow spiral into becoming the loner with a purpose is predicated upon warping the old adage and precedent that one man can make a difference. But when that one man is touched by his own sexual and financial inadequacies, his psychotic inability to bond with another human being and his self delusion - that he is on par with a deity, above the rest of humanity and the law ? then the difference he can make is between destroying himself and bringing about the next apocalypse.\nMartin Scorsese directs adeptly enough, drawing the viewer into this dark world of unsettling realities. The irony of the ending seems somewhat strained and rather a bit like the happy ending tack on associated with conventional Hollywood wisdom, but there is the frightening prospect that with a return to normalcy, Travis? alter ego is, like many a volcano, merely dormant, not dead, and destined to erupt in the future.\n\nThe transfer from Columbia is a rather disappointing remastering effort. There are moments when the color is bold, if dated, and moments when fine detail is generally realized to good effect. But the bulk of this video presentation is riddled with excessive grain ? both film and digital, a barrage of compression artifacts, a lot of aliasing, some tiling, and a considerable amount of edge enhancement. Night scenes break apart with pixelization and exhibit a very muddy color scheme. There's plenty of age related dirt and grit to further detract from your viewing experience. The audio has been remastered - but just barely - with low to no bass and a really screechy high end that betrays the original mono elements. Extras include a 70 minute making of documentary with interviews featuring the director and principle cast, a photo montage, still gallery, theatrical trailer and storyboard sequences.", "label": 2}

{"text": "'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' really does milk the slasher formula.  It's a follow-up to the pretty good 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but the first movie already killed off the only two members of the cast that could act.  The title is also all wrong - shouldn't it be the summer before last?\nThe story involves Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her new best friend (Brandy) win a trip to the Caribbean.  So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.  The fact that's it's storm season leads to a lot of obvious plots involving people not being heard over the wind and a lot of thunder that is probably supposed to rack up tension.  There is absolutely nothing tense about this movie.  The usual round of killings ensue with a man stalking through the hotel, which is inexplicably almost empty save for a few signposted red herrings.\nWhilst the first movie had a tongue-in-cheek yet still fairly creepy script by Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame, this has no hallmarks whatsoever.  Apart from Brandy, who manages to ground the rest of the cast, the acting is dismal.  It says it all when the audience looks forward to the arrival of Freddy Prinze Junior.  The ending is laughable and there isn't a scare in sight.  This isn't just one of the worst sequels ever made but one of the worst movies too.", "label": 0}

They either loved the movie or hated it. I, on the other hand, had more ambivalent feelings. IMHO the first movie was much better. Though, Apocalypse does have some redeeming qualities...mainly the dead dogs are back in action. There is nothing better then zombie canines.\n\nThe movie picks up where the last left off. T-virus has spread and chaos reigns all over Raccoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation is doing all it can to contain the virus, but it's spreading faster then anyone could imagine. In an effort to study the disease, and keep it from spreading, the corporation has sealed off the city. It's then that the real action begins.\n\nResident Evil is full of action. There a lot of things blowing up, bullets flying, and plenty of people dying and re-animating. Not to mention, there is a huge terminator-esque bio-weapon running around.\n\nI didn't find the movie too trying. But, overall the entire venture was short on plot. Events, people and circumstances were left virtually unexplained. Most of the acting was sub-par and just when you think the movie is over it starts off with another crazy hypothesis. It's like the neverening story...and I mean this truly.\n\nI wish I could give this movie more then three stars, but it just doesn't deserve it.

It's obvious that the novel has been carefully thought through and adapted, but it's also obvious that Streisand has re-configured the narrative to place herself front and centre. Nobody expected the entire book to be on the screen, but more of everyone else, and a bit less of Streisand, would have made this film much better, and silenced the most critical critics.

{"text": "Again, instead of allowing his characters to carry on conversations or the visual components of his art to speak, Scorcese, master of the voice over, violates a cardinal rule of cinema and allows the audience to forget the dream of the film by constant interruptions by a narrator.  Now a narrator provides a useful function in written fiction, but only disturbs the delicate fabric of film.  Why is it necessary for the narrator to point out what we are seeing?  \"Newland felt this and Newland felt that\".  This is superfluous at best as Mr. Lewis' visage and gestures, his mannerisms all convey the necessary information.  Why can't Scorcese allow his movies to speak for themselves?  Can you imagine \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or \"Citizen Kane\" with voiceovers?  In the latter masterpiece Welles' has characters in the film speak their voice overs which is what one wishes this director would do.

{"text": "Mostly everyone knows that rarely does a sequel live up to the expectations that its previous installment set up for it. Don't get me wrong there have been quite a few sequels/trilogies that have created legacies for themselves,..the Resident Evil series on the other hand seems to be moving towards disaster. The first installment of the series, Resident Evil, was excellent in my opinion, the story was told in a manner that left you yearning for more and kept you somewhat in suspense. Resident Evil also left you with a cliffhanger wondering what's going to happen next, thus wanting to see the sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I actually waited a few days after viewing the first Resident Evil to see RE: Apocalypse because I thought the first one was done so well that it will be better if I wait to view the second film. So I watched it and honestly can say that I have no reaction, the was absolutely no plot and if you can try to point one out it is probably a very silly one. It seems as if the writers just wanted to push another installment out so they can get to the next one and create a collectors edition box set. Milla defiantely was not aas appealing in the second film as she was in the first Resident Evil. I don't know but a very attractive woman who seems innocent at first then kicks arse later on in the movie is very sexy. In Apocalypse you already know that Milla kicks [...] so theres no suprise and she looks a little brutish while doing so. Kinda turned me off, The character Jill Valentine was very appealing but I feel she got robbed of a decent portrayal, I was confused throughout the movie as to who she was as there was a very brief intro to her. Overall the film was trying to hard to outdo its previous and failed miserably. There was too much focus and shooting 'em up and not enough story or plot.

{"text": "Well, you can be sure you'll be treated to your fair share of glorious Plantagenet hairdos if you rent this DVD. Almost everyone in the (fabulous) cast - even John Malkovich - has one. But alas the hair styles are about the only source of genuine cheer; almost everything else is a let-down.\nMalkovich had a peach of a part as the dastardly, conniving Dauphin, but played it amazingly straight, with nary a hint of the cheeky chappie the role was crying out for. What would Alan Rickman have made of it, I wonder. Or even Bruce Willis?\nHe certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves).\nThe gratuitous violence is a serious blight on the film; the murder/rape scene was arguably relevant to the plot but still was depicted with more detail and relish than necessary, and the remainder of the film overflows with dogs, wolves and crows gobbling human carrion and more battlefield amputations and decapitations than probability would dictate. I'm sure these earned the film its 18 restriction when, fundamentally, it could have quite easily avoided them.\nBut for all the above, I think the main problem with this film is Luc Besson himself. The early stages are laden with meaningless cliches - wolves streaming through the forest, girl running through meadows - and laboured imagery (crucifix, fire, dripping blood and a combination thereof) which get the film off to a bad start from which it never recovers.\nAnd thereafter Besson unwisely tries to have a bob each way. On one hand, he takes the historically faithful/dramatised documentary angle - this is really how it happened, you see - but on the other he plays the dreamy, psychedelic/quasi-spiritual card at the same time. Which isn't how it happened, at all.\nMost peculiar were Joan's visions of Jesus. It really isn't clear what we are meant to take from these: Did Joan really see visions of Jesus (as a boy and - heavily made up with eye-shadow, a beard and a toga - apparently as a member of Slade), or was she simply a paranoid schizophrenic, not in need of an army to march on the British so much as Professional Help?\nBesson doesn't answer this fundamental question, and the introduction of Dustin Hoffman at the end of the film, seemingly imbued with magical powers, really doesn't help. I still don't know what Hoffman was meant to do in the film or who he was. Was he Jesus? Was he Joan's conscience? Or just more evidence that she really was nuts? Or was HE the lead guitarist from Slade?\nAll in all, hairdos aside, a pretty dissatisfying night in.", "label": 0}

Beautiful cinematography and costuming cannot rescue this false, bloated, at times ridiculous, reprise of the story of Jeanne d'Arc. The problems can be  stated precisely: 1) Luc Besson.  2) Milla Jovovich.\nBesson's Jeanne is  a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross.  She  lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for  starting the battle without her.  Similarly, her knights can be found  sleeping late (in full armour!) on the battlefield with the English Army  directly to their front.  The English in their turn are mercilessly  pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis, well...OK. These are just a few  of the film's more besetting problems.

Alternately screaming, squeaking,  pouting and hallucinating...

Now the original grudge done in japan ju-on would've been better but it was a little dragged out and well, i'm too used to american special effects. low budget america and low budget japan are two different things. low budget america means cartoon like computer graphics that glow off the screen and looks like a joke, and japan low budget is like, home video camera and planets hanging from little strings.  don't know how anime manages to rock so much with their graphics but i don't think their film industry's quite there yet.\n\nanyway, so ju-on had too many random characters that all did their own thing and met up with the grudge. it was okay but kind of like reading a weekly comic book series with a new episode and adventure every week. so what america does is realize this and chop it up and cut out characters and shorten other characters parts to leave room for a main character and i'm left even more confused with the newer version than the original.\n\nso now i'm complaining that ju-on dragged, and the grudge was a rushed chopped up piece of bad acted out liver with sarah michelle geller in it who really really disappointed me considering the fact that i know who she is and therefore i want to be impressed by a veteran actress and instead had to sit there thinking how old she was starting to look. that's bad. when i sit there just thinking that you're more wrinkled than you were in buffy that means you need to try harder.\n\nhowever, this is why it gets three stars and not two or one. the japanese version didn't really go anywhere. it introduced the grudge concept. showed off the grudge concept. end. it just did it and that was it. the american version tried to tie it together a little and show why it happened and explained things in a more timely manner. basically like, lets unfold this mystery. this is the mystery building up. this is why. japan was kind of like. this is the grudge. growl. scare. roar. grudge. grrrr. end.\n\nlike i said. both movies kind of sucked. i liked it cause i like horror movies but ju-on impressed me more with the scary scenes even with the lesser special effects and comic book like pace and america kind of bored me in that way with the rushed chopped liver aspect. they just didn't reproduce the scary moments well enough and didn't come up with enough unique ones all on their own. but the end was a teeny tiny bit better in the american version. not the whole end. but the endish area was a little better. however, the bad part was america threw in a really cheap thing all of a sudden out of nowhere that america always does where the main character tries to be the hero whereas in the japanese version she was the victim only. end.\n\nMy whole point? good concept. done badly. japan's was better overall.  should've tried harder or not at all. could've been great i think. they had the right idea to try a remake just didn't give it their all. they should've taken full advantage of our special effects because that's really sad that the planets hanging from little strings in a video camera impressed me more than our own computer graphics.\n\ni also liked and hated the fact that it was also in japan. for godsake's why don't you just use the same freaking movie set and actors for crying out loud. geez. can't you be a little creative?  not only are we gonna remake a movie almost word for word and image for image, lets make it in the exact same house, in the exact same city, in the exact same foreign language. its like, why'd you even bother with an american version if you're gonna make it in frickin japan. just so you could replace the main character for sarah michelle geller?  geez, all you really had to do was glue and paste then.", "label": 2}

The plot goes little to nowhere,and the film seems intent on lulling us rather than informing us. These characters cannot be known by what Redford puts up on the screen;only by what we can infer. If the conclusion of this film is that we truly no no one entirely, then that conclusion has been accomplished here for a most unsatisfying look at a Montana family as remembered by the author.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I wasn't sure what to expect when \"Resident Evil\" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?\nEven though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.\nThe hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.\nAfter these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.\nI am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as \"The Night of the Living Dead\", \"Dawn of the Dead\", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.  Unless you are a hard-core Resident Evil video game fan, or just love a gore-fest no matter how thin the plot behind it, then perhaps this is the movie for you.

Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete.

{"text": "I watched this movie when it came out, and had a vague recollection of it being a dystopian vision of a possible future, where gene testing is used to segment people by caste. That's all I really remembered of it, along with vague imagery of very pretty, very well dressed people going about their business.\n\nWatching it again recently, my impressions are sort of different. Yes, this vision of the future looks like a sort of futuristic Ralph Lauren commercial. The thing is, this isn't horrifying. It's a welcome relief to the eyes to look at a lot of people who keep fit and dress like they respect themselves. Look around you: I see a lot of loud, shambling wildebeests who make me long for this future well-dressed \"dystopia\" no matter how oppressive it might be. Even the cars are pretty cool looking. Bring it on. Probably, this is intimidating to slobs; I found it invigorating.\n\nScience-wise, we know something about how genetic testing works, and what it can do. No, you will never have testing sniffer thingees or finger blood takers that can instantly sequence an individual: chemistry and physics don't work that way. No, we can't tell to a high degree of probability what people will die of. Genes are statistically important, but environment is pretty important in health outcomes. I have lousy genes for strength training: proven by genetic science (though you could tell looking at me before I started lifting weights). Yet, I'm pretty damn strong. I don't even train real hard. Environment. Sure, some people have grave health defects which can be detected by genetic testing: most people don't. And ... why was the Gattica space camp constantly doing the same damn gene test on everyone, several times a day at work? Also, for a society so obsessed with genetic perfection, why can't they breed people who don't have such glaring cartoon-like character defects?\n\nSpeaking of the characters, I have no sympathy for any of them. I know who I'm supposed to identify with: the non-genetic engineered protagonist. He is a selfish sociopathic jerk. He wants to go to outer space. Hey, so do I. I also don't have a life threatening heart condition which could get everyone else in the space ship killed, nor am I functionally blind, which could also get everyone in the space ship killed, since he's training to be a navigator. Finally, despite his bad ticker, he wants to shack up with a girl ... with a bad ticker. Gee, wouldn't it be great to have \"normal\" kids with bad tickers that kill them at 30? What kind of monster is he? The detective: jerk. The protagonist's gene engineered brother: insecure jerk, and a cowardly ninny. The wheelchair bound superman: petulant creepy jerk who has no motivation for any of his actions. Gore Vidal's character: blubber-fey megalomaniacal murderous jerk. Heart-attack girlfriend: paranoid nosey prissy jerk. Maybe the future will be populated by unsympathetic narcissists like in this movie. Reading, say, slate.com, it kind of looks we might be headed that way.

Just remember the story and don't watch it with your kids because they were very accurate about what happened with Potiphar's wife and Joseph's garment being left behind as well as the fact that she had been continually tempting him prior to this encounter.  Also, they kept to the historical feautures in that the women wore fine linen that is fairly see-through.  The only scene I remember being unhappy with was the baker beating Joseph in the prison (Not Biblical) and it isn't 3 days till they are brought out, though it may be that long till the events are otherwise fulfilled.  There were a few other minor changes like that but none damaged the historical perspective. Also, I wish they had included Judah's offer of protection to Benjamin and his, therefore, being the one to offer himself in Benjamin's place.  They show one offer but I assumed that was the other brother who made the initial offer and was refused since it was right when they got back to their father, just as the Bible portrays it.", "label": 1}

Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times.

{"text": "Having read Jon Krakauer's Everest memoir, Into Thin Air, I decided to get the DVD of the movie.  The movie version of Jon's book isn't bad, but I think it falls just a little short of Jon's written account of his climb up Everest in '96.\n\nIn the movie, Christopher McDonald plays Jon; Nat Parker plays Rob Hall, the leader of Jon's Everest climb; and Peter Horton plays Scott Fischer, the leader of a rival group of climbers.  As in the book, the movie details how a lack of oxygen, small mistakes, and Rob and Scott's eagerness to get to the top--and pressing on despite storms brewing near Everest's summit--combined to cause the disaster.  Among the mistakes laid out in the movie were Scott's Sherpa guide Lopsang towing climber Sandy Pittman by rope even though he hadn't been instructed to do so and Jon's fellow climber Andy Harris accidentally turning up the regulator on Jon's oxygen tank full blast while suffering forgetfulness brought on by a lack of oxygen.  Also, Rob disregarded his own turnaround time of 2:00 p.m., which everybody on his team had agreed to so that they'd have time to get back down safely even if not all of them reached the top of Everest by that time.  Indeed, as depicted in the book and the movie, Jon and his guide Mike Groom were the only two people from Jon's expedition who reached the summit and then got off Everest alive.  However, the movie also includes the inspiring story of Jon's colleague Beck Weathers, who, despite nearly dying from frostbite, walked into camp one day after everyone had given up on him and eventually recovered.  Beck, as the ending shows, lost his right hand and all the fingers on his left hand and underwent the reconstruction of his nose, but he still was able to return to his work as a doctor.  The most memorable scenes are Beck's near-death experience and miraculous recovery; the scene where Jon ran out and banged on pots and pans to guide the climbers who had gotten lost after the disastrous storm on Everest; Rob's dying phone conversation with his wife, Jan, who was pregnant and was talking to him from New Zealand; and the closing scene, the memorial service at Everest Base Camp for the climbers who perished on the mountain.  The scenery is majestic, and I got a sense of the climbers' desperation as they struggled just to survive on Everest.\n\nHowever, the movie version of Into Thin Air, in my opinion, doesn't do the book justice.  For one thing, the movie was mainly concerned with what happened on Everest and not how the characters got there.  To be sure, it's hard to get all the details of a book into a 90-minute to two-hour movie.  However, in the movie version of Into Thin Air, we don't really get to know the characters personally.  There's just a brief exposition before the climbing scenes commence.  This is unfortunate because in reality, once they got into Nepal, Jon and his fellow climbers spent quite a while on the trail on the way to Base Camp.  Also, Jon and his colleagues, once they got to Base Camp, spent three weeks there before making their summit bid, using that time to make several forays above Base Camp in order to get fully acclimated. A lot of the characters aren't really well-developed either.  In my opinion, Rob, Nat Parker's character, is more interesting than Jon(as played by Christopher McDonald) or Scott(as Peter Horton portrays him).  Rob's New Zealand humor provides occasional comic relief for an otherwise dull--and eventually tragic--situation.  Also, since we hear Rob talking to his wife on the phone just before he dies, we get a sense of how much he loved his family.  We don't hear Jon conversing with his wife back in the United States, even though in the book, he and Linda had phone conversations on numerous occasions--and Jon, in the book, is the protagonist and author!  I think, too, that the movie understates Jon's emotional reactions to what happened.  In the book, Jon was overcome with grief and guilt at the loss of his friends.  In the movie he's portrayed as a self-absorbed guy who went up the mountain because of personal ambition--and when his friends(Andy, Rob, Scott, Doug Hansen, and Yasuko Namba) start dying, we don't see him exhibit any anguish.  Indeed, in the movie, Jon cracks up only twice:  the first time when he is standing over Rob's frozen body, and again at the very end, when he talks about his dead friends at the Base Camp memorial service.  The movie's portrayal of Jon, in my opinion, is demeaning.  In the book Jon wanted to get up Everest very badly--almost at the exclusion of anything else--but he still grieved for his friends.  Furthermore, I think that in at least one place in the movie, there's some obvious stretching of the truth.  The scene where I most doubt the credibility of director Robert Markowitz and writer Robert Avrech is the scene where Jon, having failed to rescue Rob, discovers the latter's frozen body.  In the written account, Jon did not try to go after Rob because he(Jon) was shivering in his tent and concerned with his own survival.  Anatoli Boukreev, a guide on Scott's team, was the one who coordinated most of the rescue attempts on the mountain.  Rob's body was actually found some time later by climbers Ed Viesturs and David Breashears as they were making their way to the top of Everest.  Also, I think the filmmakers' portrayal of Anatoli, one of the heroes of the expedition, is off base, although the movie truthfully recounts his heroism in the wake of the storm.  Anatoli, as Jon wrote, was a dedicated guide who helped find several of the climbers who were lost, even though he had to descend ahead of his teammates because his rescue attempts used up a lot of his oxygen.  Markowitz and Avrech portray Anatoli as a \"he-man\" type--boorish, uncooperative, and sometimes argumentative.  In one scene, Anatoli and Scott get into a heated fight over Anatoli's responsibilities as a guide.  Although Anatoli got criticized for the way he did his job and for descending ahead of his team after the storm, I didn't see any open hostility between him and Scott when I read the book.  Another discrepancy between the book and the movie is that in the book, Rob didn't see the Taiwanese climber as the climber came out of his tent shod only in his boot liners and slid down the mountain to his death.  The Taiwanese group was on Everest at the same time as Rob's and Scott's teams but didn't go up the mountain at the same time.  Finally, the movie stops after the memorial service and doesn't include Jon's adjusting to life back in the United States.  I concede that the movie is an abridged version of Jon's book.  However, in real life, Jon had to deal not only with missing his dead friends and getting used to being at home again but with the hate mail he received after writing the magazine article which was the impetus for his book.  As Jon wrote, the hatred coming from the pens of his critics made the aftermath of his Everest climb even harder to deal with than it already was.  Markowitz and Avrech completely overlooked this part of Jon's story--and I think that the criticism Jon received, not just for the role he played in the deaths of his friends but for going up Everest in the first place, was a key element in his book.  Still, as an adventure story, the movie Into Thin Air is not great, but it's all right.  The movie, like the book, shows us how people react in a desperate situation and how even little things we do can have big consequences.", "label": 2}
{"text": "My friends and I got passes to \"Resident Evil\" on opening night.  None of us were expecting very much, and we got even less.  We only went for Milla Jovovich, and in that respect we got an eyeful (literally...keep your eyes peeled in the end for a brief but well-worth-the-wait shot of nudity).  The movie's got bad editing, terrible dialogue, an awful soundtrack and a storyline that makes even less sense than that of \"The City Of Lost Children\".  It was a good film to hoot at the screen for (and hoot we did), so I would imagine that it would make a perfect midnight selection for a party. However, if you're even tempted to rent it to watch with your buds, I would recommend something truly campy like \"Death Race:  2000\" instead.

{"text": "Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends  in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.\n\nIn the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.\n\nAlthough I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying \"Suimasen (Excuse me)! BOO! Gomen naisai (I'm sorry)!\" before whisking away. \"The Grudge\" (2004) showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms.\n\n\"The Grudge,\" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.\n\nThe spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: \"when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind.\"\n\nFor Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.\n\nIn many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.\n\nIf a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the \"Poltergeist\" (1982-1986) movies.\n\nTo understand the nature of the supernatural entity of \"The Grudge,\" one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.\n\nIn the book \"Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends\" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie:\n\n\"Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei [ghosts], thus, have an impact on the local environment...\"\n\nThis type of spirit is called a \"goryo\" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.\n\nFormal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.\n\nGoryo were vengeful spirits from the aristocracy who like Sugiwara have the power to affect the very seasons. Another more commonly experienced type was onryo. While less powerful than the goryo, the onryo were the ghosts that kept Japanese of then and now frightened out of their wits. Onryo are typically depicted with wild unkempt hair in a white burial kimono.\n\nAlthough onryo could be either male or female, the most popular onryo were women. Often powerless while in life, these female onryo wielded great power in death. They would wreak vengeance on husbands and lovers who spurned or hurt them in life usually by driving them mad with fear.\n\nDirector Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly onryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. \"The Grudge\" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller \"Ju-on\" (2003). \"Ju-on\" is Shimizu's horror franchise. \"Ju-on\" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought \"Ju-on\" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.\n\n\"The Grudge\" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.\n\nOverall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. \"The Grudge\" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo/onryo-type spirit that \"The Grudge\" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.\n\nOn the Scare-O-Meter, \"The Grudge\" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.\n\nOn Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.", "label": 2}

To us, this gory cold-blooded story of sick mans lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming.\" (Leonard Maltin's Movie Review).\n\nMaltin only gave the movie Two Stars out of Four Stars. In my opinion that's much too low. I will say this: I don't see this movie as Five Stars out of Five Stars or even Four Stars. I give it a solid Three Stars. I liked much of Schrader's script, because he encapsulated NYC perfectly for the time period. In a way I'm glad that I never saw the film before three days ago. It allowed me to go back in time and see things in the city for the way they once were. New York was bankrupt at the time and quite dirty. Harlem was getting worse before it was going to get better and the porn shops had already metastasized in the Manhattan downtown area. This was the world that Bickel was thrown into after Vietnam.\n\nWhat's so interesting is how by the end of the film Bickel goes from being a zero to a hero and that was not even his true intent! His madness begins to exhibit itself when he stalks Cybil Sheppard's character at the beginning of the movie. The supporting characters are solid. But why Foster was given top billing when her character is only in the movie for less than five minutes' screen time in the first hour of the film is beyond me. Sheppard was the more logical choice for top billing in my opinion.\n\nPaul Schrader has been a master at describing the lonely and disconnected man in his movies. American Gigolo and Light Sleeper are quite similar films and deal with men who are loners and have very little going for them in society save for their jobs. Those two films had more soul than this film. In Taxi Driver, despite the top notch performances, I feel that something was missing from the script. Many of the supporting characters were too laconic. Others were too loquacious in my opinion. But I admit that I probably need to see the movie again to understand it better. I might put it at Three and a Half Stars, but for the moment it is a solid Three Star rating. I marginally recommend this film because of the great Paul Schrader's screenplay and Martin Scorsese's fantastic direction. This was my 260th Amazon review.\n\nA. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The chorus goes \"Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!\" Well you get the idea.\n\n REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.\n\n Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.\n\n What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Ahh, \"Iron Eagle\".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/\"current\" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base \"network\" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.\n\nOverall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Back in the day before I became a fan of music and movies I was constantly in front of a TV playing a video game. Years have passed and my attention span for games has seems to grow thinner and thinner with time. It takes a really good game nowadays to hold my attention long enough to get through it. I never played the Resident Evil games back when they were in their prime (though I guess they never really died out). I came back and played both Resident Evil 2 and 3 much later on. I found myself strangely fascinated with both games and ended up beating them.\n\nA lot of you might already know this but it wasn't until a little while later that I was informed that both games occur at the same time, hence the concept for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Be that as it may, both games have thier very own story lines. In Resident Evil 2 it is a split story between R.C.P.D. (Racoon City Police Department) officer Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield both trying to find their way out of the city. Claire is also on a mission to find her brother Chris (who made an appearance in the first Resident Evil game). Various other characters fall into their mismatched story that makes up Resident Evil 2. In Resident Evil 3 the lead role goes to Jill Valentine who, believe it or not, is trying to get out of Racoon City. Farfetched, I know. Through her journey she encounters a group of mercenaries led by Nikolai Ginovaef. The other two are Carlos Oliviera and Mikhail Victor. The catch with this game is it consist of frequent encounters from Nemesis, a beast of a monster set out to kill the S.T.A.R.S. members.\n\nBut this isn't a video game review, that was just some background info going into the movie. The movie's main character is Alice who is awakened on a lab table where she was put at the end of the first Resident Evil movie. Also struggling to get out of the city is Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera and a few other characters. After they all cross paths they are sent on a mission to find a scientist's daughter with the agreement he'll tell them how to get out of town if they find her. Also thrown into the mix to complicate things is the Nemesis and a few angry Umbrella Co. guys who are dead set on not letting anyone escape the city.\n\nWhere they decided to throw Alice into the mix I'm not sure, but it makes for a few good action sequences. Since the first movie, Alice has been given some type of chemicals that have now made her 'superhuman'. 'Superhuman' meaning she can do crazy things such as flips, jumps, run up walls, run at super speed and possess an unlimited amount of ammo.  So since she's with the team this means that they can bash as many zombies as they please and wipe the blood off and move to the next area where they, get this, kill more zombies.\n\nThere's nothing original about this flick and they could've done a much better job at combining the games together (since both had a very subtle story attatched). However, throughout some of the slop they've piled on they manage to work the obvious cliches we've grown to hate (going off into a room alone, monster behind the door or behind a character, etc.) they actually work them pretty well. The movie is a decent effort if you compare it on it's own merit (not along side the games) but becomes way too farfetched for it's own good before it's over.\n\nIf you know what you're getting (which is a done over zombie flick) and go in with low expectations then you just might enjoy it. If you expect not to be scared you might get a few jumps. A good one time through movie that unfortunately leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth before it's over, I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10 (or 3.5 stars).", "label": 2}

{"text": "Here they are, the Insufferable Seven in all their uncensored glory. And  guess what? They're exactly the same uncensored as they are when their  a**es are blurred and their obscenities are beeped.\nIt is kind of funny  that these would-be exhibitionists--especially Teck, Kaia and  Ruthie--didn't sign nudity releases, and so the scenes of them cavorting  nude are still blurred out. How does Kaia expect to get a modeling contract  if she doesn't show some T? Some A? From her riveting personality? And  while on the nudity subject, it's more than a little disingenuous for Colin  to eschew the girls' nudity when he's never got a shirt covering up his  studly chest.\nThe only fun thing about this video is that Justin--that  pretentious, cigarette-smoking, pseudo intellectual creep--gets sent up  very effectively. The producers do have the last laugh on him. From his  phony double talk to his failure to flush before he flees, he'd no doubt be  mortified to see how he really comes across.\nThe video is organized  \"thematically,\" so there is a \"bloopers\" section (NOT  funny), a nudity section (censored), a bodily functions section (Teck and  Colin farting), and so on. There is no \"narrative\" to speak of,  none of the stories are forwarded the way they were episodically in the  regular season.\nWhat would have been MUCH more interesting, if the  producers wanted to really provide something that we couldn't get watching  on TV, would have been a video showing the cast members' reactions to  having their foibles broadcast on national television. None of what we  watch on TRW is in real time, it all happened 5 months ago. I would have  loved to see Amaya's embarrassment while witnessing her own ill-fated Colin  obsessing. I'd love to see Kaia realizing she's not going to get a modeling  contract. I'd love to see Matt cringe as he watches himself ministering to  Ruthie's every alcoholic whim.\nSoon, these people will (like Justin did  before them) be dropping off the national radar screen, never to be heard  from again. Rumor has it that Colin has been offered a TV pilot, and if the  cute factor alone can get him a \"showbiz\" career, more power to  him; one doubts it, though. He's old news.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Faye Dunaway is the title character Laura Mars.  Cutting edge fashion photographer of the avant garde, of questionable taste (her forte is sexualized violence), Laura suddenly experiences a vision one night: she wakes up unable to see what is in front of her ... instead she can see through the eyes of a murderer as he kills an associate.  Things quickly spiral out of control as the visions occur more frequently, and her friends are dispersed in the process.  In comes the police, unbelieving of her visions, but none the less forced to protect as it looks as though the killer is ultimately aiming for her.\n\nA taut, yet somehow not so unbelievable love story ensues between Laura and the cop who is to protect her played by a young Tommy Lee Jones (a man always to be involved in films where he is a position of legal authority: No Country for Old Men, The Fugitive, The Client ... you know the rest).

{"text": "The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.\n\nSorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.\n\nAnyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.\n\nIf you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'\n\nTo make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.\n\nThere are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.\n\nBut as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'", "label": 0}

Having been one of just 42 people in the  cinema when I saw the film, I was wondering just how bad it was going to  be. My fears were unfounded. It was entertaining, amusing and suitably  peculiar. I say suitably peculiar as, being a fan of the 60's TV series,  any deviation from the concept would have been totally unsatisfactory. The  movie, set in the sixties, was not a nostalgia trip (something which would  have been a distraction) but still managed to capture the essence of that  period. The plot was as silly as any in the TV series, thank goodness, and  the villain (Sean Connery) was appropriately unbelievable. It wasn't one of  Connery's best performances but he obviously enjoyed hamming it up  outrageously. You have to enjoy it for that alone. Don't fall into the trap  of comparing Uma Thurman and Ralph Feines with Diana Rigg and Patrick  Macnee. They play their parts differently, not better or worse, just  different. The comparison is irrelevant. The cinematography is excellent,  as are the special effects. Overall, a highly enjoyable film that should  appeal to fans of the genre, and Avengers fan specifically. Not a great  movie, but a good production. Its lack of success is unfortunate, and the  bad press overdone. It's likely to attain some degree of cult status within  a couple of years.", "label": 2}

Admittedly, it gets under your  skin, and Brad Davis was mightily effective in the role of Billy Hayes, and  John Hurt embodies creepily the stoned out prison mate Billy befriends  during his harrowing odyssey.  But this movie, directed with typical  stylish flair by visual master Alan Parker, never places the blame squarely  on Billy's shoulders, poor dumb guy.  And while his torturous stay in the  Turkish prisons practically smells, it is so dense and well-captured, it  did nothing for the image of Turkey, the country -- it is uncompromising  and brutally vicious in its depiction of virtually every Turkish location,  character and idea, for that matter.  If Turkey was such a pit of despair,  why did Billy decide to buy his hash there?  This movie revolves around a  character who is unrepentant and foolish, and while no one should have to  endure such human indignation, it is hard to escape that simple fact.  Parker's movie, taken on its own terms, has an almost poetic quality at  times, though Billy's dismissal of the Swede's advances actually made me  laugh out loud, and, by the way, was consummated in the book.

The film's central myth is the struggle of the individual human will against a Procrustean, deterministic society, which has been one of the most popular myths in Western literature for the past five thousand years.

This sometimes works and sometimes does not.  The idea that astronauts will wear business suits when strapped into acceleration couches strains credulity at best.  The acting is mostly competent but is directed to be so utterly flat in affect that one wonders why anybody in this future society would care about anything.  The exposition is constructed mostly of cliches and is predictable from beginning to end.  One of the cliches, a bone-clever gumshoe played wonderfully by Alan Arkin, provides a good contrast but seems entirely out of place--would such a society even permit people like this to occupy positions of authority?\nGattaca is a film that shows promise for a new director, but it doesn't quite make it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good \"Avengers\" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.\nRegarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.\nStick with the TV Show.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Based on the comic strip, \"Little Orphan Annie\" which later became a Broadway show that, of course, finally became a big budget movie, \"Annie\" is the 1981 musical from producer Ray Stark and director John Huston.  Odd, that neither had much experience with the musical genre until this film.  Some of their inexperience shows up on the screen.  The dance numbers are butchered in the editing and some good talent, though competent in their roles, are wasted nevertheless with a genuinely simple handling of the subject matter.  But what about the transfer - Columbia has made the film available in both full frame and the original widescreen format, enhanced here for 16X9 televisions.  For the purposes of film purists, this review will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are sometimes weak but nothing that leads to any great disappointment.  However, there are some framing issues, specifically during the \"Let's Go To The Movies\" musical number in which it appears as though someone has accidentally reframed a full screen version of this sequence, instead of using the 2:35:1 aspect ratio image.  Actor's heads are cut off and there is some interfield jittering as the camera pans to capture the action.  Otherwise, the rest of the film appears to have the proper widescreen image framed.  The ending of this movie is still its best part, with a gala party at the Warbuck's mansion yielding rich colors and bold blacks.  Fine grain, dirt, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative are visible but not distracting.  Some scenes are softly focused but again, these are brief. The stereo soundtrack 2.0 is ample but scratchy in spots and strident with a slight hiss in others. No great shakes overall but still worth the price for those who truly love this tuneful, though at times top heavy, musical motion picture.  As pure film, this version is still better than Disney's direct to video remake.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Not being an owner of a game console such as a Playstation and the like, I have never spent much time actually playing any of the Resident Evil series. I tried to play them on my PC, but it always seemed like my top of the line PC was being dumbed down by playing console games on it, like it was getting a headache trying to think on the same level as a console. That said, I have however seen the games played by many of friends and know the Resident Evil stories, read some of the comics and a couple of the novels. I know and like the characters and all of the playable ones like Claire Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both have one quality, among others, that Mila Jovovich lacks in abundance- her character Alice is not very likeable. In fact, she isn't much of anything, she isn't even that attractive.\n The Resident Evil movie also has very little in common with its console video game forebears- other than it's title and that it has an evil corporation named Umbrella which has made a terrible virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Now, to me, this sounds like a match made in heaven. I'm a graduate of the George A. Romero school of zombie flicks and cut my teeth on Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead. I make no apologies for like spectacular gore- I want to see people being ripped in half with their intestines and other organs spilling out on the floor with wet goopy splatting noises like a bowl of rotten fruits being tipped over. I want limbs hacked off. I want people using 500 bullets to kill something instead of using just one. I want Peter Jackson `Bad Taste' and `Brain Damage' level gore. Resident Evil the movie has flesh eating zombies, but very little gore, very little actual eating of flesh. Almost none. So, what's the point?\n Anyway, the film is pretty much an amalgamation of some of the game stories, namely the virus being released and Umbrella trying to cover it up by gassing the residents of a watch house after someone attempts to steal the virus and purposely releases it. Alice, who awakes in the shower, has no memories of her past and is suddenly thrust in the middle of a commando raid as Umbrella attempts to gain access to `The Hive'- their massive underground research facility where the `T'-virus was made and subsequently released. Now, in the video game, everything Umbrella owns is made of rusted steel and looks to be about a hundred years old or painted a sickly medicinal green and splattered with mud and blood. The film, however, everything is cut from polished stainless steel and aluminum, all very sanitary and high tech, which doesn't fit the milieu.\n The commandos realize they'll have take down a powerful hologram-based AI known as the Red Queen, because she controls the whole Hive and they suspect she's insane. Entering through a glass corridor we get to watch as most of the team is cut into meat by lasers, including the grid laser seen in the commercial. But they wimp out- we barely see Number 1 cut into giblets Sylvester-running-through-the-chain-link-fence style, and get a semi decent slow motion decapitation. Now, in my mind, after the first laser had passed and killed two of the commandos, the next obvious move would be to roll a couple of grenades down the hallway- made entirely out of glass!! Instead, no, everyone dies, leaving only Alice, three commandos and a ineffectual cop to deal with it all.\n All in all, this film is nothing like the video games. None of its characters are likeable and truth be told, I wanted them all to die. However, the production values are very high and they obviously put a lot of care and thought into the end product. I'm also a big fan of Jon Anderson- Event Horizon will always be one of my favorite films. But in Resident Evil he changed too much, took too much away from the games that made them so effective. Very few of the monsters made it to the screen save for the lickers, which were underused and the undead skinless dogs, again, underused. Notice I have said much about the zombies? I haven't because there aren't exactly a lot of them, nor a lot of scenes with them.\n It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I feel the movie does some good.  It doesn't deny that the main charector was wrong for what he did.  Remember, back in 1970, there was a more cavilier attitude towards drugs and he was dealing with the original 4 year prison sentence appropriately.  But being beaten, tortured and imprisoned in a foriegn country, with limited contact with family and freinds is going to be traumatic for anyone, and the movie dispays that well.\n\nWith that said, however, I think the movie deviates WAY too much from the book.  The escape first-handedly described in the book is much more fascinating and would have been better to see than the movies deviation.  The ommision of some the amnesties to prisoners makes the movie fall short as well.\n\nThe movie gets the basic point of the book across, but the impact could have been stronger if it just followed the story as laid out by the first hand recollection of it.", "label": 2}

Allow me to briefly introduce you to the actual content - the main reason why people buy Bible studies like Deeper Connections.\n\nUnlike IA's experience, my small group and I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from this Bible study.  The guide (or presenter) is actually over in Israel as he introduces each teaching, thus helping bring the text and teachings to life.

Moreover, his presentations were not cheesy, but informative and natural.\n\nIA may not like the lack of eye contact, but we personally thought it was insightful (plus, why give a 1/5 stars for something like that?).

{"text": "THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.

{"text": "In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the \"cutest\" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough \"cute\" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in \"Hitch\". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One \"Hillbillies-like\" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some \"crows\" out of a tree so that they won't \"**** all over the reception\". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.\n\nSad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.\n\nDolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.\n\nThe movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).\n\nOverall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Really now...  When I heard that they were putting my FAVORITE Christmas film on DVD, I was so excited.  A Muppet Family Christmas is something I watch every December.  It's funny, sweet, and so entertaining.  But, unfortunetly, the version on this DVD is not the version I just praised.  There are massive edits that are very noticable to viewers who have watched it since it first aired on TV and may leave first time viewers confused.  Fozzie's duet with the Snowman is cut out, the Muppet Babies home video is cut out (leaving Doc with a very strange line that doesn't make sense) and in my opinion the best part, where Miss Piggy enters, sings her song and slips on the Icy Patch, is edited out.  The best Icy patch gag and it's left out of the DVD/VHS.\n\nI am not going to buy this DVD.  Fortunately, my VHS tape still works well enough to watch it (yes with the OshGosh commercials and Double Mint Gum ones, too!).  Until they put the real complete version on the market, I will not spend my money on this DVD.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This movie is very powerful and is certainly deserving of its Top 100 AFI rating.  This is the story of madness and the slow decent into criminal violence that it leads Taxi Driver Bickle when he sees it as the only way out of a hopeless situation.  Loneliness can be a terrible thing to deal with and while most people struggle with it and choose a more conventional and healthy solution others with mental illness or who are prone to it \"choose\" different paths that may lead to self-destruction or as in the case of Travis Bickle, vigilante-ism and taking the law into his own hands to set things \"right.\"  The lonely angry psychopath who reacts in this way is the ticking time bomb that unfortunately is almost never recognised until the effects of their madness come to fruition e.g. the Unabomber etc.  DeNiro does an excellent job in portraying this individual and is genuinely scary in his role; even scarier is the realisation that perhaps at some point in our lives the vast majority of us have at least contemplated taking things into our own hands and so to some extent perhaps even identify and even find ourselves rooting for Travis.  The violent end may have shocked 70s audiences and you get the sense that Scorcese even toned it down a little for fear of a public backlash but it's interesting to me that as violence in film has been getting worse and worse over the years, I felt that it was pretty tame given what we are exposed to these days e.g \"Kill Bill\", \"Blade\" etc and I thought the final scenes were not violent enough relative to today's films.  Ironically, Bickle is treated as a hero and is not punished for his murders in the end which is also interesting as this ticking time bomb is released into the streets in an ominous ending which leaves us expecting a sequel of some sort.  I would like to see a Director's Cut of this movie and to see how Scorcese would \"modernise\" this brilliant film for today's audiences.  In my opinion, this is the best film since \"Midnight Cowboy\" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.\n\nThis dvd version of the film though is a bit of a mixed bag as although the picture and sound quality have been cleaned up the sound quality in 2 channels isn't very good and I'm glad that in the newer 2-Disc and upcoming Blu-ray versions you'll get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound option which I hope sounds much better than what we get here.  The picture quality isn't perfect as a few frames here and there have spots and other imperfections on them but I thought it was done well enough to not detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  The Special Features includes a good making-of documentary with interviews with Scorcese and the cast.\n\nOverall this is a great study into the lone, crazed anti-hero and is certainly one of the better films that I've ever seen.  You may however want to give this particular dvd version a miss and go instead for either the Blu-ray or the other 2-disc standard version with the improved sound quality.\n\nUpdated 1 July 2011: 4 stars.\n\nAmazon won't let me review this separately and so I'll do it here.  The blu-ray release of this wonderful Scorcese classic is a treat for fans as it certainly improves upon the dvd release that I reviewed above.  The digipak packaging with a number of colour postcards is very nice.  The all important picture and sound quality have also improved a great deal although the picture quality isn't perfect as there is still excessive grain in some parts especially in the scene in the brothel when DeNiro first speaks with Foster as well as in other spots but it is still an improvement over the dvd.  The sound quality is now in excellent surround mode and is the aspect most improved over the dvd version.\n\nNot perfect picture quality-wise but still worth the double-dip.\n\nRecommended!", "label": 2}

{"text": "This used to be one of my favorite movies but it no longer is. When I was younger I did not bother trying to comprehend the underlying message of this movie, nor any other movie for that matter. The message of this movie is now perfectly clear to me: convicts in Turkish prisons are frequently maltreated and tortured. Turkish prisons are inhumane and the entire justice system is flawed, corrupt and unjust. Moreover, the director of this movie implicitly implies that all Turks are barbarous, intransigent and uncivilized. This is corroborated by the fact that all Turkish characters in this movie are evil and their intentions are always malicious. Also an attempt is made to defame Islam and to show it as a religion which is inhumane, barbaric and merciless. On the other hand, Christians are depicted as humane and infallible. The principal point of this movie is that the Turkish society is flawed and atavistic as its justice system shows no mercy towards drug smugglers, rapists and murderers. Many of these assertions may be true but it would be a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification to claim that all of this is true and that these injustices are unique for Turkey. The director of this movie should have done some research at home before he set out to criticize an entire nation. Consider some of these facts: U.S.A. still has capital punishment; it has been demonstrated in many cases that the application of the death penalty is racially discriminatory (much more blacks are sentenced to death than whites); in many states, minors and mentally retarded are sentenced to death even though this violates the U.S. constitution; the U.S. government incarcarates people without letting them know what they have been charged with and denies them adequate legal representation etc. (Guantanamo Bay in Cuba). If these facts are not indicative of a flawed and unjust justice system, then what is? In my view, it is extremely hypocritical and cynical not to judge our own actions and transgressions by the same standards we apply to others. This is a good movie but it would have been much better had it not been so severely biased and prejudiced.", "label": 0}

{"text": "First off, I have to admit to having seen the Japanese version of this film, \"Ju-On,\" and comparatively speaking, this Americanized version is similar in many ways but there was definitely something lost in the translation.  I own \"Ju-On\" because, quite honestly, I haven't seen a movie that creepy in a long time.  While the Japanese version has its flaws and low-budget look, the story is broken up into four parts and therefore the film is much easier to follow.  I know for a fact if I hadn't already seen \"Ju-On\" the \"The Grudge\" would have been more than a little confusing with its non-linear plotting and scenes from the first version that are inexplicably left out of \"The Grudge.\".  \"The Grudge\" is less effective than \"Ju-On\" for the simple reason that is has a little too much Hollywood in it.  The ending in \"The Grudge\" is Hollywood Horror slop, while the ending in \"Ju-On\" is more ominous and eerie, as if to say \"this evil cannot be stopped no matter what you do or where you hide.\"  However, there were some moments in \"The Grudge\" that were chilling and creepy, regardless.  Remember, I've already seen this story twice going in and I just wanted a comparison between the two films.  I still got chills watching \"The Grudge.\"  Most of the great sound-effects from the first film are used again here, but there was an over-use of the score which frequently ruined some otherwise scary scenes reducing them to shock-tactics.  For instance, in \"Ju-On\" a young woman enters a quiet room with no music playing in the film when a cat screeches suddenly.  In my head, I was in the room with that character at that moment and I got a thrill without the score giving me notice beforehand.  In \"The Grudge\" the music is used too often at the wrong times to \"enhance\" a scary moment before it even happens and the illusion is weakened.  Another thing about this version that makes little sense is that there certainly seem to be a lot of Americans entering and/or contacting this residence in Tokyo, Japan.  I saw more caucasian characters in this film set in Japan than I saw Japanese characters.  It was certainly admirable of Executive Producer Sam Raimi to try and bring \"Ju-On\" to the American masses; and while \"The Grudge\" does succeed now and again at invoking terror, it does not live up to the original film overall.  In the end, the trappings of Hollywood Horror that are connected to this version make it less interesting to watch than its Japanese counterpart.", "label": 2}

While this might sum up to an additional 10-15 minutes, the differences are hardly noticeable while watching the film (for example, the \"Hellboy\" director's cut was almost exactly the same film).\n\nIf you already bought this film and really like it, it might be worth renting this director's cut to see if you think it's really worth it.

I found it quite unbelievable that  she is so willing to accomodate all the hardships.  The movie didn't really  show that the relationship between her and her new hubby is too great to  break (there is not much emotions between the couple except a few kiss  scenes) so where is all her feelings attached to the kids coming from? To  me she is just trying too hard that she only proves she is a very insecure  woman regardless of her successful career.  Near the end of the movie Julia  finally confess to the biological mom that she is worried that one day Anna  will grow up only wondering where her real mom is in her wedding, I found  this scene incredibly unpersuasive.  How old is Julia Roberts supposed to  be in this film didn't she think that one day she will bear child of her  own?

I do like action movies like Die Hard, Braveheart, and Under Siege, but for some reason I find some of the violence disturbing and a bit gratuitous and that is not entertaining. Maybe Gary Oldman plays his character too well! There are too many scenes of summary executions and the unfairness of which leave me feeling a bit angry. The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.\n\nDespite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.", "label": 2}

The seasons 5 and 6 are being released separately. Buy them instead of duplicating your seasons 1-4 with this complete series offering. Of course, if you don't have any seasons, then buy this complete series.", "label": 2}

{"text": "An A-list cast and sleek Hollywood production values can't overcome the fact this film adaptation sucks a good deal of the life and feeling out of the play on which it is based.  Attempts to \"open up\" the story by leaving the beauty parlor set which was the location of the play and adding male characters only dilute the material.  The most egregious mistake is showing the death of one of the characters, rather than allowing us to experience it though the originally powerful final monologue of another character.  This makes that monologue (significantly cut) anticlimactic.  A tacked-on feel good \"the cycle of life continues\" coda  only makes the petering out of energy more pronounced.  Performances range from good (Sally Field) to phoned in (Olympia Dukakis) to perfectly dreadful (Shirley McLaine).  A good example of how \"the industry\" can botch good material.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Two years have passed since Julie James was tortured by her fish-hook wielding nemesis, a victim of her friends' hit and run.  However, the body was never found.  Still living in fear, and in college, Julie is delighted when she and her friends win a holiday to the Bahamas in a radio competition.\nAlthough I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is meant to be a revenge sequel- it seems to focus more on advertising on a holiday in the Bahamas.  By the end of the film, we are sick and tired of Julie's moaning and just want to see her get slashed and gashed!  Yet again, the film ends with sequel potential.\nQuestion is- can we handle another Summer sequel?  Or is the series tired enough as it is?\nI Still Know What You Did... still manages to get away with the usual horror sequel criticisms.

Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesman\n\nThe movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.\n\nHis rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.\nThe sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive", "label": 1}

{"text": "I can't help but wonder how good this film may have been had it had another director, maybe one more attentive to the nature of the story.  Instead, actress/singer/director Barbara Streisand helms this picture, and she does a lot more damage than good.  Instead of creating a film that is rooted in raw emotion and heartbreaking tragedy she turns this film into a longwinded soap opera with over-the-top acting and `romance novel' style dialog.  In fact, the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that I seriously wanted to vomit amidst all the saccharine facileness.\n\nThe film tells the story of Tom Wingo, a southern `good ol' boy' who is troubled by a dark family secret, a secret that has pushed his sister to attempt suicide.  While she lies in a hospital room, Tom ventures to New York and meets his sister's psychiatrist Susan.  Tom is apposed to his sister seeing a shrink, but the more he sees Susan the more he begins to open up, about his life, his wife, his mother and eventually uncovering the family secret that has haunted him for so many years.\n\nThe idea behind the film is a good one in my opinion (I have not read the book, although I don't hear good things about it so I don't think I will) but the handling of the material really sidelines the film in my opinion.  Instead of taking a raw and emotional approach to the film, the soap operaish delivery makes light of the tragedy surrounding the film and ultimately turns the serious subject of abuse, suicide and murder into a joke.  All of this weighty material is more or less just a backdrop for Tom and Susan to fall in love and in the end the film makes their relationship the weightiest subject; expecting the audience to swell up with tears at the prospect of them having to leave one another as apposed to the audience being emotionally responsive to the turmoil boiling within Tom's past.\n\nThe acting doesn't really help the matter.\n\nI am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I never have been and never will be.  He has really only delivered a few (countable on one hand) good performances, and this is not one of them.  His over-the-top delivery of Tom's emotions is comical to say the least.  He has one good scene, when he finally breaks down and exposes his past.  It's the only scene where his emotions seem real, and it's the only respectable `scene' in the film (which ends up getting ruined by the overly sentimental `cry in my bosom' closing).  Streisand is better than Nolte, but too clichd.  The only good acting comes from the supporting cast, notably Blythe Danner (who is sorely underused) and Kate Nelligan (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance).  They are not enough to save the film, but they at least prove to add some interest to their scenes.\n\nIn the end I can honestly say that `The Prince of Tides' is a missed opportunity, which I think is what makes the sting of the films failure hurt all the more.  It could have been so deep and haunting but instead comes off vapid and hollow.", "label": 0}

I originally bought this movie in order to select a 30 minute clip of this relevant Christmastime topic to show to my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nThe foul language made it undesirable from the beginning. But worse, was that the writer, director or actor must not have bothered researching the person of George Washington. He would not have taken the name of the Lord in vain and did not even allow his men to swear. He was known to have impeccable manners, yet this movie has him loudly belittling General Henry Knox, in front the troops, for being overweight! This was supposed to be the funny part of the movie, I suppose; making fun of a great American hero who, one year earlier, was responsible for the British evacuation of Boston after having captured 59 canon and mortars from Fort Ticonderoga and bringing them 300 miles in the worst of weather to General Washington.\n\nJeff Daniels played Washington with no personality whatsoever. He was expressionless throughout the movie! Impatient, rude, snide - yes. But void of positive character traits. Washington was made to look like an imbalanced, foolish man. In real life, no one would have put such a person in a position of  leadership or would have followed him.

And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.\nAn adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.", "label": 0}

The first 20-30 minutes  of the film are an amusing reminder of the charm of the old TV series, but  things fall apart quickly after that.  The perils introduced by the  antagonist, Sean Connery, are unbelievable in the extreme.  No amount of  surreal interpretation can convince the viewer that they are anything but  ridiculous.  The gross incompetence of many characters is evident as both  good and evil fail repeatedly to accomplish even the simplest of tasks to  which they set themselves.  Even if one is able to get past the silly  devices and look only at the story, the narrative is mundane and  predictable.

{"text": "I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.\n\nOther than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.\n\nThis movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your \"must\" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable \"fortress\", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.\n\nThe zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.\n\nOn the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.\n\nNext time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.\n\nAmanda Richards, February 22, 2005", "label": 2}

{"text": "Like many other reviewers, I first saw this as a kid on television in '79 and Henry Winkler's \"Fonzie\" persona was still so much a part of the cultural fabric that it was somewhat shocking to even think of him, much less see him, as anything else.\nHowever, I was transfixed by this adaptation on the Dickens story and was genuinely moved by Winkler's ( Benedict Slade ) transformation at the end. Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the \"Cratchit\" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too \"soft\".\nThe actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.\nThe movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.\nMy only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (\"Scrooge\") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out. This is noticeable particularly against the distinctive New England accents employed throughout the rest of the picture.\nI recommend this DVD highly for anyone who loves the Christmas season, the Dickens novel in particular, Henry Winkler, or just any good heartwarming story. I looked for this on DVD and/or VHS for almost twenty years. It was worth the wait.", "label": 1}

Jeanne/Joan acts equally unconvincingly and affectedly, as if starring in a high-school production of \"Girl, Interrupted.\"\nHer take-your-meds, sputtering announcements do not portray her as a vessel of the devine as much as a\na kid trying to get out of doing a book report.

Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary.

Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theatre, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick).

First of all, it was not even historically accurate--there were more glaring innaccuracies and downright fabrications spewed forth in this movie than in a televised political debate. Joan of Arc was basically portrayed as a delusional, over-intense, angry girl who threw tantrums when things didn't go her way.\nJoan of Arc's heroic accomplishments are overshadowed in this movie. Her actions which helped free the France from English control are cast in a cynical light--that she was mostly motivated by a desire for revenge. There is no mention of what a good, loving, unselfish person she was--during her trials her friends and those who knew her testified how that she was all of these things.\nIf you are looking for a sensational piece of fluff that reveals nothing about St. Joan of Arc, then watch this movie. If you want to find out more about the real St. Joan of Arc's life and accomplishments, look elsewhere.

{"text": "I must admit I was rather disappointed by The Grudge. I've watched a lot of horror movies, and The Grudge just didn't strike me as very scary at all - it's creepy enough on occasion to make some viewers jump, but I didn't find anything actually scary about any of it - unless you think Japanese women and little boys wearing black mascara in Tammy Faye proportions is scary. It would have helped if more of the \"scary\" moments hadn't been preceded by an obvious, ridiculously loud crescendo of the music. I wasn't all that impressed with the story, either - it hangs together just fine, but it didn't seem to have much substance. I wouldn't even begin to compare this film with The Ring, which was much, much scarier and emotionally powerful. I have a lot of respect for Japanese horror films, so I'm not blaming any type of cultural differences between Japanese audiences and myself for my dissatisfaction. To me, this film just wasn't nearly as different or original as the filmmakers assert in all of the making-of featurettes. Just because The Grudge serves up a non-linear presentation of the plot and doesn't employ gore to impart its most visceral effects doesn't mean the film is automatically excellent (in the same way that a gory film is not automatically bad just because of the gore). It all comes down to the story, and this just isn't that great of a story.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar (who has, by the way, looked better than she does here) stars as a sort-of nurse who has moved to Tokyo with her boyfriend (who, unfortunately, seems to have graduated from the Ashton Kutcher school of fashion). She helps care for infirm patients, and she has to fill in at a certain house one day - while there, she displays an unhealthy curiosity for a series of strange noises, which leads her to a creepy little boy and his fierce cat; before the day is through, she sees something much more frightening than that. Well, it turns out that this particular house was the scene of a violent crime, and the emotional angst that accompanied that terrible event remains in the house, marking for death everyone who dares cross over the threshold. We're soon off on the first of several flashbacks. By the midpoint of the film, it's obvious what is going on here, but that doesn't stop the onslaught of flashbacks. The ending is a little different than what you might expect - but I found it rather unsatisfying (although it does furnish some of the film's creepier - but still not scary - moments).\n\nI just think this movie needed something more, especially at the end; the whole thing felt more like a number of related scenes thrown together than a full-fledged movie. Part of my frustration probably stems from the fact that Gellar's character is absent from a good chunk of the first hour of the film. Gellar seemed really excited about this film in her interviews, but that wonderful Gellar magic seemed bottled up in every one of her scenes. Her whole character never seemed to develop fully - actually, that's a problem with the movie as a whole. I really didn't care about any of these characters, be they innocent or guilty. And I really don't think there is anything complex about the plot - the filmmakers tried to make it seem complicated by the nonlinear storyline, but the final big flashback at the end was almost boring because it wasn't showing me anything I hadn't already figured out. I'm not buying the argument that The Grudge is comparatively deeper or more intellectual than many a good western horror film, either - a film like The Others beats The Grudge hands down, in my opinion.\n\nThe movie does come with some 45 minutes of interviews and behind-the-scenes materials, as well as a 12-minute lecture on the psychological nature of fear. There was a little bit of overkill with all this. I got the impression I was expected to love this film just because it was rooted in Japanese culture, made by the Japanese director and film crew of Ju-on, and different than typical Hollywood horror movies. I'm sorry, but as much as I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, The Grudge just didn't impress me all that much.\n\nWho are these people who simply assume that Japanese films in their original Japanese formats won't fly in America? I'm sure Ju-on is a much better film that this Americanized remake - how about slapping some subtitles on the originals and giving American audiences a chance to prove whether or not films like Ringu and Ju-on can fill the seats of American movie houses?", "label": 2}

{"text": "While the Resident Evil movie adaptation of the game didn't hold any Acadamy Award winning performances or groundbreaking special effects, it was a great popcorn movie.  It was truly scary in some parts and had practically non-stop action throughout.  During the action scenes, all I could keep saying was, \"I wish I had a game controller and could play this!\"  That, and how cool it was.\n  The movie's musical score, composed by none other than Marilyn Manson, was really well done, adding a definite techno-horror feel to the film.  One track, called \"Seizure of Power\", is a really driving piece of music which makes you lean forward in your seet while watching the movie, ready for whatever might come next.\n  The story line is rather original, actually.  Anyone who was expecting it to be just like the first game was in for a major shock:  it wasn't.  The story follows a new line of characters, mostly an Umbrella Special Forces team, sent to the Raccoon City Secret Umbrella Lab (called the Hive) to shut down a haywire computer system that killed all the scientists in the lab after a T-Virus leak.  It sounds kinda cheesy, but, believe me, the first time the Red Queen (computer system) warns the team to leave, chills will run all over you!\n  All in all, Resident Evil is a really fun action-horror film for both fans of the game and horror-movie buffs.  It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night with some popcorn and a thunder storm outside!", "label": 2}
{"text": "John Ankerberg and Jimmy DeYoung come together to create \"Israel Under Fire: The Prophetic Chain of Events That Threatens the Middle East,\" a book that promises to explain the Biblical predictions concerning the current events in Israel, how what happens in Israel affects the rest of the world, and answers the age old question, \"Will there ever be peace in the Middle East.\" To come to these answers Ankerberg and DeYoung interview - on location in Israel and the Middle East - many of the policy makers and experts who would be close to the situation, such as, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel and Reuven Rivlin, the Speaker of the Knesset in Israel.\n\nAnkerberg and DeYoung are less authors than interviewers for much of the book (and interviewees, as I will explain.) The authors claim that the book will answer questions and give a biblical basis for the current events in Israel. To accomplish these goals the authors provide a brief history how the modern state of Israel came to be, what exactly is currently happening in Israel. On these points, I found that the authors were successful. Unfortunately, this was only the one part of the book.\n\nIn the second part of the book, the authors interview current world leaders and here is where I feel the books goes awry. I had two issues here. First, the authors advertise on the back cover that they interview Adnan Husseini, Yasser Arafat's cousin and Palestinian Authority spokesman.' It is true. But this is a little misleading as he is one of three world leaders advertised yet he appears in only one very short section with only a couple of questions, while the others leaders, Jewish pundits exclusively, are interviewed extensively. This is far from balanced coverage.\n\nSecond, the authors didn't just interview pundits they agreed with - they also interviewed each other. I understand that the authors may be experts in a field but their opinions should be bolstered by other expert's opinions, statistics, reports and the like. Author's opinions should not be proved by their own opinions. The issue of lack of documentation and proof isn't just relegated to their opinions in interviews. Unfortunately, the authors take comments and opinions from pundits they agree with for granted, moving right past controversial quotes that cry out for data that reinforces the opinion. The only reference in the book to an outside source (other than the Bible) is on page 156 (of 174).\n\nIn the third section of the book, the authors attempt to tie current events with Biblical prophecy. I would expect that anyone, after reading this book, even someone who has no experience with Biblical prophecy or current events, would be able to walk away understanding the \"prophetic chain of events that threaten the Middle East.\" What I found in this section, though, was confusion. To explain a complicated book like Revelation, I would expect we would start at the beginning and work our way through the (purported) time line from start to finish. I would expect that current events would be tied in to the timeline to show how the events fit into the puzzle. I would expect that the authors would show how these events work together to fulfill prophecy. Unfortunately, Ankerberg and DeYoung did not make a convincing connection for me.\n\nWhile I did find the first section of the book interesting, this book left me unsatisfied in my search for connections between current events and Biblical prophecy. Revelation itself is already difficult to understand and I found the authors didn't accomplish their goal of making it accessible and understood by the novice.\n\nAs much as I would have liked to, I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the expert Bible prophecy student.\n\nThis book was provided free of charge by the publisher as a review copy. The publisher had no editorial rights or claims over the content or the conclusions made in this review. Visit Harvest House's website for more information on this book.", "label": 0}

Endless motocycle panoramas\n\nset to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene\n\nwhere our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and\n\nmock the idea of religion.\n\nThe film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.

{"text": "The Grudge is a horror film remake of a Japanese film. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:\n\nIs it scary?\n\nMaybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word \"scary.\"\n\nThe Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.\n\nYou see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.\n\nReal horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.\n\nBasically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those \"jump out at you\" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.\n\nThree stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.", "label": 2}

I usually try to be a bit more intelligent, but the first word that comes to mind when I think of this particular version is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.  The ONLY two bits of this film I appreciated were the attention given to her ring (given her by her brother), as well as the scene when she brings a child back to life (I am unaware of any other films on her that portray this true story).

{"text": "I love the Resident Evil video games. I have been a fan since the first one was released in 1996. I love the storyline, the erie soundtrack, the creepy sound effects and of course, blowing the heads off of the walking dead. When I heard they were making a film based on it with George Romero directing, I went unconscious. I was so excited and couldn't wait to see it. Then, Mr. Romero was dropped from the project and it was given to the biggest hack in Hollywood history...Paul W.S. Anderson. Besides the competent Mortal Kombat, he has yet to make a film worthy of a one week run at a dollar house. This movie was shameful from beginning to end. Complete with faux-Matrix action, cookie-cutter acting, void of any horror or suspence and featuring CG that must have been made on a Tandy PC from 1988. He even trashed the storyline. There was no Red Queen nonsense in any of the games, and certainly no child hologram telling everyone they are going to die. And don't give me the excuse of it being campy on purpose. This movie failed on every possible level, including being one of those bad movies that never takes itself seriously and becoming a midnite cable classic. Anyone who likes this movie needs to see a George Romero film immediately. He is the one who started the whole zombie genre and it still the best at it. Once you see any of those films, you'll forgot about this one and realize how much better this could have been. Mr. Anderson is also helming the Alien Vs. Predator movie, due out Summer 2004. This movie has been in the works as long as the recent Freddy Vs Jason film. You'd be better off playing the 16 bit Sega game than being subjected to his desecration of it as a film.

{"text": "Torn. Yes, this is how I was left feeling when the move came to a close. Let me explain:\n  I was filled with much anticipation & excitement hearing of\nthis action-packed/sci-fi starring two female roles: Milla Jovovich & my new found favorite, Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight). I have followed Milla's early modeling career back when she graced the covers of Nov & Dec '89 issues of Seventeen Mag up until her movie career. She has played a variety of charectors far from her 'model persona'. But to put her in a flimsy red dress & black leather boots to fight off something capable of destroying mankind? It strays away from her role as Alice, a strong member of a covert security team which she specializes in\nhand-to-hand combat, not to mention martial arts skills assured to leave any 'livingdead' DEAD. I'm sure they thought a slight peep of her thighs would keep our attention. What they don't realise it's those rediculous decisions that make a film flop. Milla took what she was given & did the best she could: to [beat down]& look cute.\n  Then there's Michelle Rodriguez. She rightfully is dressed the part of a commando. 1st class to be exact. No frills and she does not need any. She has a certain mystique and charisma that no lipstick or fancy wardrobe could come close to.\n  Although I believe the script was poorly written and we, the audience, were not fully introduced to the charectors as individuals, I truly feel the actors put all they could in this film.\n  Oh yeah, it scared the hell outta me, and the soundtrack was great. The fight scenes left me at the edge of my seat.\nMaybe someday we can have it all in an action or sci-fi: great writing, well rounded plot, interesting charectors, & most of all, leading ladies getting the job done and takin' names later.", "label": 2}

The special effects are good, the acting isn't bad, the dialogue isn't stupid, the story is good, and there is a fair amount of scares.  All in all, the movie is a little generic and unoriginal but nothing is done badly.\n\nThe story is that a secret research facility known as The Hive resides below the city of Raccoon City and someone has unleashed the deadly T-virus within the facility.  This virus amongst other things has the ability to bring the dead back as zombies, flesh eating killers which have the ability to transmit the deadly virus by biting.  A highly trained group of \"special forces\" type guys are sent into The Hive by the Umbrella Corporation to figure out what happen.  Nobody outside knows why facility shut itself down.  The facility is still being controlled by the master AI, which needless to say is a little bit paranoid of the current situation.\n\nIn conclusion, I didn't regret watching this movie and have even enjoyed rewatching it several times.

{"text": "This 2004 horror/action sequel from Sony is among the first titles to be ported to the PSP UMD video format.  Starring the lovely Milla Jovovich, RE:A is loosely based on the video game series from Capcom.\n\nThe Movie <spoiler alert!>\n\nLet's just be honest here: when you're dealing with a movie based on a B-genre video game title you are asking for trouble.  The fact that said movie is a sequel further exacerbates the problem.  Now, the first RE movie was actually a  moderate success.  Beautiful Milla was a likeable heroine and the plot was servicable, if full of blatant rip-offs from a host of better sci-fi/horror flicks.  Still, the movie was well-paced, and had a killer opening sequence.  There was a fair balance of action, horror, and science fiction throughout.\n\nRE:Apocolypse, by contrast, is a more straight forward action film that suffers as a result of it's own failed expectations.  The story basically centers around how the shadowy, uber-corporation, Umbrella, ends up pitting their two greatest genetic warriors, Alice and Nemesis (her now mutated beyond recognition old partner/lover), against each other.  The whole middle of the movie is simply filler to allow a couple of characters from the game series (Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, played by Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr respectively) to make an appearance and provide a plot device to segue to a possible third sequel.\n\nGranted you can't expect too much from a movie like this, but my biggest gripe by far is the very lame guy-in-a-rubber suit fight at the end.  Director Alexander Witt tries his best to hide this really really really bad attempt at a \"Big Boss Battle\" between Alice and Nemesis with very close-up, choppy camera work, and quick-cut edits, but it's pretty obvious that they needed a budget for digital effects that they did not end up getting.\n\nOverall, this movie is at least half-way entertaining, especially if you're a fan of Milla as she is quite the ass-kicker.  Jovovich is quoted as being a fan of the game, and it's to her credit that she takes this role seriously enough to lend it some credibility despite the tacky premise and uninspired, contrived scripting.\n\nThe Video\n\nPretty close to what you would find on DVD.  There is some bleeding/saturation of dark scenes that you would expect from the LCD screen, but overall it's nothing that only a real videophile would get riled over.\n\nThe Sound\n\nDialog is soft, but the general sound field and effects are well done.  For example, helicopter rotors moving across the screen have the appropriate effect on the headphones.  Nice.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nThere are none.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite it's many flaws, RE:A is really the kind of movie the PSP is going to be concentrating on for now: relatively short, action-oriented films with cheap thrills.  Taken for what it is, it is more of a \"guilty pleasure\" than anything else.\n\nI can't really recommend it, but being a Milla softie I enjoyed it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series.  Simple as that.  Why?  Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick, and a rather average one at that.\n\nThey bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.\n\nI'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight.  Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger.  Meh, Jill deserves better in my opinion.  Also, it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense, it's just that it's hard to believe (without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end.  Not a good storyline direction for a movie.\n\nThere's nothing remotely scary about this movie.  Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans, that's for sure.  All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead.

Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.\n\nTo the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me).

But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.\n\nThe story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.\n\nI was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do.

Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.\n\nThere's a whole host of famous British faces in this.

Now, I know a good comedy when I see one, and honestly I don't think I laughed at all. When a comedy runs pretty much only on dialouge I understand it can be hard to keep people interested. With all the horrible comedys out there, there really isn't many to enjoy. Look at the Big Lebowski, the funniest movie ever made, in my opinion. I am looking foward to seeing The Royal Tennanbaums this winter, and hopefully Wes Anderson keeps getting better. Overall I think Bottle Roccket was not very funny, but I will give credit to Luke & Owen Wilson for their performances.\nAnd also Esquire Magazine did a poll to vote which Director would be the next Martin Scorsese - Wes Anderson, last I checked was winning, and also got a vote from Scorsese himself, but I think anyone who knows any better knows who the greatest director is right now and he shares the same last name as Wes - PTA.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Ok, I'll admit. I am a rabid fan of the resident evil series. I was  thrilled when the first movie came out, and was decently entertained by the first film. So, of course when I heard there was to be a sequel based on RE3, I was equally thrilled.\n\nErr....then I watched it.\n\nFirst off, there is way too much Milla. Granted, she was a good character for the first movie, because that movie was based on nothing in the games, and thus was believable to a point. But now, she's gone all Wesker on us, and is the superwoman of the movie. Please, please Mr. Anderson...stop giving the fanboys shots of Milla's miniscule chest, and give us the actual *game* characters in lead roles.\n\nI did enjoy some parts. Nemesis was well put together, and rather authentic to the games. Probably the most authentic character of the movie, yet we don't see enough of him. D'oh. Carlos is, well, Carlos. Jill is not nearly the repectable S.T.A.R.S ass-kicker we all know and love, unfortunately. Nickolai is good now, and actually played well. (yay for Zach Ward!) Then there's alot of random plot-filling characters that are there as nothing more than zombie-fodder. That too...not enough zombie action. Sure, we see hordes of them in many shots of the city. But that's all there is, walking hordes. Not alot of the random jump-outs that are classic to the games. And, don't get me started on the Ashfords.\n\nSo, all-in-all, this was a good idea gone down the crapper. Some parts were decently done, but the majority was pasted together too sloppy. I guess Paul Anderson was too busy screwing with AvP to give this movie it's due credit.", "label": 2}

I was watching the DVD and thought about stopping it but instead just let it play while I went about other business.\n\nThis movie has no point to it.  it is weird oddball humor for no other reason or purpose other than weird oddball humor.  And I use the term \"humor\" very loosely.\n\nIt's obviously not supposed to be a real-life story; it's too strange.  It can't be a satire; there's no parallel to anything in real life.  It's not much of a comedy; the story is weird without being funny.  So what is it?  Nothing.  It's just a bunch of strange characters doing strange things for strange reasons, that has no emotional heft.  You don't care about the characters because they are all caricatures.  You don't feel any emotion because the plot is just absurd.  You don't laugh at any \"jokes\" because they aren't jokes, they're just people acting oddly.  There is nothing to enjoy in this movie.  It seems to be an exercise in deliberately being as weird as possible just for the sake of being weird.  But I see no purpose or artistic point to it.  Maybe we're supposed to be challenged in our assumptions of narrative, coherent story, interesting characters?  For what?  The whole thing is pointless and a waste of time.\n\nI felt the same way about The Royal Tenenbaums.  But I want to be fair and say I did like Rushmore, which was odd but had more of a believable plot and characters.

{"text": "This film is a complete waste of time.  There is absolutely no plot, which results in nothing more than watching uninteresting characters get wasted at concerts.  The movie's message is completely unoriginal.  How many films have we all seen where rebellious kids grow up and find out that they can no longer identify with a youth culture?  Nothing new.  The characters are bland and one-dimensional, preventing any interest in their \"struggle\".  Although I am not a punk, if the entire culture consists of wearing ugly clothes and trying to get by without working, then I think I'm better off for it.  This culture and movement should consist of intellectuals concerned with figuring out how to create change in the issues that concern them and developing organization within the culture in order for all involved to survive without having to join the system.  The characters in this movie are not punk.  They are bored, rich, spoiled kids who need attention and have nothing better to do than \"rebel\".  Its no wonder that the main character ends up selling out because he got scared by the image of seeing one his friends end up homeless, begging for change.  He didn't realize that the movement was unrealistic, he simply realized that he was a poser all along.  Usually I find good aspects even in bad movies.  Unfortunately, this movie had none.  Unless you're a bored youth who is a punk because you wanted to be \"different\", steer clear of this waste of time.", "label": 0}

But does she inspire legions of men to defend her and to defend France? Does she convey the kind of passion and compassion that could inspire so many men to believe in her? I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the \"insanity\" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure? In this portrayal though Jovovich overacts and instead of conveying the passion of someone for whom her religion is sacred she conveys insanity.

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Love the movie.  One of my favorites.  Love the transfer to blu-ray.  Crystal clear for the most part (a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry, and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out).  The extras are limited but interesting, and informative, with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam's commentary on the lost animation sequences.  (He really didn't sound very happy to be doing them.)\n\nHowever, the \"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\" feature on this disc (which is adminstered by Sony) is entirely worthless.  You may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod, iPad, or other device at your leisure, right?  WRONG.  The downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer ONLY.  And in order to get that, you must create an account with Sony, give them your personal information, and install their proprietary software (Silverlight) to download and view the copy.  After giving them my name, email and other information (and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address, which YOU MUST DO to proceed with the account creation - there is no way to opt out and still continue), jumping through all the installation hoops and installing Silverlight, it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high-speed DSL to download this +/- 90 munite epic.  Amazing speed and efficiency, no?  Incidentally, the download also overheated and burned out my old DSL modem.\n\nAfter all that, I tried to transfer the downloaded movie to iTunes.  Guess what?  You can't.  If you want to download it to a mobile device, you have to install additional software, go through the Ultraviolet site again, and essentially repeat the download process on that device.  God only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an A5 chip...  Then, you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device, right?  Not according to the folks who have tried it!  If you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house, you're out of luck!  You see, if you get outside the range of your WiFi connection, the movie will not be viewable.  Apparently the digital copy needs to contact Sony every time you try to view it.  Just a little quirk that Sony forgot to mention to you!  Want to take a copy of the movie on vacation?  Too bad!  Long car or plane ride?  Too bad!  Maybe someone should call Sony and inform them of the meaning of the word \"mobile\" so they stop advertising their \"digital copy\" for your \"mobile device\".\n\nSo, buy this blu-ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the \"digital copy\" (sorry I keep putting it in quotes, but I feel like, if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices, in what sense do you have an actual \"copy\" of anything?) go ahead and buy it.  Frankly, I can't recommend the movie enough.  Just don't expect to be able to use the \"digital copy\" that comes with it.\n\nPS:  There are a number of movies (like James Cameron's new release of \"Titanic\" on blu-ray) that come with actual, bona fide digital copies. You plug a download code into iTunes, and it downloads automatically.  And you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to.  Just look for the little \"iTunes\" logo on the cover.  And stay away from anything marked with \"Ultraviolet\".  Ultraviolet is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, not worth the time.  In short, UV copies are worthless.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.\nResident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called \"The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.\nWe then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.\nAs directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.\nActually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.\nThere are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.\nThe zombies in this movie are your basic \"pale and rotting skin\" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.\nMost of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.\nBecause there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.\nCompared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.\n** 1/2 out of *****", "label": 0}
{"text": "\"Easy Rider\" is the 60s counter-culture classic that seems to wreak slightly of formaldehyde today. It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic \"Born to Be Wild,\" \"Easy Rider\" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.\n\nPreviously, \"Easy Rider\" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.", "label": 2}
{"text": "..and is defeated.\nThe main problem appears to stem from the lack of realism, it is simply not sufficiently believable for a historical epic.\nJovovich is not remotely convincing as a leader of men, showing  neither charisma nor divinity. She's just plain mental.\nJohn Malkovich  is totally miscast as the young King, and quite why Dustin Hoffman's part  exists at all is a mystery.\nThe battle scenes are visually impressive  but  show us only the spectacular gore, and none undoubted horror and fear  of the battlefield. Five invincible nobles cutting a bloody swathe through  dozens of doomed English Knights and foot soldiers would be more at home in  a Conan film than a historical epic.\nAnd the accents? Although nowhere  near the farce that The Man In the Iron Mask was, the mixture just doesn't  work. English and Americans playing Frenchmen share dialogue with Frenchmen  playing Frenchmen and we end up with a compromised mess. The only way to  tell identify who's supposed to  be English is that they have as yet  undiscovered Northern English dialects and swear.\nOn the positive side,  Faye Dunaway is good, as are all the French cast.\nI can't help thinking  that had this been made in French with a French cast, a more subtle Joan  and more realism in battle, it could have been a great film.\nBut it  wasn't, and it isn't.", "label": 0}

I noticed how the wall moved (quite a bit); it looked to be made out of cardboard!\n\nThe 25 year Anniversary Special is very well done and very interesting.\n\nNow for the review:\n\nI would assume that some reading this have the series on VHS and want to upgrade to DVD.  My advice is: DON'T.  These DVDs were not remastered at all; I don't care what the description says.  The DVD set is no better than the VHS. The beginning intro (the music and cartoons from Punch magazine) is cut off in several episodes. There are numerous episodes where the tape (thus the DVD) jumped and the picture is momentarily distorted.  Images are fuzzy and the colors are off.\n\nMy last advice is if you can wait, wait a couple of years when it is the 40th anniversary of the series.  No doubt remastered digital DVDs will be produced at that time as most films are on anniversaries.\n\nPBS will offer a few NEW episodes of \"UpDown\" in April 2011; Jean Marsh reprises the role of Rose Buck working for the new family at Eaton Place. I have heard rumors that new episodes are already being filmed, so popular was the new series.\n\n[...]", "label": 0}

The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research. It would have done them wonders to log on to any number of newsgroups to get a feel for what real step families go through. The characters in this movie weren't real. I was very disappointed.\nThe rest of the movie was bland, boring, and frankly, unbelievable. I mean, what mother can afford to take a child out on a twilight horse ride on a moments notice? And where, pray tell, is this fantastic New York suburb Sarandon lived in that afforded her pastoral views of mountains and woods? Did anyone miss the fact the Roberts worked in NYC and was mysteriously able to pick-up the stepkids at their birthday parties and schools in this lush suburb? Sorry, I grew up in that area of the East Coast and I'm still guessing where this suburb is.\nFind something better to do with 2 hours.

{"text": "Jason Gedrick is Doug Masters, teen-pilot ace, son of a USAF fighter pilot, AF academy hopeful and high-school failure.  Doug is normally not that responsible a kid (mostly when tooling around in low-level air races in the family Cessna), but is forced to mature when his father is shot down and taken prisoner over an unnamed mideastern country.  A naturally gifted pilot, Doug has managed to cajole his father into taking him on some practice flights in the past, as well as worming his way into the base's F-16 simulator.  Now with the help of \"Chappy\" Sinclair (Louis Gosset Jr.), a crusty but not rusty reserve fighter pilot, and some of Doug's friends - a click of army-brat and aviation enthusiast-teens who populate the unnamed desert air force base where Doug's father stages - the younger Masters plans an impossible rescue.  Together with Chappie, Doug seizes a pair of twin-seat F-16's, loads them up to maximum payload, and flies into hostile territory.\nThis movie came out in late 1985 and would have been toast had it appeared about six months later when \"Top Gun\" was released.  The premise is improbable, the flight scenes suffer in comparison to those in \"Top Gun\" (instead of the carefully choreographed dogfights and editing, IE has plenty of footage of the F-16's digital instruments - the flight scenes themselves look like stock footage and repetitive at that), special effects aren't great (enemy jets explode like toy models; the MiG blasted on the ground is not only an obvious dummy, but shot at the angle to make that most obvious; the sound is horrible)  and the realism is also pretty low apart from the premise - fully loaded F-16's aren't in any condition to dogfight (at least until the advent of the AIM-120 missile well after this movie came out), while flack guns seem almost entirely non-existent and enemy jets simply explode with the push of a button.\nStill, this was a fun movie and seemed to capture that sense of harmless (for our side anyway) jingoism of Reagan's 2nd term.  The plot goes a surprisingly long way into dealing with the inherent implausibility (Doug is good, but he's rough and his limits are well mapped out).  Also, much of the reason that IE falls behind TG has to do with the fact that F-16 isn't as photogenic as the F-14 (not that it's ugly - simply that it's smaller and hard to spot.  You simply see a speck that becomes an F-16 and disappears again in a flash, a deficiency on film that most F-16 pilots would doubtless prefer to live with).  The Israeli Kfir jets are quite convincing stand-ins for the MiG-23 (at the time, the US Marines flew leased Kfirs in dissimilar air-combat training), and only the most annoying military aviation enthusiasts will harp on how the USAF F-16's in the movie are painted according to Israeli colors (and how single-seat F-16A's mysteriously morph into twin-seat F-16B's and vica-versa).  Most of all, this was the first jet movie I'd really seen, and it was impressive enough for me to plunk down ($) for my first computer flight-sim program.  On a side-note, the soundtrack comes with \"One Vision\" by Queen, but the rest of the songs aren't up to that.  To get the song, I'd recommend Queen's own \"A Kind of Magic\" which also has some great tracks from the first Highlander movie.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Having seen \"Sorcerer\" back when I was a teen/young adult, (which I remember to this day as being an \"edge of your seat-er\" interesting & good  movie), I decided to try to get this movie after reading all the terrific & raving reviews about this \"original\" version. So on the reviews & advice of others here, I spent the time & money to finally get it.\n\nAfter watching it however, all I can say is that whoever thought this was good, must have seen it as a very young child & remembered it a lot better than it actually was. (I can't wait until the revamped \"Sorcerer\" Blu-ray comes out in a few months, so I can see if it is as good as I remember it, or is just as bad as this movie/version was! (I suppose it is possible my childhood memory of Sorcerer is as \"Off\" as other people's memory of this movie was!)\n\nBottom line, my recommendation... don't bother seeing this version. While interesting to see movies & places from so long ago, it isn't enough to make it worth sitting thru this. The only character you like will be killed off, & the others will do things throughout the movie that make you realize that their dying & being killed off is simply justice. And if their cruelty towards others is not enough, their blatant stupidity & ignorant actions merits their being removed from the gene-pool!\nIn short, having risked everything, used others & treated them like garbage & made it thru horrific, life threatening events, the main character gets so overwhelmed with his survival & reward, that he gets reckless & just drives off a cliff!\nNOT the plot of a great movie.\n\nWatch for a future review of Sorcerer someday. When I am able to watch it again & check to see if I remembered that movie correctly, or decide to add it to this one, of the \"don't bother seeing\" group.\nSorry to be so harsh about this one, but it was NOT as good as it could have been, & certainly NOT as good as people here claim it is.\n\nFor one thing, with the horrible way the main characters treat others, I end up not caring if they live or die, as I begin to feel they deserve to die! Also, in the movie's climatic tense moments, like when taking horrible risks to maneuver the trucks thru an area that is supposed to be hard to get thru, it was blatantly obvious that they could easily fit thru the area without any risk at all! Even my wife asked \"What is wrong with these guys? What is so hard about making that corner, as there is enough room for even me to do it!\"\nAnd then when success is finally had, the idiot has a death wish! Making the whole trip (& movie) for nothing! (It was even hard to be concerned about him making it back to the \"bar-girl\" whom he didn't even care about in the first place!", "label": 2}

{"text": "I am 25 years old right now, and the first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what they were trying to get across. Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was \"Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future.\" And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.", "label": 2}
{"text": "When I first heard that they were going to make a movie based of of one of my favorite video game franchises of all time I couldn't even begin to tell you the level of excitement I felt. I began climbing the walls with impatience and counting down the days until the films release. However after I viewed the movie I felt something completely different. Confusion and dissapointment, I couldn't believe that the film makers actually had the audacity to call this 'Resident Evil'. This movie goes against everything from the first resident evil game, and even finds new ways to annoy avid fans of the once great series of resident evil games.\n\nInstead of this movie following the Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. team an a mansion located in the Arklay mountains we instead follow a Spec Ops team hired by or created by Umbrella (I wonder why they don't just use the U.B.C.S.) a security operative, and environmentalist, and an Umbrella employee. So we are off to a pretty sad spot to begin with. This film feature zero, that is right, ZERO characters from the first resident evil game and doesn't even come close to even getting the basic premise correct. Instead of this taking place in a mansion, we are in an underground lab, instead of Jill or any other cool resident evil characters we get these, somewhat interesting, set of characters, we only get to see two B.O.W.s, and I really can't believe they did this but, they had the nerve to change the way the virus spread to Raccoon City. In the game William Burkin had just finished his work on the G-Virus when Umbrella sent mercenaries to retrieve the sample from him, morally wounding him in the process. With William's last breath he injects the g-virus into his system and attacks the mercs and destroys all viles of the g and t-virus. Some sewer rats start drinking and gnawing on the capsules and then spread the virus throughout the city. In this movie the idiot scientist decide \"hey lets jut re-open the lab that we know is filled with dangerous monsters and walkers so we can find out what happened instead of downloading the security footage from a secure location.\" Surprise surprise the virus runs rampant throughout the city.\n\nNow if the writers actually played the game, or even cared about the fans they wouldn't have had the movie end that way, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAs we journey throughout the new location (that being the underground lab) we get some really interesting scenery as we get to see locations of manufactured B.O.W.s' and even locations where they tested the T-virus and designed it. I was actually curious about where this road was taking us in terms of story, so as the Special Ops team is sent in to deactivate the lab's A.I. system they have to cut the power, which releases all of the walkers that were contained in the offices and testing room, and the group is forced to do battle. Here is where the movie actually becomes pretty interesting, sure this movie is a stab in the back to all fans of the games, however, there are still some entertaining moments of the film and this is certainly one of them. The group begin fighting the undead but are curious as to why they keep getting up no matter how many times they are shot in the torso.\n\n*Me personally, if I shot an attacker 7 times in the chest and they just shrug it off I'm going to aim for the head. To bad these characters would rather waste ammo than use their brains.\n\nOur survivors are then forced to fall back, but due to heavy zombie presence, are separated as the writers thankfully bring some parts of the resident evil games into this movie. What I mean by that is we get a licker, who shows up at the end of the movie, and zombie dogs. This is where I was very excited to see how authentic these B.O.W.'s would be, and they are very authentic and in fact very scary to see in a live action film.\n\nAlice wonders into a dog kennel and when I was watching this for the first time I said to myself \"Oh please, please don't be a tease\" and this anything but. It is here that we get an immensely satisfying battle between Alice and the zombie dogs as she takes on the entire kennel and even kills that last one with a pretty cool air kick to the face.\n\nAlice manages to regroup with Matthew and the others as they try and find a way out of the facility before they become trapped and left to die. They discover a way out through the maintenance tunnels only to get swarmed by walkers. They just barely make it out alive, but two of the remaining spec ops team members (Rain and Kaplan suffer bites and are now both infected) This is even worse for Rain as she was bitten earlier in the movie and now the infection is spreading even faster now. As they attempt to escape their current predicament one of the pipes breaks causing Kaplan to fall the zombie bit below, he survives his encounter and tells the group to leave him behind as they don't have nearly enough ammunition to kill the walkers and he is too far away for there to be any probable rescue. He unloads his revolver and realizes that he only has one bullet left, which he uses to dispose of a walker before crawling away.\n\nIt is here that the remaining members of the group (Alice,Matthew,Spence, and a very much infected Rain) journey through the labs where the virus was being tested and manufactured, it is also here that Alice remembers exactly where the cure was located as well. When they arrive to this location she discovers the cure to be missing and we find out who is responsible (it is Spence big surprise there) as he locks the group in the room after he receives a bite from a walker. He makes his way to the train where he had the cure and virus the entire time, only to die from a very hungry licker.\n\n*I was very excited to finally see this thing actually have some significance in the movie, for the most part it just wonders around the facility teasing the fans with its presence. Though I suppose they were ultimately building up suspense for the creatures inevitable battle with the few remaining survivors.\n\nKaplan rejoins the group as they make their way to the train, retrieve the cure and begin administering it to the infected members of the group (Rain and Kaplan).Only to have their happy moment interrupted by a still very hungry licker. Now we get, what I have to admit is a pretty cool battle. There is almost no stopping this beast, Alice even takes Rains .45 pistol and shoots three rounds point blank into its face and all that does is piss it off. But I have to complain about this part as well. In resident evil 2 you can discover a file that describes just how dangerous this monster is. The file says how its tongue cut a man apart, yet Alice gets hit right in the face with it and all that happens is she falls on her back.\n\nAfter defeating this monster the only survivors are Alice and Matthew, they make their way up to the mansion and are greeted by Umbrella scientists. Alice and Matthew are again separated and Alice regains consciousness in a hospital. She discovers that the city has been overrun and her battle is far from over.\n\nMy god this movie was disappointing, there is almost nothing recognizable about this movie. I find it highly insulting to even call this a 'resident evil'movie when so much is changed. They changed the story,characters,location, virtually everything is different. With all that has been aid I have to confess that I actually kind of like this movie. I know how it sounds but it is actually enjoyable, even with all of the flaws. I just don't understand why they call it resident evil when so much is different.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Chris Sarandon is terrific as Jerry Dandridge, the charming neighborhood vampire. In watching his performance one evening after I bought this tape, I finally understood why it was that the vampire story will never die, no matter how many stakes get driven into its heart: the near-death ecstasy and the orgasmic ecstasy are biochemically identical. Whether it is the act of creating human life or the act of taking it away- the human physical response is the same.  With the tale of the vampire, when the male vampire is in the act of ostensibly making love to his victim, we get both actions [ostensibly giving and taking] the same time.  The raw power of the scene in the book, \"Dracula,\" where the vampire baptizes Mina with his own blood, adds a third element to this powerful biochemical mix: a spiritual element, a religious esctasy.  We don't have this in \"Fright Night\", but instead we have the setting of an entirely normal central character and his friends, in an average town in Anywhere, America.  This \"brings it home\" in an unexpected way, as the spiritual aspect is replaced by a social one.  Context is the difference, one which is exploited very well.  And of course, the struggle of a fatherless boy trying to grow into manhood and the man finds himself fixating on [the vampire] adds another dimension.  The vampire has been a man and moved beyond it; Charley wants to be a man and finds that he is both helpless and threatened by the vampire.  And of course, the vampire is just as helpless under certain conditions and threatened by almost everything in the ordinary daylight world- Charley through the looking glass.\nRoddy McDowell shines in his role as the washed-up B-movie star.

{"text": "Just saw The Crossing tonight.  I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan.  I thought the scenery and costumes were great, battle recreations great, but as a whole the film fell short.  Numerous historical inaccuracies and important omissions, and a seeming obsession to make sure we knew that every character in the plot was a bawdy-talking, cussing, irreverent man of the world.  It was really over the top.  No way will I show this to my kids; not just that the cussing is excessive, but it's probably historically inaccurate and the portrayal certainly unbalanced.  In fact, at times the course language seemed to become the main POINT of the film rather than the historical significance of what was happening.  And we know from numerous histories and accounts written at the time by eyewitnesses that even though Washington had a bad temper, he restrained it and only used curse words on rare occasions (historical accounts indicate the shock by his staff when he cursed out Gen. Charles Lee at the Battle of Monmouth, because it was so uncharacteristic of him to use foul language and he actually ordered his soldiers not to do so).\n\nHistorical inaccuracies and important omissions abound: After the battle, Washington orders a retreat back across the Delaware; in reality, the army stayed in NJ and laid another trap for the British which ended up in a follow-up victory at Princeton.  And the attack on Trenton also included a planned second crossing that never materialized, adding drama that this film ignored.\n\nOn top of that, Daniels' portrayal of Washington seemed off compared to what you read by men of the time, including the soldiers who fought with him.  He was known as a hard man, but a also a gentleman much loved by those around him (other than the ambitious would-be usurpers); but in The Crossing, he just comes across as a hard man, and at times a jerk.  It was not a portrayal that seemed credible--who would follow this guy into battle?\n\nFinally, and perhaps worst, we end with a totally fictional bit of ideological, PC revisionism when American Gen. Nathaniel Greene scolds Washington for his idealism, reminding him that the Revolution is all about the Colonists' greed, which Greene says is no different than that of the Hessians.  What??  That was the last straw for me.\n\nThe Crossing isn't a good history lesson at all, other than the outdoor scenes.\n\nHugely disappointing.", "label": 0}

The English get most of the blame in the end, as the church  Inquisitors try to exonerate her but in the end declaring her to be a  martyr for the English.\nIn comparison, the video Joan of Arc played by  Leelee Sobieski has a much better and believable plot than this one.

{"text": "'Easy Rider' tells of two bikers (Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper) traveling through the Southwest and South set in the 1960s. Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.\n\nThe two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.\n\nThe movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.\n\nOverall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.", "label": 2}
{"text": "If you ask whether or not 'The Grudge' is really creepy, yes, it is, but I think horror film fans would find the film as a whole is trying to be too clever.  It features American actors but is set in Japan (directed by Japanese Takashi Shimizu), and moreover throws away the usual chronological order to tell the story, very unusual storytelling method in horror films.\n\nWith this non-linear approach, the film can be ambitious.  So what you see in the first scene is the most shocking.  You see Bill Pullman staring at the city of Tokyo, from the window of an apartment.  Then, wow, a big surprise comes.\n\nSara Michelle Geller is nominal star of the film, but the real feature is actually the evil power that must be dwelling in the apparently ordinaly small, Japanese-style house in Tokyo.  It is soon revealed that in that place some terrible incidents happen to the visitors, including Ms. Geller's character Karen, American exchange student, or other people (mostly Americans, including Clea Duvall or Jason Behr as Geller's boyfriend).\n\n[SURELY CREEPY] The film is surely creepy, and the film comes with the carefully controled sound effects (as in 'The Ringu' or 'Ju-On' the latter being the original version of this film).  The atmosphere of Tokyo is captured very well, and the 'lost' sense of American visitors in this city is presented convincingly.  (Incidentally, you can see the same downtown street of Shinjuku, as was seen in 'Lost in Translation'.)\n\nBut horror fans would soon realize that director Shimizu uses some conventional scares -- like sudden big noises -- and the film often looks as if too eager to be scary.  In the latter half, the film begins to show its defects -- it is repetitious.  People are killed, or intimidated, by Toshio and Kayako (evil spirits played by the same actors as Japanese versions), but ... it is as if we see too much of them, maybe more than Ms. Geller herself.\n\n[IN A NUTSHELL] the problem is this.  In the beginning of the film, you see THE GRUDGE IS THE CURSE OF THE ONE WHO DIES IN THE GRIP OF POWERFUL RAGE. and that curse is, it says PASSED, LIKE A VIRUS, FROM VICTIM TO VICTIM IN AN ENDLESS, GROWING CHAIN OF HORROR.  Yes, it looks endless, in a bad way.\n\nPerhaps the film's history is more interesting than the Hollywood remake itself.  The original 'Ju-on' and its sequel (shot at the same time) were made-for-video short films.  Then, two theatrical films were made, AND this Hollywood remake.  The franchize spread like a virus.  And they are planning to make another one.  It's time to stop that, isn't it?", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's \"Top 100 films of all time\" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.\n\nDennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.\n\nJack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.\n\nThe cinematography is very good. Lszl Kovcs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.\n\nI'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.\n\nMy rating: 2 of 5", "label": 0}

Yet I can't help but agree with one review which I have seen here which rates it at only a single star and that everything else here is either misguided or overly-generous.\nI came to this film via Rushmore which was a sublime and enjoyable film. Unfortunately Bottle Rocket is nothing more than a rehearsal for Rushmore where Anderson got hold of a decent story and some wonderful actors (it's telling that the much of the incidental music in Rushmore is lifted from this film).\nHere the story is stilted, the dialogue lacks any of the zip needed for a comedy, while the acting is unremarkable at best and cringe worthy at worst. I spent a long time trying to nail down what this film is about but I suspect it is really about nothing, and that it was simply an exercise in getting a movie made that would help secure the necessary funding for Rushmore. If it did that, then at least it deserves the single star.\nIf Bottle Rocket had stayed as a short film I would have had no qualms with it but it really has no legs as a feature-length film. Sadly this is the only movie I have ever bought that I actually threw out - and it cost me a fair bit to order it from the States! Bought as a present for my Rushmore-loving sister she was bemused at first and then immensely disappointed.\nI think the mundane but true fact is that almost every film-maker with a few movies under their belt will direct a stinker - this has got to be Anderson's - but he's already proved that he can make a quirky film that is engaging and entertaining.

I was in grade school when this movie came out and 2 scenes will be forever etched in my mind until I die. The first being where Jillian is heading towards her house as the night sky parts with these eerie and brilliant lights descending from above. That was just downright scary because their trajectory is taking them straight to the side of her home.\n\nThe second scene came moments later where Jillian's son, Barry is being pulled in a very frightening tug-of-war between mother and alien through the pet slot in the doorway! The music and the lighting increased the tension of that scene to such a crescendo! That entire segment was so frightening because you could barely see the aliens fingers latched onto Barry's arms. To this day, I've argued that Jillian \"lost\" the tug-of-war because the aliens were simply stronger than she was instead of several people insisting that she let Barry go as not to hurt him for fear of her son being pulled apart or injured.\n\nI'm no parent, but I've always believed that a parent will go through great lengths to keep her child protected or die trying and not give up so easily. But that's me. As far as the movie is concerned, it'll always be a 5-star rating. My 3 stars are in reference to the Blu-ray transfer. I will admit, that my Blu-ray transfer expectations were a bit high. Okay, very high:) I'd just watched the incredible The Dark Knight on Blu-ray and that just blew my mind!\n\nThe transfer for this movie is not too bad, it's just not as great as I was expecting it to be. Especially with it being the 30th anniversary edition. But that's totally my fault. The sound however is incredible and some scenes look more sharper and crisper than others which was annoying. There were spotty graininess in some scenes and that disappointed me too. That's not to say that I lost my money purchasing this item. One of the pluses of this disc is that it contains all three versions. I really loved that. My personal favorite has always been the Director's Cut, but all three of them are pretty good.\n\nIt's funny because I wonder if the 3 versions on the 1 disc have somehow retarded the sharpness of the Blu-ray process itself. It's worth taking into consideration because not many discs have 3 different versions of the same movie on 1 disc; maybe alternate endings, but not an entire movie. That's been my experience anyway. With that said, I'm still glad that I got this movie and in this format as well. Watching Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind never gets old.

Hopper as a director has this highly annoying gimmick of  falshing frames of the next scene twice before actually moving onto it, and  he doesn't do it once but throughout the film. Now I'm aware that this  gimmickry might have been revolutionary back in the sixties, but now it  only breaks the flow of a film that is already hard to sit through. The  movie consists of endless shots of Fonda and Hopper on their bike, and not  much else, but it does however recieve a major jolt with Jack Nicholson's  arrival, he briefly awakens this movie out of its slumber. Unfortunatly  he's not on for long, and we're back to Fonda and Hopper on bikes.

{"text": "I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.\nSo, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song \"That's How The Numbers Go\" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)\nAlthough there is one good clip - \"Martian Beauty #9,\" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm \"#11 rap,\" which shows pictures of 11 things, and \"Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,\" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.  Yawn.", "label": 2}

Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the French king to be and then king to opportunism. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play. He could have written a masterpiece on the subject.

The film is not a great piece of cinema drama or even suspense.  The character development is a little shallow and the acting a tad weak.  I have not read the Krakauer book but my guess is that it is much better.  I imagine this might sound a tad mean but I was actually happy when a few people died (in the movie not real life) because they were being brash and annoying.\n\nStill the film is entertaining because I think it captures the dangers of climbing when you do not follow through with the game plan and act like a total bafoon, which the film recreates.  I do not know if this was the real situation for the climbers.  It seems like some of the individuals climbing should not have been a part of the expedition on Everest.

Sure, as a guy I can understand why those three things are appealing to my gender (although I am far from a sports fan) but I have never been one to hide my deeper feelings or emotions.  I cry whenever I want to; I have deep and meaningful conversations with my male friends and I definitely watch whatever it is that I want to regardless of the intended fan base.\n\nI say this, not because I think that this is a particularly good movie but because this seems to be a popular movie that men feel unabashedly ashamed in either watching or enjoying or, god forbid, crying at.\n\nThe film tells the story of a group of women who frequent the same hair salon and become a central part of each others lives over the years.  There is M'Lynn, the kind hearted mother who only wants what is best for her daughter Shelby, who just so happens to be a serious diabetic.  There is Truvy, who owns the salon, and Annelle, her new employee with a background no one is too sure about.  There is the loudmouthed Ouiser and her loyal friend Clairee.\n\nTogether they make for one lively bunch.\n\nThe film mostly focuses on M'Lynn and Shelby as they struggle to come to terms with Shelby's growing independence.  Shelby wants to get married and have children, but the doctors have warned her that childbirth will not be a smart move for someone in her condition.  M'Lynn wants to allow her daughter to live her own life, but she also is the mother and mothers always know what is best for their children; right?\n\nThe film is tragically clich&eacute;d, which probably adds to the memorable factor, since we've seen it all before, but it takes away from the originality and my personal overall appreciation of the film.  It's also very heavy handed, and it's not always smooth about it either.  The acting is a bit spotty, sometimes so over the top it's annoying and other times so grounded in itself that it is stunningly superb.\n\nLet's look at the two opposite ends of the spectrum; Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field.  Two of my favorite actresses of all time spar off and only one is the victor; Field.  Sally Field delivers what may be her finest performance ever, delving deep into the maternal spectrum of this woman's very being.  M'Lynn aches to see her daughter live a full life, but she cannot look past the fact that a full life may very well kill her.  It's heartbreaking to say the least.  Shirley MacLaine, who may even be a better actress as a whole, is ridiculously overacting throughout this film.  Her mannerisms are all over the place and her characters comedic timing borders on annoying.  It's shameful, which is sad, because I love her.\n\nOlympia Dukakis is stunning here, Dolly Parton is fun and Daryl Hannah is effectively nave, even if neither do a whole lot to be remembered for.  Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and was the favorite to win (although she lost) but her performance is decent at best, never really investing itself as deeply as Field's.  She does a fine job, but nothing spectacular.\n\nSo, did this movie make me cry?  Yes, it did, and I am not ashamed to say that.  The ending is such a heartbreaker, and Field is so convincing in her tragic portrayal that anyone who doesn't cry is made of stone, really.  Is the movie really as amazing as many make it out to be?  No, not really.  It works to an extent and sports a beautiful performance but its own clich&eacute;s and spotty collective ensemble tear it down a few notches and keep it from being the classic many want it to be.  See it for Field, for she is heaven-sent, but don't expect too much from the film as a whole.", "label": 2}

Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.

{"text": "\"The Deep End of the Ocean\" is based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel. It's the story of a busy mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose son Ben is kidnapped at the age of three. Nine years later, Ben is found and is reunited with his family, but he doesn't have much interest in getting to know them and is resentful about being yanked out of his old life.\n\nI enjoyed this movie. It's pretty true to the novel, and the few things that were changed for the film aren't all that important. I think the biggest difference between the book and the movie is that the character of Beth is much more toned-down and sympathetic on the big screen than she is on paper. Mitchard's version of the character is more interesting and complex, but I can see why the producers probably thought it wouldn't do well on the big screen. Pfeiffer delivers a strong performance, as does Jonathan Jackson, who plays the oldest Cappadora son, Vincent. The only casting decision that left me puzzled is Whoopi Goldberg, who is probably the last person on earth I would have picked to play Detective Candy Bliss, but oh well.\n\nBottom line: This is a good, solid film.

{"text": "Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.\n\nThe struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.\n\nThe film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.", "label": 0}

It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin.\nIt's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them.\nFurthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?\nOther than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.\nIt's just a terrible movie.

The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.\n\nUnfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.\n\nIt would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.\n\nIf you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This film about two brothers growing up at the turn of the century is full of great river and countryside scenes. Life is shown as it was before radio and T.V. The quiet in the house and how people worked and lived in those days was interesting. The movie touches on love and how families drift apart no matter how hard people try to keep them together. Tom Skerrit does a great job as their father who also is a minister who loves to fish. Going to college back then meant taking a train to a far away state and having to write letters back to your family for communication; very different from our lives. Families and communities did things together back them more than now,as choices for entertainment were limited. The film also shows the brother's and father's love for the river and for fishing. It also has some very sad parts which leave the viewer thinking about their own life and what's really important to them.

{"text": "There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.\n\nThe first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.\n\nFor an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.\n\nDon't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.\n\nThe DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Oh the days before TSA, unfriendly sky, smart phone, and speed trap.  These are what make this film very dated.  One character was using the \"brick\" cell phone in one scene.  What a hoot to see that phone!\n\nRom com films are escapism.  However, the dramatic tension between the two main, Tomei and Downey Jr., is weird.  It was probably because both of them were Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy.  Both leads sharing the same disposition and stereotype doesn't create tension nor is it as relateable.  A better rom com and not as dated from the same period is While You Were Sleeping.  I got into it much better than \"Only You\".\n\nHowever, there are 2 reasons that recommend this film:\n\n1. Location\nIt's an ode to Italy.  I just did a one month trip in Italy and was at all the locations the film had used, Venice, San Gimignano, Rome, and Positano.  I have a feeling the hotels in Rome and Positano are not on location but sets.  Also, train is very fast and convenient in Italy (yes, even in 1990).  Why rent a car to drive from Venice to Rome, if only for the sole purpose of going thru Tuscany and a far shot of San Gimignano?  I was thinking it's probably before the speed traps.  Now, one can't drive in Tuscany countryside without running the risk of getting a ticket in the mail months after the trip ended.\n\n2. Wardrobe\nThis is about the only thing not dated in this film.  Tomei and Hunt's clothes and shoes are to die for.  They are still as classy and tasteful today as in 1990.  Tomei and Hunt were at the prime of their beauty and it shows.  Tomei's outfits were classy with a hint of sexiness and whimsy, very becoming.\n\nIf you have a weakness for Italy and fashion, I recommend this film.", "label": 2}

It is NOT, however, fast paced and overly worried about the instant gratification of its audience... you have to sit there and let the cumulative effect of the film wash over you, and THEN you might say, \"wow, that wasn't bad.\"  Also, though the movie features much more intelligence and depth than most horror films these days (especially the gore-spattered R-rated offerings in the multi-plexes every few weeks), the story isn't nearly as complex as it initially seems.  Once you see the whole movie and re-construct the timeline in your head in a normal, linear fashion, the movie is actually no more complicated than your average \"Friday the 13th\" entry.  It just tells its simple story better than most other horror movies tell their simple stories.  But there's nothing wrong with that, so, in the end, I say give \"The Grudge\" a whirl.

He then falls for a woman played by Cybil Sheppard as well as later falls for a prostitute played by a young Jodie Foster.\n\nDe Niro's character is driven to madness and buys guns so that he can save Foster from her kidnappers.

She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.\n\n The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.\n Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.\n\nIf you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.

{"text": "Easy Rider is a counterculture touchstone.  It also was a trailblazer in the independent film market.  There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.  There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.  Jack Nicholson shows up as a drunk who is constantly being jailed.  He rides along with Mr. Hopper & Mr. Fonda and meets an untimely death. The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.  The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.  Before Easy Rider, you had to play within the system.  After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.", "label": 2}

She's too all-American, too garden-variety-pretty, too much the cheerleader type.  It's not that she doesn't have acting chops in general -- she's normally an excellent actress -- but she doesn't have what it takes to carry off this role.  She even resorts to a kind of kooky, indefinable, faux-foreign accent at times, to signal, I suppose, that Ellen has been living in Europe for years.  She's just all wrong.  That's why I give this otherwise spectacular film only 3 stars.  Imagine what a more appropriate actress could have done with this role!

{"text": "This one should have been \"The Night of the Living Dead\" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's \"Mortal Kombat\" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that \"Resident Evil\" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.\nAnd speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch \"The Fast and the Furious\". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.\nIt's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\".\nTRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised.

That does not mean that this is exactly what happened to Billy Hayes or that this is exactly how the prisons are in Turkey. This is Oliver Stone's writing at it's best. I loved this movie.\nBrad Davis is phenomenal as Billy Hayes and it's a shame that he couldn't get his own real life together and become the star he should have become. Brad reminded me a lot of James Dean in this film. His acting, his looks, even the way he spoke. It was quite eerie actually. Brad deserved much better than one memorable film and a death, so cruel.\nThis is supposed to be a 20th Anniversary Edition dvd, which would suggest commentaries, deleted scenes and a host of other extras, but there is none of this. ...It's a real drag that this film doesn't get the proper dvd treatment it deserves. The featurette is nothing more than a VERY SHORT documentary on the life of the real Billy Hayes that was made in the late 70's. If you're looking for new information, you've come to the wrong place. The only thing that's great about this dvd is the transfer. It looks great for the most part, crisp and clean with very few artifacts and very little edge enhancement, though some of the scenes were very dark, which is probably the way they were originally shot. I'm not sure if it's just my dvd or if everyone else's dvd has a problem, but when Billy is meeting his Turkish lawyer for the first time and they are shaking hands they're is a slight \"roll\" in the dvd. Kind of like if you were watching this movie in the theater and the projector got hung up for a frame or two. It's not that bad but I thought I would mention it.\nThis is a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen it.

I know it's difficult to transfer a stage play to film, but Annie would seem to be easier than most, as it already has a big cast and multiple settings. This just isn't a very compelling movie for three reasons: 1) They added songs and took out others. The new songs don't have the \"oomph\" of the original show tunes. In a word, they're boring. 2) John Huston's direction drags, drags, drags. 3) I'm going to say it--Aileen Quinn just didn't have the spark Annie needs. She has no edge, no genuine spunk.

{"text": "This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.\n\nUnfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clichs in abundance.\n\nWhat's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.\n\nLike I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than \"OK\" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.  Well, being a hardcore fantasy and SF viewer, I've certainly seen plenty of worse stuff.", "label": 2}
{"text": "As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that \"Frosty Returns\" is not the sequel to \"Frosty the Snowman\", you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.\n\nIF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.\n\nAND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\".", "label": 1}

There's a good message at the core of this one, about the impenetrable veneer expected of men from his generation and the dire effects it bore on those around him. Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs. There's simply too much to keep track of, and too much time wasted with characters we don't care about.

{"text": "I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out in 1969. Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies. See this as a piece of history, and maybe even entertainment, if you are nostalgic for the 60s.", "label": 2}

Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile.

Every movement of feet on the stage can be heard.  Musically, I feel the performance is adequate -- not great, but not bad either.  I was most disappointed in the acting and dramatic delivery of the singers.  I found the acting to be very one-dimensional (especially Kaibaivanska as Butterfly), flat, and lacking in emotion.

Then you've probably turned to sci-fi to live out your dystopian (or utopian) fantasies. So in the never-ending quest for the right drug, take the blue pill. Blue Thunder, that is. Blue Thunder explores all possible options for expostion. Such a revisionist history usually attempts to redefine science fiction in film-specific terms, opting variously for epistemologically based or image-based criteria instead of the source-based or narrative-based assumptions that have so far shaped most discussions of SF film. Not so with Ol' Blue Thunder. Central to the genius of this film is the reconsideration of the question of whether cinemato graphic aspects of film production could themselves mark film as science fictional or provide in themselves phenomena worthy of consideration by the SF community--the spectacle of production technology deserving and rewarding our attention just as surely as do narratives about the impact of technology. And the SF community would have a lot better things to talk about than cinemato graphic aspects if they did the wild thing more often, instead of drooling over Captain Kirk's tush in Star Trek! The fleeting colaboration of brilliant thespian (Rob Schneider) and brilliant director (John Badham), combined with the building blocks of life known as craft service (oh yeah, and let's not forget the writers!) made one tour de force without the tour or the force, so I guess this film is just made of \"de\" (get it?)

The movie slowly climaxes, then dives at a different angle to a slow point where the three characters, Anthony, Bob, and Dignan don't talk to each other for about 20 minutes of the movie. This slowness takes away from the humor aspects of the movie because it drags too long.  Otherwise the humor before this portion is as charming and crass as watching I Heart Huckabees.  The build up of the movie afterward is funny in a weird way, but not too many people would probably think that Michael lusting for almost non-English speaking hotel maid Anita was funny.  They might think it was just plain dumb.  Brothers Luke and Owen really portray their talented acting as you really feel they are the characters they play.  Owen Wilson's character's crazy obsessing with trying to plan crimes as a mastermind, and being very good at it.

{"text": "A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film \"Last Action Hero\".\n\nThe film was directed by John McTiernan (\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\", \"The 13th Warrior\", \"The Thomas Crown Affair\") and a screenplay by Shane Black (\"Lethal Weapon\" films, \"The Monster Squad\", \"The Last Boy Scout\") and David Arnot (\"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane\").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler (\"Bruce Almighty\", \"The Alamo\", \"The Longest Yard\", \"2012') and music by Michael Kamen (\"X-Men\", \"Band of Brothers\", \"Frequency)\".\n\nAn expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.\n\nThe film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.\n\nThe problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.\n\nWith the release of \"Jack Slater IV\", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.\n\nNick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for \"Jack Slater IV\" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.\n\nAs the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.\n\nIn the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.\n\nCan Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n\"Last Action Hero\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Air Force One\" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.\n\nFor a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of \"Last Action Hero\".\n\nNow, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that \"Last Action Hero\" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.\n\nThe opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!\n\nSubtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n\"Last Action Hero\" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nWhen \"Last Action Hero\" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.\n\nBut I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, \"Last Action Hero\" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", there was high expectations.\n\nNeedless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, \"Last Action Hero\" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.\n\nFor those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.\n\nOverall, \"Last Action Hero\" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.", "label": 2}

{"text": "What a roller coaster ride of a movie. I say this not because it had me at the edge of my seat with excitement but because it made me vomit allover myself. Wow, where do I even begin? Ok how about this? You know how a movie can be so bad that in a way its actually kind of good. Well this movie was so bad that it just flew past that point quicker than Rick James' heartbeat after a 4 day coke binge, and then went back around full circle to being just plan horrible.\n\nI don't know how this can even be characterized as a movie because a movie requires a plot of some kind. I could have taken a blank piece of paper. Conjured up the biggest loogie that I could possibly make. One with a small solid chunk in it and with a nice faint yellowish hue. Spit it on the paper and have made a better script then the one used in this movie. There must have been something wrong with either the tape I was viewing or my VCR, because about halfway through, the picture fluttered and the screen went blue for about 7mins. I witnessed more plot turns and more character development in this 7min span of blue screen, then I did throughout the whole rest of the movie.\n\nThis movie left me so violated that at the ending credits I felt like a preschooler leaving the Never Land Ranch after a week long slumber party. At one point I just couldn't take anymore. I tried to stand and walk to the TV to shut it off, but I was so mentally and physically exhausted from viewing this movie that I couldn't even make it to my feet. Watching this movie required the use of muscles that I don't usually use on a regular basis. My body actually physically ached with soreness for 3 days after viewing this sick joke of a film. During one of the musical montages I sincerely feared that my brain cells may try to euthanize themselves to avoid enduring this torture any longer. The extent of psychological damage this movie has caused me is immeasurable. I now have recurring Nam flashbacks and I didn't even fight in Nam. Sometimes I'll just start weeping out of the blue like when Richard Simmons consoles a grossly overweight woman. I developed a drinking habit. I lost my job. All the hopes and dreams I once had are now lost, just like the fat from around Jarrids' midsection, all because of \"Spice World\"\n\nDirector Bob Spiers should receive a beating so bad that The Gooch wouldn't even unleash it upon Arnold Jackson, for recording these ghastly events on film. If the spermaceti that was responsible for producing Bob Spiers knew that he would later go on to make this movie. It would have screamed out kamikaze and took a fatal dive into the sticky mucus lining of the fallopian tubes, instead of fertilizing the egg. Just think about how destructive, to the whole human race, Spice World can be. This next statement may sound very farfetched but in all likelihood it's not completely inconceivable. God forbid this would ever happen, but for a moment just imagine that all intelligent life on this planet was eradicated by some sort of plague. Now imagine that after hundreds of thousands of years a new race were to discover our planet and start studying who we were and how we lived. Imagine how they would marvel at some of our discoveries and inventions. They would be mesmerized by the huge skyscrapers we erected. Our knowledge of medicine, electricity, the automobile, the computer, and the family size George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reduceing Grilling Machine with bun warmer. They would be awed by some of our great poets, artists and philosophers. Just imagine what they would learn from us. Imagine the respect and admiration they would have for us. That is until one of them were to unearth \"Spice World\". The respect they once had for our hole race would be taken back faster than a bowl of cereal from Trix The Rabbit. Where we were once hailed as kings we would now be reduced to nothing more than the butts of their jokes like blondes, the Polish and Janet Jacksons' Nipple. All because of \"Spice World\".\n\nSo in closeing. Whatever you do, do not buy or watch this movie, and if for some reason you already own it at least make sure you keep it locked up tighter then Martha Stewart. It may help preserve our good name in the long run.", "label": 0}

The zombies in the movie seem to hiss and growl more like tigers than flesh eating zombies, the dogs seem to be easily taken down, and as for the mutants, what mutants?  Except for that ONE.  For any true horror fan, i'd suggest playing a resident evil game (try the one on gamecube or re 2) watch the movie and if you're impressed by the movie then hooray for you.  I can honestly say that i was greatly dissapointed by the movie.  I gave it an extra star only because I could see it as another movie other than Resident Evil.  The movie did not do the game any justice.  If you're thinking \"oh this person is just an re fan\" you're right.  I just don't think the movie should have been called Resident Evil.  If they weren't going to make it right, then they shouldn't have made it at all. If it was like the game, it would have totally and inevitably been a horror classic.  Garunteed\nNow, even if i weren't a fan, then I would say that the zombies were too clean, there was nothing scary.  How can it?  Not with that soundtrack.  There were times when I wanted to yell out Mortal Kombat.  I didn't care if any of the characters survived or died.

{"text": "When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two.\nThe primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic.\nOne credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, \"why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?\"  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus.\nThey seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the \"Saturday Night Divas\" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other.\nThere are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment.\nThere are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders.\nI doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  \"The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.\"  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  \"I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.\"  Hint:  his last hit single.\nThe performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  \"Too Much\", \"Do It\", \"Say You Will Be There\", \"Mama\", \"Denying\", \"Saturday Night Divas\", \"Stop\", \"2 Become 1\", \"Leader Of The Gang\", \"Never Give Up On The Good Times\", \"My Boy Lollipop\", \"Wannabe\", \"Viva Forever\", \"Who Do You Think You Are\", \"Spice Up Your Life\", and \"The Lady Is A Vamp.\"\nHad I reviewed this in the throes of my Spice-induced euphoria of 1998, I would have given this the max.

{"text": "I admit to seeing the made-for-television version of Joan of Arc before viewing this version. If it makes a difference, I also read Mark Twain's \"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc\" that previous weekend, regardless of my dislike of Twain's writing style. I admit to thinking of this logical, honest, and energetic historical figure as one of the most fascinating in history. So, after viewing the scewed version called \"The Messenger\" I am perhaps too biased to speak.\n  The Joan portrayed in \"The Messanger\" comes off as tempermental, insecure, and ultimately insane. This is not the Joan that is recorded in history as a kind and forgiving peasant who touched the hearts of thousands by loving them, and who never spoke ill of anyone. This is not the Joan that led fifty intelligent judges in circles of words by answering calmly, consistently, and logically all answers that were intended to lead her to the stake. This is not the Joan who claimed to hear the voices of saints who informed her of events long before they happen. No, this \"messenger\", in the midst of a cinematic mess, is a horrifying psychotic who doesnot possess the conviction that would make an army wake up let alone fight an imposible war.\n  I did not like this movie. I leave you to make your own opinion, but consider that Joan of Arc was a seventeen-year-old peasant who claimed to hear heavenly voices, created a vast army and battle tactics that won back much of France, and was burned at the stake as a heretic before being declared a Saint. There are many interptretations of this historical figure, and although I am perhaps biased by my previous exposures, I don't feel that \"the messenger\" should be one of them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.\n\nEvery problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.\n\nDespite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.", "label": 0}

It is supposed to be one of those \"southern themed\" shows of the late 80s/90s that was pretty persistent in American culture then for whatever reason. Anyway, it was almost as if this movie tried to make being southern \"hip\"/\"cool\". They were portrayed as foul, immoral, eccentric air heads. Dunno. Maybe there was still some of the typical US socio-economic put down in there. Who knows? Anyway, the movie is over the top with this drama and sensationalism. I mean I have known people with diabetes before. Some who died from it as they had a horrific life with it--uncontrollable. But I have never seen any take a fit smacking at their new hair do like the Roberts character did. Just goofy. Kinda laugh out loud. Anyway, the one \"Christian\" in the movie was of course just an \"embarrassment annoyance\" designed to frame such people as such. We of course get to see Sally Field cry AGAIN.

{"text": "A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This was a pretty good movie with some strong yet cynical points about the world. Robert De Niro (my hero of actors), in one of his early roles, plays Travis Bickle, the taxi driver who grows depressed with the world around him. He sees violence and evil in people, and when he sets out to save a young prostitute, he uses violence and takes the law into his own hands. The controversy at the end is whether or not he is a hero for saving the prostitue from her pimp, or if he's a bad man for using violence to solve the problem. Now, I liked this film. I was expecting a little more though. Some things really were misleading, kind of confusing, and at times, a little bit boring. The story was dark, and some scenes seemed to have no meaning to them. But, all in all the movie isn't that bad. I don't see why it is deemed a classic though. It's not all that great. I read another review that suggested seeing it more than once in order to understand it. Maybe that's what I need to do, watch the movie again and maybe I'll enjoy it more. I enjoyed the memorable scene in which Robert De Niro utters the ever popular quote \"Are you talkin' to me?\" and aims a gun at the mirror. I also think it's a cool part when De Niro puts his hand over a flame. I recommend this movie for those who are interested in the early days of De Niro's career, and for those who want to see a cynical portrayal of the world through the eyes of a demented man.", "label": 2}

This one just falls into typical Friday The 13th type 80's slasher feel in the second half. Not that that's bad. It can be fun. Just don't expect anything from it. Jennifer Love Hewitt is okay in this, but the appeal she had in the first isn't quite here in this one. She seems to be there just to have really hot shots of her body which, um, well, okay, that wasn't a bad thing. Brandy, on the other hand, was wasted. Why was she in this?. Why did she agree to do this?. Freddie Prinze Jr. was another one who was wasted. He got second billing but his part is much smaller than any of the other co-stars. What happened?. The fishermen killer himself was creepy in the first one. Not here. His creepiness was ruined because you see way too much of him in this film. That always hurts a film and character.

Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as \"Take the Money and Run\" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.\n\nUnfortunately, the full-frame version of \"Take the Money and Run\" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.\n\nBut, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.

{"text": "Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.\n\nIs the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.\n\nFans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.\n\nResident Evil was rated R for \"Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity.\" Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is \"Language.\" I recall but one \"F\" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the \"Strong Violence\" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, \"the blood coagulates only after the body is dead.\" Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.\n\nFurthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.\n\nIt's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.\n\nNote: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that.\n\nBy: Christopher Curry", "label": 0}

It's slightly better than Face/Off maybe,but it still very poor. The action itself is slow moving and uninvolving,and nothing that hasn't been done ten times better and to more exciting effect in earlier highjack features like Passenger 57 and Under Siege. Harrison Ford is nauseatingly mundane,routine in his leading man role,doing the usual mumbling act he's done in previous action roles. He's showing his age really badly too (but he still should have got the role as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears instead of Ben Affleck,dagnammit!)Meanwhile,Gary Oldman is laughably OTT as the rashan terrorist ,while Glen Close and William H. Macy are totally wasted in their roles. The story itself is completely unbelievable and insults the viewer's intelligence beyond breaking point. For one example out of many others,in one scene,Ford uses a mobile phone to make contact with Close and we all know that in real life,this would cause the plane to crash. And towards the end,it doesn't half drag on like anything,just when I thought this dire mess was coming to and end,it just went on more and more until I was close to just turning it off and walking out. For an impressive instance of Ford's action man status,check out his turns as Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games.

And, anyone removed from the experience of working in the REAL U.S. Air Force can forgive the gross oversight and disregard for detail that this film shames upon the U.S. armed forces.  We all must overlook the details in most movies.\nHowever, this inane and unplausible plot is not saved by the thrill of a boy hopping in a slick military plane and the ensuing \"save the world\" 8-year-old fantasy.  The storyline would make much more sense if the hero/child Doug Masters actually were a 5-year-old boy who wandered away from his nanny and happened upon an Air Force jet.  Then, the film could be enjoyed for its ridiculousness.\nThe memory of seeing repeated glimpses of this movie repeated on HBO 18 years ago reminds me of how well this film captured the \"Worst Movie Ever\" in my book.

Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  It was hard to watch the end though with the conscience (Dustin Hoffman) but when you are called by God to do something it often doesn't make sense- even to you and you are tormented with whether it is really God or your ego.

It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.

{"text": "THE STORY:  Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys.  Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is a bad movie, straight up boring.  \"SLC Poser\" would be a more appropriate title, since the real crux of the film (which is explicit in the bumbling script) is protagonist Steve-O's realization that he has no  investment in any of the values he claims to hold so dear.  Neither does  the film, of course, and this movie is the cinematic equivalent of your  parents telling you you'll grow out of it.  If you're anything like the  punks in the movie, you will.  The version of punk shown here is like a  hissy fit being thrown by a spoilt child.\nPerhaps worst of all this  film's crimes is the totally inappropriate production value.  MTV-style  quick cutting and super glossy film stock give this movie the atmosphere of  a Saturday morning cartoon, albeit one where \"f you\" is the tag  line that all the talking action figures say.  Steve-O's obnoxious mugging  and his sidekick Bob's lame \"dude\"-isms only make this worse.  Even at its most superficial, punk is always gritty and unrefined, these  production techniques are more suited to \"hackers\"-esque  technopop flicks.\nI usually enjoy punxploitation film, but even the  soundtrack here feels tacked-on and jumbled.  Good punk films like  \"Suburbia\" make the punk elements feel organic, and have at least  a hint of empathy.  I never felt a thing in SLC Punk, even at the hackneyed  tragic ending, because who cares what happens to a bunch of rich frat boys  with mohawks?  Besides, every punk in this movie has perfect skin, so you  know it's just Hollywood exploitation.", "label": 0}

{"text": "TV History reveals new and fascinating facts, either hitherto unknown, or previously ignored.\n\nViewers are informed, twice, that at least two general officers in the Continental Army shaved with cold water, one of them being the army's commander-in-chief.\n\nWhile Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton became legendary for his hospitality, and especially for the generous helpings served to guests on a groaning dinner table. His expertise in carving a roast may have originated years earlier in a small cabin on the outskirts of Trenton, New Jersey, where the inventor of American banking put aside his duties as colonel of artillery to slice up a half dozen Hessians.\n\nColonel Rall, commanding the Germans, certainly took his time getting dressed for work. All those enemy troops storming past his bedroom window don't seem to have distracted him from getting his necktie on straight.\n\nBy contrast, Colonel Glover is portrayed as somewhat of a fashion emergency. And at the pivotal conference prior to the Battle of Trenton, he makes a scattered, rambling, speech on wig etiquette.\n\nAmong the hardships suffered by the Continental Army's rank-and-file, a shortage of pipe tobacco appears to be a close runner-up to the shoe shortage: They're reduced to toking up cornsilk.\n\nBookseller turned ballistics expert Henry Knox is relegated to comic relief, a sort of Oliver Hardy in period costume.\n\nAnd those poor Hessians can't seem to escape the slur that they were hung-over on duty. Not much truth to this, ditto for the \"mercenary\" label these hapless losers can't seem to shake. When it comes down to it, they were shanghaied. But never mind, movies are about entertainment. Whoever choreographed their antics must have had a sense of humor: With those outlandish uniforms, they pass for Keystone Cops. And the extras really seem to enjoy hamming it up.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of loopy dialogue and low-budget props, I did manage to score a few laughs. But wait. Something was missing. This film was shot up in Canada. So why isn't there any snow and ice? Wasn't that the whole thing about Trenton?

{"text": "\"Easy Rider\" (1969)\n\"A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it\", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.\nSure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.\nThe performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous \"man's\" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he \"sees\" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better.\nThere was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about \"freedom\" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.\nSo, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a \"classic\" could be so banal and stupid.\nMY GRADE: C-", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've always had very mixed feelings about Blue Thunder.  On the plus side it features it features one of the last big budget Hollywood leading roles for the perennially under-appreciated Roy Scheider plus wonderful supporting turns by Warren Oats as his exasperated boss and Candy Clark as his flaky but brave girlfriend and a hissable villain in Malcolm MdDowell.  The movie is fast paced and sometimes exciting and is slickly directed by the underrated John Badham.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nBlue Thunder just has so many things in it that don't ring true it can be frustrating to watch unless you are dumb or willing to turn your brain completely off.  First of all the plot involves a conspiracy by shady government officials and firearms manufacturers to create phony crime to justify the police buying the helicopter of the title--but it's pretty hard to imagine any scenario where a city would allow a heavily armed military chopper that can take out whole city blocks at a time to be used by the police.  Then there's the question of how the very British Malcolm McDowell who never attempts an American accent became a colonel in the US military.  Or how the US military is getting involved with domestic policing even though that is illegal.  Or why the chief assassin for the arms merchants drives around in a beater without any plates that makes him look extremely out of place in all of the upscale areas where he happens to be plying his trade in the movie.\n\nThe sequence where Roy Scheider outsmarts two F-16's and their heat seeking missiles is fun but, realistically, a lot of innocent people likely died as a result of Roy Scheider's evasive maneuvers since this is all happening in the middle of the day when the buildings would be full of people.  The script is co-written by the normally reliable Dan O'Bannon (Alien; Dead and Buried; Return of the Living Dead; Total Recall) so it's hard to understand why Blue Thunder is frequently so dumb.\n\nIn the end Blue Thunder isn't a 1980's action classic in the same league as Die Hard or Robocop or Predator or The Terminator because there are way too many obvious and fixable problems with the script--but on balance it's probably more good than bad and qualifies as reasonably good mindless entertainment, basically a slicker and much more expensive version of the entertaining but dopey schlock that Cannon was churning out.  The frustrating thing is that Blue Thunder could have been excellent if someone had bothered to rewrite the script.", "label": 2}

{"text": "\"The Grudge\" is the American remake of Japan's \"Ju-On: The Grudge\", and while it's nowhere near on par with remakes like \"Dark Water\", \"The Ring\" or \"The Ring Two\", it does stand pretty well on its own.  In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two \"Dark Water\"s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), \"The Grudge\" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of \"Ju-On\", bringing little new to the table.\n\n  As with the original, \"The Grudge\" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the \"Ju-On\" and \"Grudge\" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.\n\n  At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about \"Ju-On\" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.\n\n  \"The Grudge\" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as \"Ju-On\", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see \"Ju-On: The Curse 1\" and \"Ju-On: The Curse 2\", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).\n\n  The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in \"Ju-On\" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here \"The Grudge\" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.\n\n  If one was just going on \"The Grudge\" and \"Ju-On\" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both \"Grudge\" and Ju-On\", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.", "label": 2}

{"text": "\"Taxi Driver\" is a character study more than a story. I can believe that Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay in a fever dream while living in his car: it's mostly about a state of mind, the main character's loneliness and rage. All the other plot details were probably added after the fact. Complementing the script, Robert De Niro buries himself in the part more than in any other film of his career.\n\nThe film frequently feels nervewracking because of how deeply it sees into the protagonist's mind. A few words into De Niro's \"Listen up, you screw-heads\" speech, there is a curious jump-cut and the speech starts over from the beginning. But it's not some avant-garde film device, it's pure reality -- for someone like Travis Bickle, every internal monologue is a rehearsal, he is always imagining himself as an action hero, always playing a scene out in his head, thinking of cooler versions of his \"lines\" and revising them in mid-delivery. The famous \"you're talking to me?\" line is actually part of a long series of threats that Travis makes to an invisible enemy while posing in front of a mirror with his guns.\n\nIn his isolation, Travis can only function in his rare social interactions by relying on cues from previous events. For example, he asks the arms dealer for a specific type of gun, but he first learned the name of that gun only a few days ago when it was mentioned by one of his clients. This completely random event allows him to appear knowledgeable about guns, but really he knows nothing about the type (and ends up buying all of them). Psychologically, this is a fine nuance, one of the things that shows how well the film-makers feel their character. It also contradicts the formal plot of the film -- as a war veteran, wouldn't Travis have picked up some information about firearms? (More importantly, wouldn't he at least have picked up rudimentary conversational skills from the guys in his platoon?)\n\nBut the film-makers don't care about that. According to them, the Vietnam backstory was meant to highlight Travis' alienation from society, and I suspect they just didn't bother to think through plot consistency. For years, viewers have debated whether the ending (in which, ironically, Travis is hailed as a hero) was meant to be \"real,\" or whether it only took place in Travis' head. But you might as well ask that question much earlier. Did the entire shoot-out ever really take place, or was it just part of Travis' action-hero fantasy? Did he really try to assassinate Palantine, or did he just fantasize about it, and then \"revise\" his fantasy to follow the more \"romantic\" storyline of rescuing the girl from the pimps? Did he really shoot the robber in the store? Was he ever even in Vietnam? If he self-importantly tells people that he's \"doing some work for the government,\" why couldn't he make up a Vietnam background? Was his exercise regimen real, or did he just imagine himself holding his hand out over the gas burner? As many critics have pointed out, nearly every scene is told from Travis' point of view, so potentially any scene after the failed date could be the film's last moment of \"reality.\"\n\nIt is intellectually interesting to think about things like that, but unfortunately it is also a weakness of the film. The film-makers had a character, but ultimately they didn't know what to do with him or say about him, or how to end their movie. The film is a perceptive profile of a psychological type that could easily snap and become a loose cannon. But where did he come from, how did he get this way? The film's only explanation is Vietnam, but we have seen many Travis-like characters on the news in recent years, and usually they are not veterans. And, more importantly, is there anything that should or could be done to reach out to people like Travis? Was there ever any way to help him? The ending side-steps this question with some stylized violence, and then glibly criticizes media sensationalism (for you see, they would have condemned Travis for shooting Palantine, but they praise him for slaughtering a bunch of criminals). It's hard to argue with that, but it's also pretty obvious, and doesn't shed any useful light on the main issue.", "label": 2}

The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. \"Resident Evil\" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in \"Twelve Monkeys\" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, \"I am Legend\" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema.

This movie, while being spicy and sorta on the verge, was not what I expected.  When I saw it in theathers I though it was a really good movie.  So good that I ACTURALLY bought the movie on VHS and then updated to DVD.  I watched it on VHS and it was okay but when I popped in the DVD ... it lost it's magic.  First off ... a few things where wrong with the dvd.\n1.) Quality - The picture was great.  Clear and perfect.  The only problem with the picture was it was too dark to even see who was who.\n2.)  Music - Couldn't they had put more felling into the music and acturally, I don't know, sing for once.  I know you lip-sing in music videos but, if you really want to get the crowd going and yelling for a sequel or another Spice movie, just sing and don't be scared and stupid as lets say, Britney Spears is.\n3.)  Special Feautures - There were only 2 special features on the disc at all.  People usually upgrade to DVD's for the special features.  Am I right??  Of course I Am!\nThis movie, while being sporty and spicy, this is not a movie I would recommend you upgrade to DVD.  If you have the VHS ... keep it.  Don't upgrade to the DVD. Your just wasting your money!  Read my other DVD reviews and listen to my advice.  It's the best on this website!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles, holy jesus it's awful. You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.\n\nReally it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. \"Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!\".\n\nAlso in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.\n\nSo eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, \"oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond\" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.\n\nSo much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.\n\nThen later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.\n\nSo OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience \"hey I'm still here\", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS!

{"text": "Moderately paced jazz is the music of love for the romantic comedy Roxanne, based loosely on the famous Edmond Rostand play Cyrano de Bergerac. The story itself is a timeless tale of love hindered by a colossally appalling facial feature, but screenwriter Steve Martin shakes things up a bit with generous amounts of whimsical comedy. At times it's too much, going almost as over-the-top as his Pink Panther films, themselves merely a vehicle for a one-laugh Frenchman impression. In Roxanne, he seems to channel the overacting of Jim Carrey, taking the already unbelievably Pinnochio-faced lead character in a direction of total poppycock. Unfortunately most of the humor falls flat.\n\nCharles D. Bales (Steve Martin) is a fire chief in the small town of Nelson and a hopeless romantic, poetic and kind, but plagued by an inescapably large nose. When he meets Roxanne Kowalski (Daryl Hannah), a stunningly beautiful astronomer (or so the other actors must pretend), he immediately falls in love. She's everything he could want in a woman, but she sees him only as a friend, instead infatuated with the muscular new fireman Chris McConnell (Rick Rossovich) who recently joined Charlie's team.\n\nAlthough he too wishes to see more of Roxanne, Chris lacks confidence with women, and is reduced to a clumsy mess in their presence. Given the opportunity to convey his true feelings for Roxanne, Charlie agrees to write a letter to her for Chris. When his lyrical wordsmanship instantaneously seduces Roxanne, Charlie finds himself continuing to woo her for the benefit of his competition. But how can she love him for who he is when he has such a hideously humongous nose?\n\nWhere Cyrano fought with a sword, Charlie fights with a tennis racket against golf clubs. Although he commands an incredibly inept anti-Backdraft fire department, he excels at physical and verbal jousting, the former contributing to much of the cheesiness of the plot, while the latter accounts for the few genuine laughs. Oddly enough, the explanation for why Charlie won't simply get a nose job is more believable than his noble intentions for continuing to sweep his dream girl off her feet and into the arms of a scatterbrained hunk. Roxanne tragically and carelessly teeters on the border of harmless romantic comedy and eye-gouging filmic nonsense, making it less than appealing for viewers not infatuated with Martin's brand of comedy. Longtime fans, however, may see this film as a highlight.\n\n- Mike Massie", "label": 2}
{"text": "Well, after just finished watching this rather, er, unusual video, I can finally give my honest opinion. First of all, I can agree with many others that the historical accuracy left something to be desired seeing as how  much of today's generation seems to take historical movies as the whole  truth and nothing but the truth.  As for the acting, I found her to be  rather, shall we say, odd? As I stared at her I couldn't help myself wonder  if she was about to scream in rage and burst into flames. It would make  someone wonder if she was sane of mind. In my opinion, the actress who  played Joan of Arc made her appear to be a religeous nut case and a  complete lunatic.  And as far as the comment one of the other reviewers  made saying only a \"...religeous fanatic...Pat Robertson.\" would  ever buy this video, I can't help perhaps think the contrary. I was rather  disturbed seeing Christ protrayed as a rather frightening man with almost  lunatic seeming eyes and an expression of one about to be executed.  In any  case, presenting all these down sides, I can at least say that at least the  movie had some good special effects and recreating some of those moments  were good. I'd comment on the good acting if it wasn't downright unnerving  watching it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've played every Resident Evil game and book there is and I have to say what the heck is this movie about?  I mean if you're going to call it Resident Evil you might want it to look and be as close to the game as you can.  When I heard the movie was coming out I couldn't wait to see it...but now that I have I wished I didn't.  The script was terrible; it took away from the whole resident evil series.  Originally the whole plot was Umbrella Corporation was creating genetically engineered B.O.W. Weapons.\nFrom the start things were terribly wrong.  The mansion (if you could call it that) wasn't even what it looked like in any of the games and the hive what the hell was that???  Both the mansion and Raccoon City had its own underground labs. And the Red Queen what the hell where they thinking?  That took away from what could be expected to be a great screen play of the popular Resident Evil games.  R.E. gamers expect if you have zombies and the other nasty creations where is the scientists who created them?  The scientist in the movie look like college graduates rather than medical geniuses who would research on something like the T-Virus.\nThere was no mention of S.T.A.R.S. the G-Virus or even William Birkin, who was the man who created the T-Virus. That would have made this movie more worth while to see. It would also have cleared a lot of things up and made the movie sell more.  The zombies both portrayed what they did in the game because they weren't all messed up because they don't decay fast.  I thought that the licker and the zombie dogs were also a really good touch.  But the movie would have been better if there were a little bit more monsters like hunters, zombie crows, and the infamous Tyrant.  They would have made this a better movie.\nThe acting was good considering the bad script.  Actresses Milla Jovovich (Alice) and Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocamo) did really well.  The scripting and design on the laser room scene was bad.  The whole team could have just stayed but the front or back doors where the laser beam couldn't hit them (because the glass wall didn't extend to the doors) would have been a smart move. But instead you have 3 butchered commandos and one diced leader.\nIn all, this movie to Resident Evil gamers is a partial upset.  And its replay life is only a couple of times.  But for all you suspense/horror movies this one is your movie.  It contains many thrilling parts including zombie carnage, action packed gun battles, navigating through a dark murky sewer, and a high speed train slug match between the living and undead.  This is an especially good zombie movie even though it isn't as gory as some but the suspense is what makes it a good movie.\nAlthough this movie had a lot of changes and upsets it is still a good movie.  The movie also left off at a good spot where the other one could pick up on.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is an exceptional series.  Kudos to Zondervan and Matt Williams.\n\nWe selected this series for our new small group.  My wife and I have been involved in multiple small groups for the past thirty years.  I have often found small group material shallow and unchallenging.  Everyone in our group finds this series exceptional on multiple levels.  First, the quality of the material is superb because each lesson is taught by seminary professor who is speaking in his area of expertise.  Second, the format of splitting each video lesson into three parts is very effective.  I was weary of this before we started, wondering how it would logistically work in the group, and how the whole thing would flow.  However, we have found that it works very well, allowing you to discuss the points of each sub-teaching before going on to the next section that builds upon the prior one: Historical context, deeper dive into the meaning, and application.  You just have to be disciplined to keep on schedule.  Third, the personal application (focus of the third video section) and the attending questions are focused, deep, and easily personalized.  Fourth, I have found powerful little nuggets of truth in text boxes inserted in the study guide of each lesson.\n\nWe relocated to South Carolina in May 2012 and we're new to the church we're attending.  I have to say, this new small group is the deepest, most mature small group we have ever been a part of as a couple.  Although our group is very mature, I don't at all think this material is only suitable for more mature, deeply committed followers of Jesus.  Its value is not that it is intellectually deep and challenging, but rather that its deep insights are so well developed, well presented, and easily understood.  I think this material will be equally beneficial to anyone willing to sit and participate - from questioning seekers to mature followers of Jesus.\n\nTo A.I. who tossed out the entire series based on dislike for the directors decision to have the speakers not look into the camera as they presented: an epic tossing of the baby with the bath water.\n\nOur group has decided to continue with the Deeper Connection series after this one.", "label": 1}

He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.\nAlso, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it.\nOverall, this is not an awful movie.

{"text": "THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.

{"text": "This Ddvd set is deffective.  I should have read the reviews and not purchased it.  The first CD doesnt work at all.  You cant watch the shows because they pause and freeze. The first show doesnt play at ALL.  The second plays some, then pauses and freezes.  You cant restart it or forward thru a frozen part.  You cant advance to the next chapter either.  Its just frozen.  The 3rd show ( last show on first disk ) also froze within the first minute.  If you let it sit and try to wait it out to see if it will continue playing and jump past the freeze, it does, only to a different chapter and is still frozen.  No voices at all on the 3rd episode either ( probably because its frozen the whole time )  The whole first disk is garbage and unwatchable.  The whole first season is frozen. ( that would be the first 12 dvds ) As far as the next 4 seasons ... i haven't got that far yet, but it appears the whole thing is garbage.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!  SO far out of 12 dvds, i haven't seen one episode!!!!!  Save your money.  I am so dissapointed i wasted my money on this.  BUYER BEWARE on this one!!!!!", "label": 0}

Norman grew up in a traditional household, with a father as the head of the household and breadwinner and family's moral compass, the mother as the homemaker, and their two sons. It is around this time period where childhood also leaves the notion of children being economic assets behind, and instead begins to focus on emotional childhoods based on social class and the resources the family had. Throughout the movie, you can see both Norman and Paul rebelling against their father as the head of the household and his spiritual leadership - Norman leaves Montana to go to college, while Paul turns to drinking and alcohol.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Fun flick, but one minor complaint...\nI am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, but enjoy them quite a bit.  I understand the \"rules\" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  I can say the same about Romantic Comedies, Documentaries and Action Adventure flicks.  When they're done well I enjoy the heck out of them.\nThat having been said, Resident Evil compares favorably among it's fellows.  I'm not going to discuss plot because there are a few hundred reviews posted here on Amazon that explain pretty much everything.  Besides, you really don't want me to ruin it, do you?\nThere is more action than gore, but it's pretty graphic action so Argento freaks may not walk away happy but the rest of us will have a good time.  There is an Aliens type feel to the elite military team, but the characters are very broadly sketched and there's not a lot of feeling for them as they fall victim to the beasts and nasties that inhabit the lair beneath the mansion.  Still, seeing a few hundred zombies ganging up on five or six well trained commandoes makes up for the lack of characterization.\nAs far as the effects go, my only complaint is the CGI work on the most monstrous of the beasties.  The concept was excellent, but the execution left a bit to be desired.  Resident Evil is based on a computer game and the monster looked like he was lifted right off a Playstation and dropped onto the set.  I actually chuckled at one point when he was climbing up a wall and looking over his shoulder.  My finger automatically sought out a fire button to waste his sorry behind.\nAll that having been said I do have one major complaint about this flick.  Are we supposed to believe that these folks live in a world where there has not been a single zombie movie ever made?  Reanimated dead folks, shambling through corridors trying to eat human flesh and none of these crack commandoes have the presence of mind to try a head shot?  I know with small arms it's advisable to shoot for the center of the target, but how many rounds do you put into something's chest before you try another target?  It's a small complaint, I know, but just once I wish a character in one of these movies would have seen a Romero movie some time in their life.\nLong and short of it; decent effects save one CGI character, a decent plot and wall to wall zombie killing action...  I can think of worse ways to spend a Saturday night.", "label": 2}

[1970] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] The Original Christmas Classic!\n\nFor the first time on Blu-ray, rediscover the magic of Santa Claus in the Original Christmas Classic!\n\nDo you remember when the Burgermeister Meisterburger banned toys, and Kris Kringle became Santa Claus? Share the magic of this original Christmas classic told and sung by Fred Astaire! Narrated by Fred Astaire.\n\nVoice Cast: Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, Paul Frees, Joan Gardner, Robie Lester, Andrea Sacino, Dina Lynn, Gary White, Greg Thomas and The Westminster Childrens Choir (Final Chorus)\n\nDirectors: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nProducers: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nScreenplay: Romeo Muller\n\nComposer: Jules Bass and Maury Laws\n\nVideo Resolution: 1080p\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 [4:3]\n\nAudio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nRunning Time: 48:40 minutes\n\nRegion: Region B/2\n\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nStudio: ClassicMedia / Studio: Universal Pictures UK\n\nAndrew's Blu-ray Review: `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was originally a 1970 stop motion television special, made by Rankin-Bass. The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThe special was created using stop motion animation called \"Animagic,\" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).\n\n`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.\n\nWhereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.\n\nFor over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:\n\nSadly none has been provided.\n\nFinally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!\n\nAndrew C.

The actors do their best to interact with the obviously bland and remarkably unoriginal plot, and the special effects make for some excellent scenes.\nThe movie is cohesive in the respect that I saw how the writers didn't make the fatal mistake of taking the famous game plot and drive it into a movie, they used the names of a few key events and objects (Umbrella, T-Virus, Raccoon City) and rebuilt the movie to fit into two hours of action that didn't require puzzle solving and boring backtracking (though you see in the movie less than thirty different scenes I think!)\nThe movie is a good fling for some entertainment (but if your a gamer, don't expect Jill or Chris to blow anything away!) The movie made its mark as yet another video game-movie transfer and it ranks, like its previous attempts, mediocre. I think that the game to movie idea needs some more time to develop, after all the average video game lasts three to sixty hours now, so movies are a bit pressed for a descant transfer!", "label": 2}

I found Libya on the map. They seemed like some onery folk at the time. I was ready to drop some hellfire on them 'camel jockeys'.\nBut I could never get a hold of an F-16.\nBut judging by some of the reviews here, some lucky peepsqueaks DID manage to get F-16's. So many youths cite this piece of dreck as the reason they joined the airforce and are now doing the will of a commander-in-chief who probably goes back to his ranch, closes the door, and puts the 'Iron Eagle' DVD on!!\nUltimate boys movie indeed.\nThis doesn't change the fact that 'Iron Eagle' is unabashedly racist. It was mostly filmed in Israel with the IDF and Israeli government providing all the fighter jets AND pilots along with the scenery. All they asked for in return was that the villains be (nameless, faceless, dehumanized) 'Arabs' from a fictional (generic) Arab 'terrorist country'. This demonization of an entire people was (and is) an Israeli government PR campaign to get the American public to see the 'plight of the Jewish people' as they 'struggle' against the 'evil Arab terrorists'.\nI would hope the producers of 'Iron Eagle' were duped into going along with this. Because other than that, it is a pretty fine movie. Unlike a lot of 80's action-movie dreck, 'Iron Eagle' actually has likeable characters. Louis Gosset Jr. delivers a fine performance as the 'tough but fair' Colonel 'Chappy' Sinclaire. The action sequences rival and sometimes better the ones in 'Top Gun'. Plus, there is no sappy romance sub-plot to drag this puppy down. This movie is purely a boys film.\nSo if you can turn your brain (and your conscience) off for an hour and 20 minutes, get a hold of 'Iron Eagle'. But watch out for the sequels. They're bad.

{"text": "Alright, so Resident Evil has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad characterization and bad plot development. How can this possibly be any good? It's simple; you forget all the above because it's just so much fun. Of course I love zombie movies, so I could be a little biased.\nIncorporating elements of the original video game into the storyline, the plot of a S.W.A.T-type team and a couple of amnesiacs stuck in a secret underground lab where genetic experiments have gone awry is for the most part intriguing and entertaining. Good enough to keep your interest for the duration of the film, at least. The development and timing of the plot needed some work; some things were revealed too late, some too soon, but the film's energy distracts you from dwelling on that too much. And except for a few clever scenes, there isn't much to admire aesthetically, but who goes to zombie movies to enjoy a piece of art?\nAlthough it borrows too much from other genre films, such as Aliens, Cube, and George Romero's Living Dead movies, Resident Evil somehow manages to still make it work. No, it doesn't come close to the greatness of Romero's films or the gore fest of Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (a.k.a. Brain dead), but it is still much better then many other zombie flicks.\nSo if you're just looking for a fun zombie flick with plenty of action, Resident Evil's got what you want.

No credibility, no presence, no strength.  Arguably his worst performance to date.\nThe retro-look is too glib, and a sense of humour sorely lacking. The film tries VERY hard to be surrealistic (with the Baddies dressing up as teddybears and not-quite-but-almost Bond-like gadgets) but everything the desperate producers throw at us is hollow (You can almost hear them pleading with the audience: \"Now THIS is really funny and weird?

The start was well contrived, leading the watchers to feel for the soon-to-be-killed employees of the Umbrella corporation.\nIt falls rapidly downhill from there. Somehow, directors seem to get a thrill in having leading star Milla Jovovich naked when we first see her and when we leave her (think Fifth Element). It wasn't much of an acting challenge for Jovovich, just a few looks here and there, and a number of well-placed kicks. The supporting actors were not much better. Michelle Rodriguez, known better as Lennie in The Fast and the Furious, puts on an act not unlike Velazques in Aliens.\nHighlights include the laser killing techniques that bring to mind the opening sequence of alternative movie Cube, which used thin wires for the same effect, the death sequences, the alarming jump that one gets when a former employee reanimates for the first time, and the startling eery super-computer, the Red Queen, which in my opinion was the best character of the lot.\nEven the casting of dancers as the zombies was a good idea, making their movements realistic.\nBut the whole story had a lot of flaws. The explaination of the zombies was extremely inaccurate and unbelievable, as well as their following of our 'heros'.\nAs a business student too, the actions of the Umbrella Corporation after the Hive was sealed and the survivors rescued was extremely inaccurate. But I won't get into that.\nApart from the small highlights, the movie was extremely poor. Only watch it if you are a die-hard fan, or like getting kicks from extreme gore.", "label": 0}

But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style.\nIt feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?\nIt's fun to hear the \"alien theme\" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?  He's so often gone with unknowns or unusual choices and we've usually been SO pleasantly surprised).\nI don't want to dwell on this too much, but CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a piece of movie history, but sadly, not a living, breathing one.", "label": 0}

Her films (when she has a starring role and holds all of the cards) are long, drawn-out pieces that have the tendency to mystify an audience.  \"Prince\" is no exception.\n\nSo many unnecessary scenes flog us, beat us up, wear us down.  But it's Barbra.  There is NO connection between her and Nick Nolte, his last good role beofre the DUI and the mug shot heard 'round the world.  He's good enough, but my god I want to slap him in the face for going through all of this soap opera turmoil regarding his twin sister and toying with the idea of leaving his wife and children....\n\nfor Barbra.\n\nShe screams, she jolts around, she sighs, she moves.  She's supposed to be beautiful, and while she is no classic beauty (was Norma Shearer?) she at least has the decency to photograph and light herself well.  Sometimes too well.\n\nThe casting of George Carlin as the gay neighbor is way off base.  First, he isn't gay (in his personal life) and second, he is over-the-top gay and not so very funny for having been encouraged to act that way.  I'm surprised that Sreisand, ever the perfectionist, would have allowed this.\n\nIt's a long film, like all Streisand STREISAND films.  She's the star, we bought the ticket, and we'd better sit down, shut up, watch it, and to hell with the popcorn.

{"text": "This movie has been thouroughly torpedoed by critics and audiences alike - fuelled, no doubt, by the severe lashings Mr. Connery himself doled out during post-production. But while there's plenty reason to dislike it (a plot petering out in an insipid ending, misuse of Mr. Fiennes' acting qualities, discontinuities in the filming, etc etc), there's even more to enjoy, in a camp sort of way.\nThe scene with Connery in teddybear-disguise is a hilarious spoof of James Bond's Spectre-meetings, some of the Dali-esque setpieces are intruiging and in general the whole film is so outrageously ridiculous that you won't gain anything by missing it, to say the least. Comparisons with the original, authentic, masterly Avengers-tv-series (with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg) shouldn't be made - the film doesn't stand up to it and if it purports to do so, it's its major weakness.

{"text": "One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.\nYou can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift.

{"text": "I still don't understand why everybody seems to love Air Force One so much.  First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.

You play it locked up in your room in the dead of night and find yourself transported to a place that shocks you.  Every noise makes your heart jump.  That is the exact feeling I wanted from this movie.  `Resident Evil' is not an action/adventure type game.  It is a dark and slowly paced horror game.  That is what this movie needed to be.  It needed to layer on the fear and tension, not the action.  Sure, it's cool to see Milla Jovovich kick some serious zombie butt, but I'd rather have seen her hyperventilate in a dark room while she listened to the corpses dragging their broken limbs across the hall on the other side of the door.\n\nIt's my opinion, but I think it is what the videogame warranted.\n\nTaking my personal preference aside, this movie does deliver to a certain extent.  The story it develops is engaging (and the back story does have a certain amount of depth) and they tried hard to layer it with elements from the film, but overall it feels a tad hollow or unimportant.  When it's all over you don't feel like you need to watch it again.  There are far better zombie films out there (Danny Boyle's masterpiece '28 Days Later' is everything this film SHOULD have been).\n\nJovovich is a stunning piece of eye candy, and I really enjoy watching her breathe, so I was game for this film and its ridiculous sequels.

{"text": "**Warning: Minor spoilers ahead**\n\nHonestly.  What can I say about this movie?  If you've seen the trailers for Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or have seen the first Resident Evil movie, then you know what kind of movie you're in for.  Anyone expecting a deep storyline (although I think most movie goers are smart enough not to expect one) would be advised to look elsewhere.  Apocalypse is a B-movie through and through.  It's heavy on fight scenes with gun-fighting, explosions, blood splattering, and limbs being broken every minute, with plot and dialogue taking a back seat.\n\nApocalypse's story is pretty standard fare.  It takes place soon after the events of the first Resident Evil movie.  A virus has spread through Raccoon City, turning its inhabitants into flesh eating zombies.  Those who have not yet been infected (i.e. the main characters in the movie) have to find a way out of the city while surviving the onrush of a zombie horde, and a super-zombie called the Nemesis.  In most B-level zombie movies you wouldn't expect the acting to be all that great...and this movie is no exception.  I don't blame the actors however.  Milla Jovovich (who plays Alice) and the rest of the cast try to make the best of the movie's stilted dialogue with varying degrees of success.\n\nHowever, my main problem with the movie is that the plot is not much more than a string of `money shot' sequences that make no real sense.  One prime example of this is during the fight at the church.  Jovovich's character smashes through a stain glass window on a motorcycle and saves the lives of the humans inside.  A few problems with that whole sequence include: 1) How did she know what was going on inside the church?  2) How did she know exactly where to land?  3) Why didn't she just go through the front door?  Apocalypse is filled with many horror movie clichs (i.e. going into a dark room alone in a zombie infested building) where you know someone is going to die.  Also, there was one scene where Alice and the gang walk through a graveyard to try and escape the zombies.  Of all the places you could go to hide from the walking-dead, why in the world would you go into a graveyard?!  Now, you're probably asking why the heck I would expect a coherent story in a zombie movie?  Because it has been done before.  Movies like 28 Days Later have shown that zombie movies could have strong dialogue, character development, and a good plot.\n\nThe one bright spot in this movie is that if you want to see a ton of zombies get shot up, than Resident Evil: Apocalypse delivers in spades.  The action Apocalypse is non-stop, especially when the Nemesis shows up.  Speaking of the Nemesis, I can't help but like the design of Nemesis' costume, and seeing him blow up everything with his rocket launcher and chain gun was pretty darn cool.\n\nThe fact is, if you liked the first Resident Evil, than you will definitely like Apocalypse (and I should note that the ending leaves room for another sequel).  Personally, I thought that Apocalypse was actually better than the first movie, but frankly that's not saying much.  If you want to see a good zombie movie, I suggest you check out 28 Days Later, or Dawn of the Dead (either the 1978 or 2004 version which I have not yet seen, but I hear is quite good), and wait for Resident Evil: Apocalypse to come to DVD and rent it instead.\n\nI give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Rochester has been one of my all time favorite heroes. Jane Eyre one of my all time favorite books and heroines. I read it almost yearly.\nI am a fan of Ciaran Hinds (believe it or not). After seeing him in Ivanhoe, where he brought such a wonderful wounded, smokey edge to Gilbert, I remarked to a friend of mine, \"wouldn't he just be the penultimate Rochester?\" I was thrilled to find out shortly thereafter that this was going to be the case. Wow!!! I couldn't wait to see it.\nAnd then I did.\nWhat were the director and the scriptwriters thinking? After such a subtle moving proformance in Ivanhoe, Mr Hinds turns Rochester into a strutting, bellowing, obnoxious bully. Eu[...] Our Jane would NOT want this jerk. I was embarressed for him! Not to mention disappointed and sad for such a missed opportunity with this production.\nThe actress who played Jane did it passably well but still no great shakes.\nAnd *where* did the writers get this dialogue?

{"text": "First off, I thought this movie was okay. The acting was fine, and the pace of the story kept it from dragging too much. However, the basic idea is, well...stupid. According to the movie, Japan has a superstition that anyone who is murdered and dies in a way that involves great anger or sorrow (which should cover most deaths) ends up killing everyone who enters the house the death occurred in. If this were actually possible, I have to assume the Japanese government/police would have grown wise to this and torn down houses like the one this story focuses on. If you can accept that no one would ever catch on to this bit of the obvious in Japan, then the movie is enjoyable, to a point. This is one of those \"jigsaw\" movies that unfold out of chronological order, so you have to pay attention to the entire second half to understand why this particular story is the one being told. If they make a sequel, I hope they address some of the unanswered questions from this movie. (For instance, is the grudge so strong that the ghost(s) would follow someone back to America? Is there a time limit to how long you have to be in the house to justify being killed, like a plumber addressing a leaky toilet?) The mystery continues...", "label": 2}

{"text": "Having seen \"The Grudge\" in its \"theatrical release,\" I immediately played this DVD with the overlapping \"commentary\" feature because I wanted to hear the participants' input.  Towards the end, Sam Raimi reveals that a \"director's cut\" may/will be released a couple of months after this initial release.  That not-here version will apparently include 3 more minutes of horror, shock, and gore, but will delete the rooftop scene in which the main detective explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar's character the mystical/spiritual basis for what's happening.  We are told that the detective's explanation, which isn't all that complicated or helpful anyway, would be superfluous to the Japanese audience, which is (say the cast and crew) already accustomed to...well, actually I wonder.  Am I to understand that EVERYONE in Japan expects that when an awful murder happens in a house, future residents should expect to be killed by their ghosts?  No wonder the realtor in this movie kept quiet about the dysfunctional bathtub.\n\nAnyway, if you're wild about this movie you may want to hold out for a couple of months before buying this version.  I went for a certain national chain's promotion and got this DVD along with the Japanese version, \"Ju-On,\" as a package deal.  I haven't watched that yet, but Sam, Sarah, and company said that the rooftop scene isn't in \"Ju-On\" either.\n\nClearly I also disagree with Roger Ebert's one-star lambasting of \"The Grudge,\" not only because I am a big fan of Ms. Gellar but because I found the pacing, camera shots, sets, and the music appropriately chilling.  For me, the nonsequential depiction of some events effectively built the suspense.  I usually agree with Roger, but I don't understand why he thought the plot didn't tie together.  (He also complained about the preponderance of hair dangling throughout the movie.  That gave me something else to watch for, a little inside joke with myself while the rest of the audience was gasping and screaming.)\n\nIf you can accept the admittedly suspect premise that \"[w]hen someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is left behind\" (it's on the box; I didn't memorize it, whattaya think, I'm a fanatic?)...oh, and you like lots of mysterious ghoulish death, you will enjoy \"The Grudge.\"", "label": 2}

Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a top notch, high octane action film that will definitley please any action film fan. Harrison Ford stars as the President Of The United States whose plane, Air Force One, is taken over in mid-air by russian terrorists. The always excellent Gary Oldman plays the lead villain, and he does it with complete scene stealing bravado. Glenn Close co-stars as the Vice President who tries to communicate with Oldman from Washington D.C. headquarters. We've seen this before, but this is a million times better than most action films that involve hostages and planes. The action is pretty high once it gets going, and the violence is all over the place. Ford is, once again, cinema's leading hero. He can be a space pirate, adventurous professor, or the President. He can make it work every time. Even if the script doesn't always hold up to his excellence. This is one of those.

We were young and I was in the USAF stationed in England during 3 of the years that UPSTAIRS-DOWNSTAIRS aired on live TV and so perhaps that's part of why we love it.\n\nIt's not action-based and it's not comedy-based.

Neither group is villainous but neither group is perfect. They all have their good points and all have their faults but that's what makes it so interesting to watch. And inevitably, what goes on UPSTAIRS or DOWNSTAIRS affects the other group, either directly or indirectly. It's so well done that you may have to pinch yourself to remember that these people are just actors, plus make sure to watch the 25th anniversary show about making of the series.\n\nIn the 1970s the quality of British TV video was superior to the quality of US TV because they used more lines per screen. However, the quality of the audio and video of this product is awful, just awful. It's even poor by low-def standards. It's very grainy and has wavy lines in it at times.

She was really believable in her role and her acting was fantastic. it is really a pity she got put in this version. I have to main objections to the book which you may read here below if you wish.\nMy objections to the books are this: First of all I did not like Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester. I saw him a few months ago in Persuasion and was so Happy in his portrayal of Captain Wentworth. It was not the case with his sad portrayal of Edward Rochester. He seemed to think that Mr Rochester was an very, very, very angry man and nothing more. I never really liked Edward's character but he was a lot more complicated than that. He may be weak and selfish but he is also brooding, moody and passionate. To see a proper portrayal of Rochester. You must refer to the performances of Micheal Jayston, Toby Stephens and Timothy Dalton. Especially Dalton! Ciaran Hinds did nothing but scream all the time. And I never could imagine Mr. Rochester with a mustache.\nSecondly I would have liked the script to be a little closer to the novel. The first half is not that bad but the second is horrid. Nothing is mentioned of Jane inheriting a fortune and one of St John's sister is deleted. And speaking of St John we don't get to know how mesmerizing his character is(And I have definatly seen Rupert Penry-Jones look better). The version was just too short! Jane and Rochester's readmitting their love for each other is shortened into one scene but Morton managed to pull it off quite well. I repeat she is the only cause why I do not give this version one star.\nNeed I say more? Those are the main things I find disagreable but there are several more I could state, but I will not waste my time and I think I have made my points.\nTo conclude if you want to watch this movie so badly go watch it on the internet. If it happens to please you and you wish to see it agin then you may buy it. If you wish to see a truly fantastic version. Then I suggest you buy the 1983 version. If you want to see other ones then also buy the 1973  or the 2006 version. They are definitely better than this one.\nThank you for your time.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I don't get to watch television much, so, it's rare I see any previews for movies. However, a movie being made out of one of Playstation's better games, Resident Evil, shouldn't have evaded me before it was released. I mean, I know that their making new Halloween and new Friday the 13th movies.\nResident Evil is based off of the video game. It has an almost no-name cast, with an exception to Michelle Rodriguez, that you may remember from the Fast and the Furious. It incorporates aspects of the Matrix, in fact one seen where the main star, Milla Jovovich, is battling Zombie Dogs, she runs up a wall and performs nearly verbatim the same move that takes place in scene one from the Matrix. There is even a slow motion bullet scene at the end of the movie. The acting wasn't top notch. In fact, it left a bit to be desired, and the script wasn't done very well either. The only redeeming factor is that it had top notch sound effects and a lot of cool independent scenes. Such as the defense mechanism of lasers that the computer has. That part was cool, but again, it was stolen from another Keanu Reeves film, Johnny Mnemonic. So, the special effects are almost primitive now.\nOverall the movie was good. Worth seeing in the theatre simply for the sound effects. I enjoyed it. I may buy it. There is going to be a sequel. Hopefully it's better.", "label": 2}

It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.\n\nThe first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.\n\nThe film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.\n\nOliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.\n\nWhile the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.\n\nThe animated title sequence is by Richard Williams?

{"text": "Directed by Barbra Streisand, who becomes Nick Nolte's Psychiatrist and eventual love interest, this cardboard cut out of a psychodrama does occasionally manage to rise above the category of dull and contrived. With so many predicable twists in its Freudian laden tropes, little is left to the aware viewer's imagination.\n\nNolte is a Southern divorcee and gentleman to be, running away from a cramped married life made even more miserable by a hidden family past involving a rape and murder, and a sister who mentally did not manage to survive it all. Streisand, using all of her Jewish New York savvy, business charm and a tool kit full of Freudian 101 psychoanalytic techniques, plus a predictable bad marriage, manages to both seduce and cure her handsome troubled Southern client. And in the process he is able to help his sister return her life to a semblance of sanity and normalcy.\n\nAlthough the acting is much better than the script, which is thin, with a plot packed full of painfully predictable mini-Freudian psychodramas, it is nevertheless and interesting movie. Nolte at least gets to stretch his acting skills out well beyond the normal \"silent hard-drinking tough guy\" roles he is so used to. Three Stars", "label": 2}

Different themes in the film - freedom, prejudice, community, and hypocrisy - are tossed around aimlessly, with no sense of cohesion, making the viewer wonder just what the film's point is (when he isn't yawning).

It's possibly worth checking out for that fact alone, Owen especially looks different to his later self in movies, you've likely have seen.  The film was written by Owen along with Wes Anderson.  There isn't really much of a storyline though, basically the two brothers play best (or only) friends, Luke's character has been in a mental hospital, but he's clearly the more level headed of the two.  Owen's character wants to impress his former boss (James Caan, who he doesn't mention at first employed him as a landscaper), by robbing a from what I could tell public library.  There's no ingenious plan or anything, it just happens at one point in the film, and it's not that exciting.  Their getaway driver a rich kid, is constantly being bullied and beat up by his older brother.  They decide to lay low at a cheap isolated motor inn where their driver leaves to deal with his brother's demands.  So hence they are stuck there.  Luke's character becomes infatuated with a housekeeping woman who doesn't speak English, the only language he does while Owen's just sets off fire works and mopes around the place.  There's plenty of opportunities for humour with all the above scenarios but for some reason they didn't go there. In fact there really aren't any laughs in the film at all, the characters all act oddly the whole film but that's it, and that just makes the movie seem unrealistic.\n\nIf you're a huge Wes Anderson, or of either of the Owen brothers you might want to check Bottle Rocket out just so you can say you've seen everything they've been in/written, but if you're not, you're probably only going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty slow, boring and pointless film.  Could even have been something they were making for a university class or something.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Movie 6 of 1976 and 37 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.\n\nI have had my eyes on this one for years. In fact so many 70's films exceeded my expectations that I wanted to buy it before I started 1976 to ensure it didn't go under the radar. I'm not disappointed with \"Taxi Driver\" it is precisely what I expected. I think what happened is over the years no one could give me a good reason to watch it. They just said it was great. All the effusive accolades amounted to vapid emotion to me. I want well thought out reasons why a movie is supposed to be good. I don't care who's in it, who directed it, or likes it, no movie gets a pass. If you aren't good then I'm going to say so and \"Taxi Driver\" is not good. It's boring and unfocused.\nFirst and foremost was the daunting burden of having to listen to that droning music for two hours. I don't care if the point was to task us with the mind set of Bickle or not that was just atrocious! It was the musical equivalent to having a pebble stuck in your shoe as you walk: it's there nagging you about how crappy it is and you can't get rid of it and it does nothing other than be crappy and annoying. Completely ruined the movie for me. Now according to the composer it was a reflection of the main character's thoughts and mind set. Well there is an evolution of thought so why did the music remain static? I don't care about the great movies Herrmann had done before,  he did an awful job. It lacked creativity to me. I know the guy is in a cab all night long,  alone, night after night, so what? Is that worthy of any music that would reflect it? How about music that hints at the tedium without being tedious? I understand that Scorsese could have perhaps chosen other songs, I don't really care, just a mess in my opinion.\n\"Taxi Driver\" lacked focus. There was an interesting glimmer of thought where Bickle would judge those who might have been upstanding (Shepard) and worked to redeem those whom might have been considered \"scum.\" I also liked the idea that there is a thin line between hero and villain that plays out. It was just too long of a meandering journey to get there.\nOne of Scorsese's biggest strengths needs to be tempered. He is incredibly aware of the camera's effect on the audience. The way we see only DeNiro's torso then the camera springs up suddenly to his head to reveal his Mohawk was jarring and very well done. The violence at the end was incredibly effective, I was jaw dropped. It couldn't save the story for me though and I wondered if this was a crutch for an otherwise bland ending. I do think the theme of hero/villain was movie worthy, that is to say there was a good point to the story but it just wasn't enough for me.\nIn the end I think \"Taxi Driver\" was just overrated as far as I'm concerned.\n\nPros\n-DeNiro is great\n-Foster's story line is interesting and compelling\n-theme has weight\n-Superb camera work\nCons\n-boring mainly due to the music", "label": 0}

{"text": "Overall, a reasonably high quality, no frills, DVD. My main criticism is that the full screen format left out a lot of detail at the periphery, for instance in the scene when Chaney (Bronson) challenges Pettibon's Cajun fighter. In the dispute after the fight all we hear is the click of a gun, we are left to assume from the there is an armed man because he is totally invisible. Likewise when Chaney shoots up Pettibon's honkytonk, some of the time he is aiming at invisible targets like the old fashioned pay phone on the wall (I only know this because I remember seeing this film at a movie theater back in the 70's. To appreciate what you are missing you have to compare the wide aspect opening scene (when Chaney hops off a freight train) with the rest of the film. I imagine they only transferred the opening scene in 2.35:1 so that you can read the titles. A wide aspect ratio is important when there is a lot of dynamic action going on and lets face it it's the fight scenes that are the most important part of the movie.

When I saw it in the theater I was so caught up in the story that I didn't pay too much attention to its bargain-basement racism.  Today, it's so heavy handed and obvious I'm amazed I could have missed it.\nThis story of a young American caught smuggling Hashish out of Istanbul goes out of its way to depict Turkey as a brutal, corrupt country, full of \"furriners.\"  Oliver Stone's script is embarrassing in places, particularly when Billy Hayes gives his big speech in court, calling Turkey \"a nation of pigs.\"  Talk about begging the question!  I would be surprised if anyone of Turkish descent were not deeply offended by this.\nAs long as you don't take it too seriously, Midnight Express can be an enjoyable non-think action movie.  John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.  (It's a safe bet that no actual Turks were used in the making of this film, which was shot in Malta.)  Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack has dated badly, but is still catchy.\nThe DVD features an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 TVs)with an excellent picture.

This movie on the other hand was a let down for me. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, the feeling of suspence, and the over all fright factor the game created for so many. This has instead been replaced with a slick sci-fi-action movie with some sub-par acting and some reasonable special effects. The movie follows the game's story VERY loosly (there are still zombies, there are still guns, there are still STARS comandos, there is a high-tech lab, and they threw in the Licker monster from RE2....thats about it), which is one of the main reasons I was disapointed with this film. Many of the fans know and love the twisting, mysterious story of the orrigional game, and it has been replaced with a movie that is remanesent of Starship Troopers (not that this is particularly bad, but it is a huge change from the orrigional story). All-in-all, this was not a bad movie by any means, and is a fun action flick that you should at least rent, however, I believe RE fans will be some what disapointed.

{"text": "I really don't like writing negative reviews.  I like to write about things I enjoy, it makes the process of writing reviews much more enjoyable.  But every now and again something so rotten comes along that I've gotta say something.  This is the case with Resident Evil.  Hollywood seems to be getting into a zombie phase these days.  This is scary coz Hollywood knows about as much about making a good zombie flick as I know about nuclear fusion.  History has shown us that all great zombie flicks have been made outside the system.  There are many reasons I hate this film, but here's the top two:  1) I'm a fan of George Romero, and 2) I'm a fan of the video game series.  Resident Evil is a game based on the works of George Romero, yet Romero wasn't allowed to do this film.  Just like a previous reviewer, I have also read some of Romero's original script for Resident Evil.  If he made it, it would have been superb.  Why wasn't it chosen?  Probably coz it was intelligent, it actually stuck very close to the story, it would have been about two hours long, and it would have been too gory for an R rating.  In other words-for people who like good horror films and not cruddy rock video type films.  Instead the studios figured that they'd go with Paul Anderson since he directed another lame movie version of a video game.  This film actually has a decent opening sequence, but falls flat on it's face afterwards.  Anderson decided to take it upon himself to change the story, and not for the better either.  Now everthing is all high tech and computerized.  Part of the scariness of the game was it's simplicity.  It's down and dirty approach to survival.  We have yet another clone of 2001's HAL in the form of a computer security system called the Red Queen(oooooh, scary).  Everything's a cliche in this film, no surprises.  The soundtrack is dated and annoying.  It's full of that lame Matrix slo-mo junk we've seen a million times before, as well as those lame VanDamme-esque slo-mo kicks and punches.  The \"Licker\" is pitiful.  I've seen scarier creatures in Fraggle Rock.  The cast is all pretty people, not real looking people.  All of the scientists in the beginning are hot women!  Yeah, right.  There's a scene stolen from the movie, \"Cube\".  There's basically no gore.  Sorry to sound so shallow, but the sad fact is that gore is required for a zombie film.  The only positive I can think of is the zombie dogs which looked good.  But that's the only good I could find out of an hour and forty minutes.  I feel so sorry for Romero.  He's really been getting the green weenie lately.  First, he's screwed out of Resident Evil, then some no-talent hack by the name of Zack Snyder remakes Dawn Of The Dead!  And this is Romero's genre!  He made this genre, now they're treating him like a doormat.  Accept no imitations and make it a Romero night!", "label": 0}
{"text": "I found this interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre good. One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood.\nHowever, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional.\nI have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise.

The \"real\" Joan wasn't even considered important in France until the 1800's, when her story  was resurrected (and embellished - current scholarship doubts whether  Orleans was actually under siege at all!) But (sigh), he decided to give it  his *treatment*, and this is what we end up with: two and a half hours of  his wife (and \"Leeloo\" from \"The Fifth Element\")  alternately screaming, shrieking, or whimpering in the face of anyone who  happens to be standing by. The scrolling text at the opening of the film  was illegible and flipped by so quickly no one could read it, not that it  seemed to matter. Any \"plot\" is sublimated to the \"art\"  - gorgeous photography, lush scenery, and realistically violent battle  scenes. Warning - this is serious stuff, not a candied-up rendition of  medieval warfare. Back in those days, you took out your enemy not by  gunfire, but by debilitating them in as serious fashion as possible,  including maces, axes, the ubiquitous swords, and some even less pleasant  and graphically-demonstrated methods. But along the way, Besson loses  whatever guiding vision originally prompted him to make this film.  Characters start to answer questions with \"Whatever\", the  Dauphine (John Malkovich playing the usual invertebrate) seems less  interested in being King than he is in where the cast party will be, Faye  Dunaway snaps and snarls in a puzzling way (one minute she's Joan's biggest  patron, only to turn on her with no discernable motivation), and in one of  the BIGGEST casting bloopers in the last half of the 20th century, Dustin  Hoffman shows up looking like a retread Obi Wan Kenobe, sounding like  Dustin Hoffman, and is supposed to be \"The Conscience\"  (apparently because the gaping plot holes required SOME sort of cinematic  asphalt to keep the audience at least partially \"in\" on what is  supposed to be transpiring). This is certainly the most serious problem  with the movie: if Hoffman is intended to be a sort of mental foil ,  voicing Joan's inner doubts, he certainly takes his time in making his  presence known. If the movie is intended to illuminate Joan's  \"human\" aspects (as opposed to her spiritual side), then  three-quarters of the film is wasted on one battle scene after another with  nary a glimmer of self-doubt or moral questioning. Buckets of blood, to be  sure.\nNo, this isn't the \"thinking man's Joan\" by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see \"whatever\"),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current \"significant other\"  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.", "label": 0}

It was if Scorcese expected the viewer to be familiar enough with the book to fill in the blanks.

The splendor and pageantry of the upper class of the age was enjoyable, and the cinematography that highlighted the lifestyle was incredible.  The dinner sequences with the multitudes of courses, each carefully and artfully arranged for the guests was very impressive.  The period gowns were exquisite.  I was speechless over the tableau of famous artists displayed on the walls of the homes of the characters, paintings or replicas of works in the style of Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, Singer Seargent, and classical types by earlier painters.  I was especially impressed to see the incredible \"Dual after the Ball\" by Jean Gerome hanging over a settee in one of the homes.  It's one of my favorite paintings.\nAgain, as in the book, the romance seemed tepid.  The illicit lovers were hardly alone together enough to have gotten past social pleasantries when they are expressing enduring passion.  This is true of the book too, but in the book there is a certain sense of the ridiculous, a sense of two self centered people enjoying tormenting themselves over a relationship they couldn't have.  From the book one comes away with a sense that a young man with everything to lose was kept on the straight and narrow by conniving relatives who have his best interests at heart, like an Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw manner play.  The Scorsese film has more of the feel of Ibsen, parted lovers doomed to plodding through life without one another, mere spectators to the drama of other people's lives.  Maybe that's how we all feel as we give up youthful dreams for the responsiblities of adulthood.", "label": 2}

{"text": "As it is the case with most sequels, this second instalment of \"Resident Evil\" franchise is significantly inferior to the first film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILLERS.\n\nThis film begins 30 days after the contamination of the Hive described in the first \"Resident Evil\" movie. In opening scenes the Umbrella Corporation attempts to unseal the Hive in order to eliminate its undesirable occupants and reclaim this huge, precious facility. It is suggested that this attempt doesn't go very well... Some days later Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an abandoned hospital in Raccoon City, naked, bruised and unable to remember jack... And then the film really begins.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film is that there is virtually no scenario, just a succession of shootouts and running. There is hardly any dialogs which would merit to be remembered, the sense of humour seems to have been completely eaten by zombies, most of decisions taken by people (both villains and good guys) doesn't make the slightest sense and let's not even talk about character development...\n\nMilla Jovovich was asked to play here just a standard issue superhuman shooting machine and was clearly forbidden by the director to do and say anything else than shooting - and her two principal sidekicks, with whom she joins ultimately after more than 40 minutes (!) of film are even worse!\n\nSienna Guillory plays Jill Valentine, a police officer belonging to the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) who has the habit of coming to work dressed as a streetwalker and greatly praised may she be for that, because this firmer model is a supremely beautiful woman with such a figure, that Phidias and Praxiteles would KILL for the privilege of sculpting her (in more sense than one...). BUT, an actress she is REALLY not and even saying two lines of dialog is for her clearly an effort... And as for her character being an action hero, well, let's just say that she cannot even hold correctly the prop gun they gave her, because this thing clearly scares her...\n\nOded Fehr plays Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from Umbrella Corporation private army - but being a simple soldier, he is completely unaware of all the evil plans of his bosses and in this film he actually is one of the good guys. Oded Fehr, who usually plays Bedouin holy warriors, demons from Hell or Arab terrorists, has of course all the necessary competence and physical attributes to make an awesome, legendary, bad@ss mercenary - but he is not really allowed in this film to do much. His character is just a subdued sidekick of Alice...\n\nAnother big issue with this film, that everything is centred around Alice and it really is hard to understand why is she SOOO important? Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? But even worse, Alice enters the movie for real only after 40 minutes and in the meantime nothing really very important happens...\n\nThe second part of the film (once Alice appears) is slightly better than the completely useless first 40 minutes, but the operative word here is \"slightly\". There is a couple of good action scenes, but they are few and short. Of course, between those good action scenes quite a lot of munitions gets expended but mostly it is just a shooting of various fish in the barrels.\n\nThere is one sequence, involving an elementary school, which is not bad and will certainly delight all those who simply hate kids and puppies. It also makes sense that in the middle of an anthropophagic zombie infestation an elementary school is a particularly dangerous place, because playful kids need hearty balanced meals on a regular basis...))) On another hand the director couldn't follow this idea until its logical conclusion, because then this film would probably be banned in most countries...\n\nThe ending logically opens the way for the next film in the franchise and ask again the same question: Alice! Who the (----) is Alice?\n\nBottom line, this film is really not good and I managed to suffer through it all the way until the end only with some fast forwarding here and there (especially during all the one sided shootouts). This DVD is definitely NOT a keeper. Avoid!", "label": 0}

{"text": "The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.\n\nIt seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.\n\nThere is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the \"trip\" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.\n\nAs I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.\n\nkone", "label": 0}

Indecisively I say: Besson does not seem to be able to make his mind up whether Joan is  a superheroine or some crazy mixed up little girl. Although I loved the  flashiness and imagination of the 5th Element, something is definitely  missing in this film.\nIt takes Dustin Hoffman's late (and all to brief)  arrival into the film to start giving it the darkness it deserves. After  all, the story seems to be about rebelleion against tyranny, betrayal and  faith.\nThe period is captured well and the battle scenes capture the gore  and dirt well enough (crows and dogs nibbling at the dead adds another  dimension).\nThe big question is of course Milla Jovovich herself. She  spends most of the movie bewildered. She tries to capture the essence of a  woman possessed but ends up making a brave although lacking attempt. This  kind of role requires a masterful performance to bring out all the nuances.  The same indecision seemed to be behind Malkovitch's acting - I was  expecting a Valmont (although Faye Dunaway did a good job as the wicked  step mother).\nI did like the overblown English accents and the battle  hardened French generals but after the film I was no more wise as to  whether Joan was the messenger of God or a lunatic possessed.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.\n\nTo begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.\n\nThe bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichs to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.\n\nI would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.\n\nOverall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.\n\nGrade: ** out of *****", "label": 0}

There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.\n\nThe ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching \"Beauty and the Beast\" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.\n\nThe authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.\n\nFinally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's \"Zoolander\" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in \"Dummy\" than she does in her \"Resident Evil-Apocalypse\" outfits.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Everyone alive has seen this movie by now, so there's no point in writing yet another review.  I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus, who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever.  And I mean that.  He's untalented, irritating and just terrible in every role.  I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny, abrasive, neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie.  And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better.  That includes Close Encounters, the Goodbye Girl, What About Bob, etc.  Honestly, I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors.  This movie is one of those.  So I was compelled to watch it.  But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction.  It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him, and obviously, I'm still unhappy that they tried.  I don't know who's life he saved, or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in.  He, by himself, brought this movie down two full stars.  Still a good one, but it could have been really superb without him.  Well, there it is.

{"text": "The world of this movie was never meant for one as deficient genetically as this Vincent, we are given to understand. In this nearish future, genetic design is depicted as at least a frequent occurrence, perhaps even the norm. Vincent was conceived normally and brings into the world a daunting catalogue of infirmities, summed up in a life-expectancy of 30 years, low by even the standards of certain far eastern countries today. This does not sit well with his consuming ambition to travel into space, and the film builds a collection of different plots and sub-plots around this basic quandary.\n\nTo start with what is particularly good about Gattaca, the sets are striking. They create a `futuristic' aura very successfully, so much so that they they actually forced my attention on to what I believe to be one aspect of the film's main weakness, namely the plot or plots - Vincent's basic dilemma does not require a future setting at all. If he had been a weakling trying to get into a career in, say, sport or the armed services in 2004 that would have dealt with the issue just as well. The other thing that is distinctly good, in a certain kind of way, is the acting. When Gore Vidal, of all people, makes an early entrance in the role of Director, I reflected momentarily that I had never seen him acting before. In an instant I had corrected myself - I have never seen Vidal not acting. He acts a persona of his own creating whenever he appears on the media, and it is no surprise that he carries off his film role so convincingly. The Director is a far simpler personality that the real-life Gore Vidal. The three main roles are taken by Ethan Hawke as Vincent, Jude Law as the crippled but genetically perfect Jerome, and Uma Thurman as Irene. Like the Director, the characters are schematic and line-drawn, and such as they are they are very well done. The trouble, I hate to say, is the plotting.\n\nNot only is the basic setting not really required, the theme of Vincent's physical frailty actually has nothing to do with the ethical question of designer-vs-natural conception either. These threads are separate strands thrown into a single bag, so to speak, but not woven together. In much the same way the murder investigation, which threatens to blow Vincent's cover and reveal his clever DNA exchange with Jerome, is very loosely integrated with the main action - anything of that kind would have taken only the smallest mischance to come to light, and the efforts of the investigators make the quest for certain weapons in Iraq even as I write look a model of competence. It all left me not even needing to make a willing supension of disbelief at how an impoverished janitor obtained the funds first to pay the rapacious clandestine transgenetics operator and second to pay his way though the Gattaca induction programme. To cap it all, there is a further sub-plot of sibling rivalry between Vincent and his eugenic younger brother Anton, which must be important, I have to assume, as one of their periodic swimming contests takes place at the climactic stage of the story. And of course there is a love-theme as well, in case the film ran out of themes.\n\nI suppose this could hardly be called a rave-notice, and I fully admit that the film at least held my attention. It is not a bad film by any means, but the nearer in time to us that such an action is supposed to take place the harder it is to keep one's normal rational faculties switched off.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.\n\nI still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.\n\nHowever, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).\n\nThe first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.\n\nThe film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as \"beautiful\" and \"fitting the mood\".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.\n\nAt least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.", "label": 2}
{"text": "You watch an Ed Wood film, it's bad, but it's fun. It's fun because the director cared, and despite the fact that Ed Wood wasn't a good director, his personality and care is evident in his films.\n\nResident Evil is made by Paul Anderson, and he quite obviously doesn't care.\n\nForget what all of you are saying about 'It's another silly zombie movie' or 'It's from a game so I suppose it was always going to be bad'.\n\nThe reality is, the games are extremely well executed, as are George A Romero films (G.A.R being the original guy who was to direct this.)\n\nA great story is in the telling, this story was not told well. It could not have been told worse. This guy, quite obviously, has no idea of how to tell a story or direct a film. I trusted him due to Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon, but after Resident Evil and the appauling AVP, it would appear that those first two films are only as good as they are due to good producers and scripts.\n\nStay away, stay well away.\n\nAn absolute travesty in every sense.

Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness.

{"text": "Sitting in a USC screening room with Peter Fonda, I remember seeing this iconic film before it was released.  At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.\n\nThe movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption \"A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere\" resonated with me.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots \"Billy\" and \"Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)\" I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life. END SPOILER ALERT.\n\nThis film was the first big \"youth movie\" that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.  It was a bulls-eye.  For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.  This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.\n\nAs a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)  I liked ow the movie broke some cinematic rules, like the law of \"consistent screen direction\" by having the bikes go in all directions.  There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?\n\nI wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.  He smiled and said, \"Of course.\"  I liked that.  I liked the stoned \"Freedom\" speech from Jack Nicholson.  I believed what Jack said.  Those were my words too!  This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.\n\nI still love the joyful, free, wide-angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's \"Born to be Wild\" pulsating on the soundtrack.  \"Get your motor running...\"  Oh yeah.\n\nWatching the movie today with the hindsight of alleged maturity(?), I now see an amateurish film.  Indulgent and sloppy.  Silly in places.  But the core question of What Is America? rings truer than ever.\n\nLook for ward-of-the-state, convicted murderer and former record producer Phil Spector as a dope dealer in the opening scenes.

{"text": "It is rather ironic to think that the elfin Mickey Rooney would provide one of the best voices for Santa Claus ever in this 1970 stop-motion animated Christmas classic, but that is exactly what we have here. \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.\n\nProduced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic \"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town.\" These include \"First Toymaker To the King,\" \"Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),\" \"Put One Foot in Front of the Other,\" \"My World is Beginning Today,\" and \"What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol).\" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.\n\nThe story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin). The Island of Misfit Toys makes the other one the more beloved Holiday classic, but this one is a close second, and Jessica is the cutest future Mrs. Claus of all-time.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.\n\nThe government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.\n\nThe climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.\n\nIt's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.  Anyone else can safely skip it since there are far more entertaining films for you to choose from.", "label": 0}

The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies.

Particularly disappointing was the fact that Luke and Savannah, two of the  main characters in the book, barely featured in the movie.  Focussing so  much on the romance between Tom and Lowenstein, only a secondary storyline  in the novel, may have made the story more straightforward but also more  ordinary.  Nick Nolte was great as Tom and I did enjoy the movie, but after  reading the book and knowing what the film could have been I feel a bit  disappointed.

People have the tendency to judge a country and its entire people based on a movie, which was shot in 1978. Midnight Express is not just a movie. Turkey has been fighting with this image for the whole time.\n\nIt is a true story, all right. There are a lot of movies based on true stories in which the moral is all wrong.

{"text": "The movie is the embodiment of the existentialism philosophy.  [Spoiler Alert]  The road trip [life] has no larger meaning except as an avenue to explore one hedonistic experience after another.  There is no higher purpose and the two protagonists eventually end up dead on the side of the road.  The interesting part of the film is that it tried to portray the counterculture movement as the heirs to the traditional American life.  Wyatt and Billy are modern cowboys.  The hippie communes are the heirs of the traditional farmers and ranchers.  The sentiment is given voice by George Hanson [Jack Nicholson]:  \"You know, this used to be a helluva good country.  I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.\"\n\nEasy Rider also attempts to redefine the traditional American definition of \"freedom.\"  In the same monolog previously mentioned, George Hanson explains that Wyatt and Billy make people nervous because they represent true freedom.  He then defines freedom as the ability to do what you want, when you want, without any societal restraints.  The Founding Fathers of the United States defined freedom [liberty] as the ability to do what was right.  They defined the ability to do whatever you wanted without restraint as licentiousness and warned that it would eventually lead to the loss of freedom and liberty.  Easy Rider and the existentialist culture succeeded in altering the concept of American liberty and freedom away from what the Founders envisioned.\n\nOverall, the movie is a good representation of the existentialist life.  Otherwise, it is a boring and meandering journey with only a few highlights.  I am glad I watched it but it is not going to be a personal favorite.", "label": 0}

The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying \"Muncie, IN\", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it!\nI saw the \"Special Edition\" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition.\nHowever, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing.\nBut, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia/TriStar/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters.\nThe picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented.\nTo have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi/action DVD collection would be almost complete.", "label": 2}

But the movie itself remains the same old version, missing a good bit of the car chase which, for some reason, was included in European copies but was never shown in the US.\n\nThe missing part - check it out on imdb - takes place when Roy Scheider's wife, rushing to the TV studio with the tape, drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail: there, she skids into a wall on two wheels, bangs the roof of her car, then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other - and this is what makes Scheider wince from his chopper above.\n\nApart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work, this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole, when we see the car drive into the TV studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop.\n\nGranted, this missing part is no big deal, but it certainly makes this so-called 'Special Edition' a bit of a disappointment.\n\nFive stars for the movie, three for the DVD.", "label": 2}
{"text": "HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity.  Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.\n\n  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Like the video game it's based on, Resident Evil delivers the shocks, scares, and screams we've come to expect from the game.  However, the movie doesn't offer quite an eerie atmosphere as we've come to expect from the game, but then again this isn't the game we're talking about.  Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who brought another video game series to the big screen with the original Mortal Kombat, as well as Event Horizon) directs with his usual flair and penchant for some bloody (but not very gorey, most of the gore is kept off screen) violence.  However, the film isn't scary at all, the only thing that is  scary is how gorgeous Milla Jovovich is.  You'll know pretty much when something is going to happen, and the special effects could have been more polished, I mean you can tell that the Licker is computer generated, it doesn't even look real at all.  However, the film does have some things going for it, the original storyline (as in not taken from the game but inspired by it) is a refreshment, and the score which handled by Marilyn Manson adds the movie.  All in all, Resident Evil is a mixed bag, but it is a lot better than a lot of the other garbage out today (XXX anyone?).", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is the first movie in the supposed Resident Evil trilogy and so far, things aren't off to a great start.\n  For a horror movie, it borders on all-right to bad. For a movie based on a video game it's pretty bad. Not much from the original games is really intact in this movie.  Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.\n  Horror movie wise, there isn't that many great moments in the movie. The zombies are mediocre, I'd take Romero or Jackson zombies over these ones any day.  They're just not that frightning and they don't do a whole lot.  The part with the dogs is fairly decent, but the licker at the end of the movie is just plain laughable and crappy. The budget wasn't very big for this movie, but I've seen TV movies with better special effects then this movies licker. Although I must admit, the part where they're trapped in the corridor with lazers that our out of control, is one of those \"wow\" moments of horror movies.\n  The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie. Other characters in the movie could live or die without the audience caring much, unless you're like me and would rather just see them all die. The story is descent enough for what this movie is, but it's nothing to write home about.\n  Overall, it's all right, but I'd stick with the 2nd movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse for a better time being entertained.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Set in the year 1985, SLC (Salt Lake City) Punk stars Matthew Lillard as Stevo, one of two punks caught in the heart of conservatism in Salt Lake City, or Salt Lake Sh*tty, as they would say.\nNever being a big fan of Lillard (Scooby Doo, Wing Commander, Scream), I waited nearly two years before picking this movie up.  I have to say I was impressed by his portrayal of Stevo, along with the rest of the movie.\nMany of the ideals of punk are explored, a lot of times in narrative, such as anarchy, rebellion, fighting, drugs, changing the system, sell outs, poseurs, music, and random chaos.  I really didn't get a sense of the true punk scene, not like I did with Sid and Nancy, but this movie was entertaining.\nBasically the movie follows Stevo and his friend, Heroin Bob around and documents their existence.  We get a view into their politics, social circles, lifestyle, relationships, and their difficulties in being a part of the counterculture in conservative America.  The film tends to bounce around somewhat erratically, but that seemed in line to me with the subject matter.  There are a number of very funny scenes, including one involving a trip to Wyoming for alcohol. Utah sells alcohol, but the sale of such spirits is highly restrictive.  I especially enjoyed the ending, even though I did see it coming, but Lillard's performance during the scene really helped to make it work.\nA good supporting cast, an excellent music score, and fine direction work together to make this movie worth looking into, especially if you have any interest in the punk scene in America during the 80's.  I didn't get a sense that it was completely representative of the movement, but maybe it's not supposed to be...I don't know.\nThere are some decent extras, including a commentary track by the director and some of the stars, an isolated music score, a couple of trailers, production notes, and an SLC comic book (not an actual comic book, but one you can view on the screen).  Oh yeah, if you are easily offened by the liberal use of profanity, you might skip this one as the cursing comes fast and furious.", "label": 2}

I really enjoyed the scenes and got all nostalgic when I saw Positively 4th Street and the parks and streets of SL. I moved to Oregon since then. Bob seemed to be the most authentic portrayal of any punks I knew. Most of the punks I knew weren't very violent and they didn't run around yelling PUNK ROCK or ANARCHY! They were artists and musicians and they were far more interesting and individual than the films half baked portrayal. Especially Stevo.......poser. Mike was interesting and seemed like more of the people I knew......people who were just themselves and not trying to live up to any label. Real punks don't call themselves punk very often.......its just the way they are. The most interesting crowd were the ones you couldn't outwardly identify anyway. Too many labels in this film. Irritating.....and I didn't buy Stevo becoming a lwayer either....but some scenes were fun....like the acid trip at the park and some of the interactions. They should have gone more into Mormon history and culture. HALF BAKED! But worth a glance and a laugh.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.\nThe story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.\nI do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.\nJustine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?\nThe portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.\nOverall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.", "label": 2}

And then, we are off, as Alice (Jovovich) hooks up with some others (Guillory, Holt, Fehr) trapped in the city.  The city has been locked down because the virus from the first movie has gotten out of the Hive.  The group is offered assistance in getting out if they can find and rescue the daughter of an Umbrella Corp. employee.  Added incentive comes in the form of a nuclear cleansing of the city that is on its way.  Along the way, they will deal with zombies, more of the creatures from the first movie, and the Nemesis (a really big, ugly mutant with a creepy smile).\n\n\"Apocalypse\" falls short of the confined terror of the first film.  The underground nature of the original added to the rising tension, while here the players have the run of the city.  Plus, to some extent, there is not much new here.  The Nemesis is a creepy adversary, but he introduced fairly early on, and his eventual end is no surprise, given the events of the first film.  There is also another cliffhanger of sorts at the end to set up another sequel.\n\nChances are, if you liked the first film, you will like this one as well.

Read the book and Anatoli Bourkeev's \"The Climb\" instead of watching this piece of [...], both are far better (I consider \"The Climb\" to be better than \"Into Thin Air\", which has better prose but reeks of the blame game, just my two cents\"). I would also recommend the IMAX movie \"Everest\", which doesn't go as deep into the tragic events as this (because it is not about them) but is none the less a fantastic documentery.", "label": 0}

This movie had no gore and a female lead that could act but I like my women more voluptuous.  Story is confusing but unimportant anyway so don't worry about it.  American movies should not be censored or at least available in an uncut form because the audience for this type of movie demands it and this is the land of the free.

{"text": "Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead.\n\nMilla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive.\n\nThe characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt \"R\" for language and the little nudity.\n\nThis film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game.\n\nAnother lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?\n\nResident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film like that.", "label": 2}

{"text": "If I could best describe this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, \"SLC Punk,\" is just plain stupid. This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at \"The Sundance Film Festival\" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the \"F-word\" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that \"less is more.\" There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to \"go-against-the-grain.\" It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing. There's not a whole lot I can say about SLC Punk, other than I think it's a complete waste of time and money. This movie is rated [R] for: Profanity, Vulgarity, Drug Use, Teen Partying, and Violence.

{"text": "This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.\n\nJoseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.\n\nThe story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well.", "label": 1}
{"text": "What makes Jane Eyre a timeless novel is it's brilliantly colorful and evocative narrative. Charlotte Bronte's true talent is in her wording and her vivid and unique characters. This movie falls desperately short on these most important fronts. The narrative to this adaptation is poor indeed and lacks any of the fiery spark of the novel. Rather than choosing to re-work the first section of the story touching on Jane's childhood, a voice-over jumps from moment to moment so that we have only brief flashes of her early life, making for a stilted and bumbling beginning. The filmography is desperately lacking, and by inserting \"imaginary\" voices and images into Jane's perception, appears to imply a psychotic rather than imaginative narrator. Samantha Morton, whose work is usually delightful and full of life, is the image of Jane without any of the spirit. Ciaran Hinds, though he has some of Mr. Rochester's manner, is lacking in the overall demeanor. Gemma Jones makes for an unnecessarily snappish Mrs. Fairfax and Timia Berthone's acting is self-conscious to the point of embarrassment.\n\nI am deeply disappointed in A&E whose work can usually be depending upon.

{"text": "There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.\n\nThe 1977 \"Jesus of Nazareth\" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.\n\nMr. Gibson's \"The Passion\" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)\n\nThis is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense \"The Passion.\"\n\nThis film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the \"Gospel According to Luke.\"  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.\n\nAlright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.\n\nI'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read \"Luke,\" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.\n\nThe sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in \"The Passion.\" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.\n\nLike I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,\" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.\n\nAnother thing I should point out is that \"The Passion\" is NOT child friendly. \"Jesus of Nazareth\" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of \"The Passion.\" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from \"Luke.\" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in \"The Passion.\"\n\nAnother thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written \"Good News Bible.\"\n\nI like \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The Passion.\" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.", "label": 1}

Its a period piece, in the years after WWI, going through the Great Depression, and while the boys take their separate paths, they're always tied to each other because of family, home, and their mutual love of fly fishing.\n\nRobert Redford directed this family drama, and as always, you can see his love for nature in every scene. Hes also the narrator in the movie, so if you think you recognize the voice in the beginning of the movie, you're right. Redford specializes in directing beautiful nature scenes and capturing emotional turmoil within a family. A River Runs Through It is very pretty to watch, but as much as I love Robert Redford, its not my favorite of his films. Dont throw anything at me, but Im not really a Brad Pitt fan, so I found myself rooting for Tom Skerrit more often than not.\n\nWatch the preview to see if its your style.

Julie and her roommate Karla (Brandy) prove they have no knowledge of capitals and can't recognize a FAMILIAR voice that they are well acquainted with on a daily basis.

{"text": "Faye Dunaway is one of my favorite actresses.  She gives a good performance but is limited by a mediocre plot in this mediocre movie.  She is the Laura Mars of the title. Laura is a high fashion photographer who mixes sex with violence in her photography.  In 1978 it was a more controversial issue than it seems to be today. Its thin veneer serve as a token plot theme.\n\nOut of nowhere Laura begins having psychic visions of murders of people she knows which turn out to be real; all committed by the same killer, through whose eyes she envisions the murders.  I say out of nowhere because there is no indication that she ever had psychic visions in her past.  It makes for a faulty plot non-sequitur, especially since she is obviously at least in her 30's when she begins to have these visions for the first time.\n\nProduced by Jon Peters, one-time hair stylist and ex-husband of Barbra Streisand who sings the title song, the story is long on glitz and short on thrills or chills.  There are plenty of topless models getting dressed and some very attractive young women added to cover a very thin plot.\n\nA young Tommy Lee Jones plays detective John Neville who is in charge of Laura's well-being while the killer is on the loose. He is still a few years and film experience away from developing the persona that has made him so popular today.  His performance is uneven at best and he seems to have real difficulties with the role. His performance in the final scene must make him cringe today.\n\nRene Auberjonois gives the best supporting performance as Laura's agent/promoter.  Raul Julia is credible as her ex-husband but does not have the chance with such a small role to show the potential that would lead to his brilliant performance in \"The Kiss of the Spider Woman\" in 1985.\n\nIf you buy it, get it cheap.", "label": 2}

Right from the start, I wish that there had been more of Danny Devito as the cartoon cat, but that may just be because I'm a Danny Devito fan...Arnold just doesn't do it for me.  The ridiculous nature of the \"action movie\" was quite enjoyable (sadly, action movies in our world aren't that far off) and the villain, played by Charles Dance, didn't quite stray into an area that I like to refer to as \"stereotypical creepy\".  I enjoyed the satirical elements of this film, though I stop and wonder how the makers of real action films come up with some of their stuff.  I mean, I thought all the satire was right on the money, so have action movies really strayed so much?  Anyway, I found the leading lad, Austin O'Brien, okay, though he seemed to stray from whining to annoyingly over-confident the whole time, neither of which are appealing traits for me.  I actually found Robert Prosky as the theatre attendant more interesting...Danny Devito still wins though.  Overall, this was the perfect film for Arnold Schwarzenegger as it basically poked fun at what he did best while allowing him to continue doing it.

{"text": "The movie is sort of a crossover between the genres of zombies [a la Night of the Living Dead] and artificial intelligence gone wrong [in the mode of one of the less good early X-files episodes]. The result is a mediocre horror flick, with a story not convincing enough and character development far from sophisticated enough for the movie to be even slightly memorable.\n\nThe atmosphere is clinical, very much reminiscent of Event Horizon, another movie made by the same director Paul Anderson, only that Event Horizon is a slightly more interesting movie. The movie's sterilized feel is almost devoid of human emotions, even in the one or two forced scenes where the characters are supposed to express sympathy and compassion. Those scenes are ineffective. It feels like the script writers feel compelled to include them only to make sure the audience can distinguish the otherwise cold and expressionless human characters from the zombies and artificial intelligence. The stubborn refusal to develop the characters in any three-dimensional sense is rather annoying.\n\nEven if one treats it as a ride in an amusement park, the movie fails to really deliver. The zombie attacks are clichd, and you could feel that even the cast sometimes shows in the movie their own lack of interests. Humor, in any form, is also conspicuously missing in the movie.

{"text": "This unsightly contribution in Milla Jojovich's career proves quite well that, aside from looking breathless, panting and screaming, the actress cannot tackle a serious acting challenge.\nA true mockery of Joan of Arc, this film conspires to make the Poucelle D'Orleans seem like a deranged woman incapable of controlling an army-- whereas the historical Joan of Arc showed an eerie capacity for military manoeuvres, whose fame became to widespread that entire cities surrendered at the mention of Joan of Arc at their gates.\nThrough her (dictated) letters (for she was presumably illiterate), and her recorded answers to the Inquistion, we have come to know that Joan of Arc, born in Domremy, was an unusually lucid 16-year-old (she was burned at the stake at the age of 19) with a gift for words (which may give credibility that she was actually related to the Dauphin through the bloodline of Anne the Adultress and thus must have received some degree of education), as well as sharing the distinction of being the middle age's most distinguished transvestite (sharing the same historical period as the Basque transvestite and noblewoman Catalina de Erauzo, the Lieutenant Nun).\nMilla Jojovich's portrayal of Joan of Arc is insulting to anyone that has ever studied this remarkable character, giving us instead a histrionic and half-mad woman who cannot keep her composture for a second and who apparently has the resolution of a twig, fueled into battle by unknown fervors that vanish as soon as the battle scene is over. Joan of Arc was a hard and somewhat fanatical Christian, but in no way was she the blithering idiot that Jojovich's acting makes her out to be. There is also a scene of \"self-examination\" during Joan's captivity with the Burgundians that serves little point other than to stress the idea that Joan is absolutely nuts. Indeed, all the Damsel of Orleans does through half the movie is to claw and hyperventilate... truly a shameful performance, and abysmal script-writing.\nIf you want a GOOD film about Joan of arc, check out the Criterion Collection and look up Carl Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, don't waste your time with this Hollywood-produced piece of glitz, filth and shallowness.", "label": 0}

I thought it would be an alarmingly patriotic and gung-ho affair with little thought for anyone outside of the US, with the amount of disbelief needing to be suspended astronomical.

Glenn Close hams along as a cringe-inducingly patriotic vice president, with some of the most cliched and predictable lines ever. Gary Oldman is a little better, but still plays a stereotypical hollywood villian who engages in just about every deadly sin possible in this movie.\nWolfgang Petersen fails to engage the watcher or bring about any of the sweaty claustrophobia present in his previous epic, Das Boot.

There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first.

{"text": "This movie is the epitome of excess: budget, explosions, melodrama, \"cuteness\", in-jokes.  LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, \" That skit was pretty cool, huh?\".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.\nThe only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble.\nI like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.  Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said, \"Magic ticket, my a**!\".

Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but \"Spice World\" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.\n\nI might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.\n\nBut there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to \"Family Guy\".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.\n\nJust to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in \"Pulp Fiction\" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.\n\nAgain, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.

{"text": "I have not seen the original of this movie, so (if the reviews of others are anything to go by), I am lucky to be able to judge this movie without the acclaimed original in my head as a template.\n\nAnd, I am both amazed and happy to report, as a movie in its own right, this version of \"The Grudge\" more than holds its own against its contemporary horror heavyweights.\n\nStarring Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a much smaller role than one would have thought) and a host of forgettable extras (with the exception of Bill Pullman, again in a tiny role), this movie loosely follows the `haunted house' plot of so many horror movies - funny goings-on inspire further investigation, leading to a high-body-count misadventure resulting in closure for our hapless heroine - but since \"The Grudge\" rehashes this predictable-ish plot with such undeniable style and flair, as well as a few big twists, we don't mind.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me about this movie is that yes, it is genuinely creepy, with some true-blue shock moments. The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.\n\nInitially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.\n\nVisual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.\n\nAll in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now. Recommended.", "label": 2}

Why does the story have to make sense?? Just slap Resident Evil on the cover and people will pay.\n\nThe story begins where the first RE left off. Alice is awakening in an Umbrella hospital and realizes the world is not what she knew. Things are...well they're sh*t Most people are either dead or undead, and the police are trying to create an effective resistance against the zombies. Hotshot, loss cannon S.T.A.R.S cop Jill Valentine takes leave of her suspension and walks into the RPD just in time to cap a few zombies. She then reminds everyone in a tone that is up to par with porn star acting \"They're infected, you have to shoot them  in the head.\"\n\nOh but it get's even better when Jill, her partner, and a reporter are trapped inside a church with two lickers. Alice bursts in on a motorcycle to save the day and the first question I have is, \"How did she know they were there?\"\n\nThen they all get to battle hand to hand with a bunch of rotting graveyard zombies which is funny because A. How did the T-virus infect the already-dead-6ft-burried corpses? and B. why did they choose THAT moment to unearth themselves?\nThe choreagraphy looks good, but then again it's hard to not look like a bad ass when your opponent makes no attempt to defend himself.\n\nLater after making a deal with the lead scientist for a ticket out of this nightmare, they go to a school to retrieve his daughter as their part of the arrangement.\nLow on people and ammo in a school full of zombie kids, they do the smart thing and split up which means; yep you guessed it someone is going to die.\n\nI loved the scene where they find out a nuke is coming to destroy the city.\nJill asks, \"What Yield\"\nAlice, \"50 Megatons\"\nJill, \"!@$! me\"\nNow, how does a police officer know the difference between nuclear yields..and WHY does it matter! It's a nuke! I don't think Umbrella intends on destroying half the city.\n\nWatching Nemesis was just sad. Why is he after S.T.A.R.S members? In the video game it was because they were out to expose Umbrella's dirty secret. In the movie its....\"because they're the best.\" stupid stupid...\n\nResident Evil is how a zombie movie should never be done.\nHorrible acting, a storyline full of holes and inconsistencies, and the feeling that the creators of this \"movie\" cared more about counting the money it would make rather than making somthing decent give this movie the 1 star is most certainly deserves.\nRent it if you want a good laugh, and if you want to watch a decent zombie flick try the new Dawn of the Dead.", "label": 0}

{"text": "THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!\n\n I have never seen anything so insultingly lame! How can people actually LIKE this garbage?! If any proof is needed that our education system has went into the toilet, the popularity of this stupid crap is it. This is not a movie, it's a movie trailer with no story to advertise. If I could give it negative stars, I definitely would.\n\n If you like wrestling and have more than two little Nascar numbers adhered to your car, you'll probably like this inbred junk, otherwise avoid it at all costs. Even that \"Alien vs. Predator\" crap was not this bad, and it reeked as well. The reason they make crappy movies like this is because morons keep paying to see and own them. You people are ruining the world for the rest of us.\n\n If you want to see an actual HORROR movie, pick up The Exorcist, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead (the original, not that stupid remake piece of filth), or Session 9. Those films had a few advantages over this one. For starters, they had DIRECTORS, not Hollywood, pony-knub sporting cel-phone addicts whose parents bought them a career. Secondly, they had STORIES. Actual CHARACTERS with THOUGHTS, say it with me, THOUGHTS...that's right. Their brains were involved in what was happening in the film, they weren't merely posing with guns and puckering their lips at the camera.\n\n This movie is for fans. Do you know what a fan is? It's a person who has already decided that they like something before they have even seen it. that is a form of prejudice. Fans are not flattering to a true Artist, because they aren't evaluating the Artists performance objectively, they are merely \"yes-men\". Cheerleaders. The true Artist doesn't want cheers for bad work. And the hack actor secretly laughs at the fans when they accept garbage as quality.\n\n I'm not trying to be spiteful, but we are being had. There is an elephant in the living room, and someone has to say it.\n\n If you can't see that ALL movies like this are nothing but commercial garbage to feed the great American cattle drive, then you are either hopelessly ignorant, or borderline retarded. There are lots of great movies to see and own, you are wasting your life watching this crap when you could be seeing movies that keep you thinking about them and their characters for days, weeks, months even. Sometimes YEARS. Life is too short for this level of stupidity.\n\n If you DO like it and buy it and even (gag) watch it AGAIN, remember that every time some moron is driving like an idiot and holding you up in traffic, it is because the entertainment industry is dumbing down the country, and they get away with it because people like you are helping them. Movies should involve your brain. They should not use flashy camera moves to try and hide the inadequacies of the writer and director. Stop helping Hollywood make people stupid for money, after all, they aren't giving you any of the money they make.\n\n Or consider this. The people who make movies in hollywood are the same people who nominate and award Oscars. They don't EVER, EVER nominate or award this kind of movie. That is because even THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR OWN FILMS!!! They pretend to in interviews and in commentary tracks, but obviously they aren't going to say \"Well, actually, me and Herbert Bumble-dong only wrote, directed, and produced this film because of all the money we can make off of bovine America\". They won't say that into the camera. They say that to their peers, though. otherwise, their peers would think they were fools. Because only a fool would like a movie this bad.", "label": 0}

The film takes about two steps back and puts the mountain and conditions first.\nIt's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read \"Into Thin Air\" or \"The Climb\" may find it superficially enjoyable.

{"text": "but she was surprisingly lacking in this film.  There are some genuine jump moments (anytime Yuya Ozeki or Takako Fuji are in the frame) and the supporting cast is good (Ted Raimi as a social work facilitator not so good-he showed frustration almost constantly), but Gellar, as Karen Davis, just doesn't have broad enough shoulders to carry a film like this.  The phasing from story to story, so you could get the full picture of how insidious the hatred enveloping this house really is, was interesting.  I liked seeing all the concurrent stories that led up to the moment when Karen tried to burn down the house to kill the spirit.  I enjoyed Clea Duvall's portrayal of sadness and isolation at being in a foreign country, where hardly anyone spoke english.  Her growing frustration and withdrawal from her surroundings made her ultimate demise at the hands of the house very poignant.  But best of all was Yuya Ozeki as Toshio.  The child is beautiful when he looks normal, but put him in that white makeup, with the black eyes and sinisterly sad expression, and you have some really creepy moments when he's in frame.  Takako Fuji as Kayako was also creepy and weird.  Her face, it's almost plastic expressionlessness, was wonderfully scary to behold.  Her flexibility and disjointedness when she crawled down the stairs after Karen was astounding.  And how she got her hand under Gellar's hair on the back of her head in the shower is truly baffling.

{"text": "Resident Evil is from the source movie goers have learned to fear most--video games.  Resident Evil joins the glittering pantheon of such other video game to movie translations such as Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and even Super Mario Brothers.  It's certainly better than most of these but still is far from being a great horror film.\nThe original game started with the simple and uncluttered premise of being stuck in an isolated mansion with mysterious flesh eating mutated zombies and assorted other biological abberations that had to be fought past in order to find out that the whole mess originated from corporate experimentation in biological weaponry.  The game showed through clever use of shock effects, disturbing dramatic camera angles, and cinematic music that video games could be as scary and suspenseful as any horror film. In this way the game was a groundbreaker and amazingly influential and popular.\nNow several years and game sequels later we have Resident Evil the movie.  The film clutters up the premise quite a bit.  Beginning with some unexplained corporate espionage that causes a spooky HAL like computer to kill everyone in the Umbrella building (or as it is explained later an underground hive) it cuts immediately to a half naked Milla Jovovich (she of the crazy red hair in The Fifth Element) waking up with amnesia in a shower and wandering alone in a strangely deserted palatial mansion that the computer is also monitoring.\nWhere are the zombies?\nThey do eventually show up and the creators of this film also borrow heavily from past successes such as Aliens, The Matrix, 2001:A Space Odyssey, and maybe even a little Memento.  The result is a mess and some of the action is incomprehensible sometimes it seems certain characters make their escapes out of impossible situations by simply being edited out of them. But the movie keeps moving frenetically and sometimes entertainingly along anyway.  The rest of the plot revolves around the mystery of the sabotage and a trip down into the sealed hive to solve the mystery.\nFans of the video games will be disappointed to not see Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine make an appearance.  Also zombies, hunters and mutant dogs are pretty much the only mutant monsters you get.\nAs far as the cast goes moviegoers will be left mainly remembering Jovovich's charming beauty and Michelle Rodriguez's(from the much superior low budget Girlfight) tough funny turn as one of the band of clean up soldiers who accompany Jovovich down into the hive.  Sure its a lift of Private Vasquez's character from Aliens but Rodriguez has such a gritty delivery that she makes the tired dialogue sound fresh and intentionally amusing.\nThe thudding rock score by Marilyn Manson does little to help and the various creatures are not imaginative enough to really inspire any horror.  There are various shock effects tactics employed throughout the film to keep moviegoers from getting restless.\nThe movie is an okay ride and probably worth a peak if you're a big zombie or Resident Evil fan.  Most of us will get more out of watching Aliens again.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The essence of my rant:  Samantha Morton good, Ciaran Hinds bad. Adaptation so-so. Pacing of film too hurried.\n\nAlthough this is a more technically faithful adaptation than some I've seen, it was more of a gothic cartoon than a Monet impression of Bronte's novel. A good screenplay of a classic is deft in its choices of what passages to highlight and what to skip, what dialogue will be the best tribute to the original work but bring the characters to life;  what will illuminate the spirit of the novel. This lingered too long on some scenes and skipped over others, so that anyone who has not read the book might wonder what just happened, and it went too hard on some characters and too soft on others, making it harder to grasp their places in the story.\n\nSamantha Morton is a fine choice for Jane--she played it in a mousy, understated way, with a few glimmers of a suppressed personality that was a decent depiction of the character.  And she looked nineteen, which is nice.  However, this served to highlight the creepiness factor when Ciaran Hinds as Edward Rochester comes growling and cussing into the story, acting more deranged and dangerous than his imprisoned wife.  The Hitleresque mustache, looming posture and unblinking stare make him more menacing than sad and brooding.  He barks and snarls his lines with no hint of the intended facetious humor and vulnerability that make Rochester a redeemable character.  When he does make romantic overtures toward Jane, it feels repellent and lecherous.  Not sexy at all.  It seems like Jane needs an intervention rather than finds the love of her life.\n\nWant a better, more lush, fleshed-out, warm-hearted version?  Although he does not answer the Rochester character in looks as well as Hinds, Tobey Stephens in the Masterpiece Theatre production is way, way better:  rude and gruff by turns, guilty over his inability to be kind to Adele, with a tortured sense of duty to Bertha, his expressions and manner soften, his banter with Jane is amusing and the pivotal romantic scene is tender, fulfilling in the way it should be. Wilson is lovely, plain one moment and a shining pearl the next--perfect casting there.  Basically, you can picture Ruth Wilson and Stephens making love, and the thought does not make you shudder.  There you have it:  this should be a love story.", "label": 2}

{"text": "THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.\nI am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this \"film\" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.\nWhat makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).\nThe film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.\nDo yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.\n\nThis is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.\n\nGary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.\n\nJackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.\n\nIf you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.\n\nAn underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I loved Pat Conroy's book, The Prince of Tides.  I looked forward to the film version.  Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play Tom Wingo.  I have no qualms with the rest of the cast.  I, too, wish that more of the story (of Luke especially) could have been told.  But, I have no major problem with the screenplay and the direction served the script fine.\nMy problem is that Streisand as producer and director should have read the damn book a little closer when it came to the character of Lowenstein, the psychiatrist.  She was described as upper-class, slim & dark,  cultured, refined & immaculate.  Now, Barbra may be interesting & intelligent....but classy and refined she ain't.  Not with footlong violet fingernails that would rival the Dragonlady's.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book, it would have worked...but I doubt it.\nCasting in a movie is half the battle.  And that her ego allowed her to cast herself in this role says more about Barbra's delusions than it does her talent.  She told the story well, but the great love and understanding between Wingo and Lowenstein just wasn't believable for me between Nolte and Streisand.\nToo bad, because she handled the rest of the movie pretty well.  I only wrote this because Barbra did a lot of bitching at the time that she was overlooked at Oscar time for Best Director.  I truly feel that had she cast that role to someone else and JUST directed, she would have made the list.  But, she had to make the movie a Barbra Streisand movie starring Barbra and thereby sank it rom potentially great to just a good film. Ego will get you every time.  3-1/2 stars.", "label": 2}

The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any \"doll\", \"dame\" or \"mouse?\", would fall for either of these gals.\n\nAnyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.

{"text": "No Mercy is one of those films that is not really that bad, but it leaves you wondering how did they get big stars to do it.  In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit, an ex-wife, and a bad rep.  So what happens to him?  Well his good natured partner (you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down.  So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story.  This will bring him to New Oreans(that whole \"fish-out-of-water\" thing), and to Kim Basinger.  Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys, bullets, cops who don't like him, swamps, crawfish, and cajons(sp?) all to a hip 80's soundtrack.\nThis film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it's credit it is better than there second film, Final Analysis.  However there really isn't much going on here.  The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock.  Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce's(the director) fault because they fall in and out of their accents.  I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films, like this one, he is still fun to watch.  The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.\nThis film has it's momments, but they are pretty sparse.  Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together.

{"text": "I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.", "label": 0}

So I see the movie and it is looking good except the graphic parts and half-way It starts to sink that what the director Luc Besson intended is his biased view of events. I then google and it confirmed my suspicions, In LEFTIST Rag \"Le Monde\" He is as quoted as saying Joan Of Arc Should have followed the commandments if she is a true Christian ,Thou Shalt Not Kill\"and quote. Although he fails to realize it's Thou Shalt not Commit Murder. In fact there is such a thing as a Just War and Self Defense is covered as well. Murder is a different story,So you get another Liberal Trying to rewrite history and make Joan Of Arc look crazy. The French Adore Joan Of Arc and for Good Reason,she wasn't crazy. As for the Acting, I thought John Malkovich was great, and The Battle Scenes are good even if they are not ACCURATE by a longshot,and certainly you see why The English and French hate each other(The English Protestant wackjobs who would later rather Follow Henry and his Hideous Girl and Become Anglican-a Mutated Form of Catholicism),this movie is entertainment not historical,I will look elsewhere for A Joan Of Arc movie perhaps it will not be such a Special Effects Bonaza but I want to see a less biased movie.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This film, while good, just doesn't tell the same tale that its namesake novel did. The film includes the bare bones of the original story, yet little in the way of its power and grace, mostly because far too much is cut out and replaced with the romance that was mainly subplot in the book. The novel was not a romance so much as the telling of a life, whereas the film is a romance with the man's life story used as a reason for the lovers to meet and fall in love. I feel that this is yet another film that makes the mistake of assuming that the viewer has already read the book. Far too many films based on novels do that, and while in this particular film the assumption doesn't completely ruin it, its still a bad thing.\n\nWhat is mainly, and I feel, sadly, missing are Tom's (the main character)flashbacks of his childhood. Whereas in the book we are shown so many beautiful, terrible, and awe-inspiring scenes of this man's past, those scenes are reduced to a mere handful in the film. These flashbacks are so very important to the story that without them, there's something and obviously missing. The viewer who hasn't read the book won't really know what they're missing, but they should feel it. We never really get to know Luke, the strong and wild older brother, beyond two or three scenes of violence. A beautiful and painful scene from the book, where Luke and Tom go to New York to see their sister Savannah, is sorely missing here. It shows us that Luke is truly gentle and caring, not really meant for or understanding the cruelty of the world. We also miss an integral scene about a Jewish neighbor that explains why Savannah pretends to be Jewish, and shows her kindness and empathy. His death, a major plot element in the novel, is barely touched upon in the film. I also feel that the way the role of Luke's tiger was pared down was wrong. The tiger represented Luke's wildness, his fearlessness, and again, showed his discomfort with humanity. Luke would rather have been with the tiger that he understood than man. I'm trying not to spoil the novel for those who haven't read it, but the tiger played a much, much larger part in the novel.\n\nThe cast redeemed much of the film for me. If it hadn't been excellent, I think this film would have bombed. Nick Nolte did a fabulous job portraying Tom's special mix of wit and simplicity, his sense of humor, and his deep, deep pain. He caused me to fall in love with Tom as Susan did. Barbara Streisand was also great as Susan Lownstein. If she wasn't, I don't think I could have watched the film, since she was given so much screen time. Melinda Dillon as Savannah was perfect, giving us the feeling of fragility, madness, talent and grace that was evident in the novel; Kate Nelligan as Tom and Savannah's selfish, grasping mother was excellent, and Blythe Danner was also great, though not used enough.\n\nMy major gripe with the film was the gross enlargement of Susan's (Savannah's psychiatrist, played by Barbara Streisand, and who also directed and produced the film) part and her relationship with Tom. It just wasn't that important in the novel, though I don't think I would have minded it if it wasn't there in place of Tom's flashbacks and his relationship with his siblings. I didn't really want the film to be a romance, and that's what is. It's not bad, but it's not \"The Prince of Tides\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil is the kind of movie I like to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  Or any night of the week after 11pm when I'm too tired to think anymore.  It's like watching a really cool video game without all the work of actually playing it.\nI loved this movie!  Based on the video game of the same name, it gives you all the zombie killing fun that I can only assume the game does (I've never played it but I've seen commercials for it on T.V.)\nIn the secret underground lab of the Umbrella Corporation, illegal genetic and chemical weapons experiments are being conducted.  One of the experimental agents is released in the facility and the A.I. enhanced super-computer that monitors the lab decides that the only way to contain the \"accident\" is to lock down the building and terminate the hundreds of researchers who have been exposed.  The company then sends in a special forces team to disable the computer and discover the reason for the disaster.  Once inside the team discovers that the A.I. is in control, the researchers have all become flesh eating zombies and  the genetic experiments have broken out of their cages.\nMilla Jovovich, aka Leeloo from The Fifth Element, plays Alice, a special forces agent in a sexy evening gown with short term amnesia, who is found in the house above the lab complex and taken in with the team to secure the facility.  The only other actor of name is Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight, The Fast and the Furious) as one of the special forces soldiers.  Both women do a great job of running around blasting zombies and acting cool.\nThe special effects are really good.  The zombies are your basic slow moving, ever advancing, impossible to kill without a head shot variety.  The mutated killer dogs are scary and look real, but the CGI genetic mutants are disappointing.  Kinda like the stone warriors from the based on a video game movie Tomb Raider.  The 3-D computer maps of the facility that pop up periodically to show you where the characters are is a neat effect as well.\nI was very pleased with this movie.  It was exactly what I expected it to be and the perfect waste of a Saturday afternoon.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Ever since I first read Jane Eyre years ago, it has been one of my favorite books, with its complex characters and wonderful writing.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie, however, was either completely unfamiliar with the book or thought they could do a better job than Charlotte Bronte.  Virtually none of the dialogue is from the book, and when they do keep something (like Rochester's wonderful line about the string connecting him to Jane), it's butchered.  If I weren't already familiar with the plot (or, rather, with how the plot should be), I would've been very confused by the choppiness of this movie, especially towards the end.  For example, Jane hears Rochester calling her name, the next minute she's in a carriage, and the next minute she's at Thornfield.  Wow, that was fast!\n\nJane's stay with St. John (who is much too nice in his proposal to her) and Diana is reduced to about five minutes, and her aunt's death is completely skipped over.  No mention at all is made of Jane's inheritance from her uncle, or of her family connections to the Rivers family.  Oh, and when Jane and Rochester go shopping in town, they run into Blanche Ingram, for some inexplicable reason.  Of course no movie can keep everything from the book, but this one simply butchered the plot.\n\nAnd it butchered the characters as well.  Rochester is not supposed to continually bellow and snarl at Jane in the way Ciaran Hinds does in this movie.  (He was such a good Wentworth in Persuasion, I think the fault must lie with the director and script -- very disappointing.)  Nor is Rochester supposed to be a lust-crazed maniac who yells at Jane when she's leaving him, \"You want me!  I can feel your passions are aroused!  Say you want me!  SAY IT!\"  He literally bellows at Jane all through this scene -- like when he shouts, \"Didn't I just know you'd desert me!  Really, Jane, you are SO PREDICTABLE!  Couldn't you be just a little more original?!...You're just a child who has NO IDEA WHAT REAL LOVE IS!\"  And I use the capital letters because that's how the lines were spoken -- or rather, screamed.  It was impossible to see why any woman in her right mind would fall in love with this Rochester!  This aspect of the film, along with the awful script, made it difficult for me to finish watching the movie.\n\nAs for Samantha Morton, she was generally all right, but she overplays the spirited, independent part of Jane's character to the point of being downright rude to Rochester from time to time.  Still, at least her performance was less painful to watch than Ciaran Hinds'.  To summarize, the script and plot bore virtually no resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's original, and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester was a snarling bully, making this movie almost laughably bad.\n\nIf you want a good adapatation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  Yes, Dalton is too handsome to be a good Rochester physically, but more important than that is his performance, which shows the many facets of Rochester's personality -- not just non-stop anger.  The plot is kept intact (including the famous gypsy scene, which is omitted from this movie), and almost all of the dialogue is straight from the book.  I'll have to re-read the book and re-watch that adaptation of it to purge this movie from my memory!", "label": 0}
{"text": "Taking five years to research and produce, this 1979 film is meticulous in its recreation of the time of Jesus. It uses over 200 locations in the Holy Land, many actors from the region, and is based on portions of the Gospel of Luke.\nThis is the film used by over 1,500 denominations and missions to evangelize, and it has been translated into 877 languages and shown to over five billion people in 228 countries, and is an excellent \"tool\" for this purpose, because it is simple and at the same time very powerful and moving.\n\nBritish actor Brian Deacon is a wonderful Jesus, with a soft but manly voice and perfect enunciation, making the words of Jesus come to life in a very special way.\nOthers of note are Niko Nitai as Simon Peter, Rivka Neuman as Mary, Talia Shapira as Mary Magdalene, and the part of John the Baptist (played by Eli Cohen) is short, but physically the closest I have seen on film to what I imagine the real John looked like.\nRichard Kiley narrates as Luke, and also listed as narrator is Alexander Scourby.\nDirected by John Kirsh and Peter Sykes, it has some terrific passages; one of my favorites is the storm at sea (Luke 8:22-25), which is very effective, and the cinematography by Mike Reed, and the locations, a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe film ends with an invitation to salvation, and with it the promise of \"a full, abundant life, filled with purpose and meaning\", and with a quote from Revelation 3:20: \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him\".\nTotal running time is 83 minutes.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The Jesus Film is truly a phenomenon and great tool for reaching many people to understand the Jesus that is described in the Gospel of Luke.  The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.\n\nThe Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBrian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.\n\nMany of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).\n\nWhat is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.\n\nThere are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:\n\nBesides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.\n\nThere is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.\n\nEven though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.\n\nI bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  I highly recommend this film, along with \"The Gospel of John.\"", "label": 1}

I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIR\ntime so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.\n\nSeemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!\n\nOkay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it!

Nothing else was one so I decided to watch\nit. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.\n\nI could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived \"slicker guy\" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.\n\nThere are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?\n\nDespite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!\n\nIf you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!\n\nIs this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit!\nIs this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!\n\nP.

Sarah Michelle Gellar not only looks anorexic and anemic, but her performance is likewise uninspired.  Her years on Buffy may have convinced her that her presence alone is worth a viewer's interest, but I was really surprised at her lackluster participation.  Jason Behr as her boyfriend Doug seemed to be infected with this apathy as well.

{"text": "Resident Evil will probably never win any awards for subtly, acting or writing but it does satisfy the urge to watch an interesting horror movie. The original game was really a knock off of the concept from a number of previous movies (Night of the Living Dead, Warning Sign among many others). It's lack of originality is more than made up for with an imaginative production design and nicely paced narrative.\nThe plot is as simple as the game. There's dangerous research going on in the Hive. Someone has stolen a lethal virus that turns whomever it kills into flesh eating zombies. A crew is sent in to discover what's happened to the Hive when the computer shuts it down killing the infected staff of 500 workers.\nIt's clear that Paul Anderson's film owes a huge debt to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. While George Romero chose to inject an element of savage satire into his trio of films, Anderson plays his film as a straight ahead thriller. There's lots of close ups of gruesome things. The most clever and original element in this film is making the persona of the central computer into a little girl.\nThis isn't anything heartwarming or original about Resident Evil but it's a fun thrill ride for fans of the original game. It's a pity that Anderson chose not to add any additional subtext to the film as it would have given him and his performers more to work with given the thin narrative. This superbit edition has improved resolution (particularly noticable on a progressive DVD player and HDTV) when compared to the previous, regular editon. Is it worth buying again and paying more money for? Frankly, given the film itself probably not. It's not a surprise to see this film released in the superbit format (vs. more deserving films)as Hollywood has learning to fleece customers many times for \"new improved\" product.", "label": 2}

The acting was believable and convincing, the settings LOOKED like Turkey (I know, I've been there) and the soundtrack was pretty good.\n\nBut on the other hand, it bothered me that this movie's trying to make me feel sympathy for someone who did a crime. In my opinion, he broke the law, therefore he got what he deserved. SOL pal!\n\nIt also appeared to me that this movie is trying to show \"US=good\" and \"Turkey=bad\". How irresponsible can people get? If you've paid any attention to current events, guess what? Turkey is now showing a movie called \"Valley of the Wolves\", in which Americans are demonized in the Iraq war. Supposedly it's a big hit over there in Turkey. Hmmm, I wonder why.\n\nI vacationed in Turkey in 2005, and personally, I had a GREAT time. Turks are indeed hospitable (thanks for all the \"tourist tea\"!). Not surprisingly, I did not see ONE American tour group. I was with a German one. Even the Japanese vacation in Turkey! But apparently not too many Americans. Hmmm, again, I wonder why.\n\nA bit of advice if you're planning on going overseas and want to avoid that one-in-a-million chance of getting into the sort of prison this movie depicts:\n\n1) TRY to learn the language\n\n2) Blend in (don't wear your \"Proud to be American\" shirt over there\n\n3) Respect/follow their customs\n\n4) Don't do anything stupid (like smuggle Hashish).\n\nIf you want to watch a movie about a terrible prison with a lot more merit to it (and also based on a true story, to boot), then I HIGHLY recommend \"Papillon\" and also the book by the same title by Henri Charriere.", "label": 2}

{"text": "...on it's own, standard Hollywood fare. Don't go into this expecting a faithful take of the original \"Resident Evil\" game; that storyline was tossed out the window, with director Paul Anderson inserting his own cookie-cutter vision (lack of vision?), looking to cash in on the franchise name.\nAnderson, in the liner notes, is called a \"fan\" of the RE video game series. Coulda fooled me, since his big-screen adaptation hardly has anything to do with RE. For whatever reason (ego? studio execs with zero inspiration beyond $$$?), Anderson decided to script his own \"prequel\" to the events of the first RE game. The game was a slow-paced creepfest, all about atmosphere. This film is typical Hollywood tripe, full of kung-fu babes, lame one-liners, wooden acting, obnoxiously-loud industrial metal music, and cheap \"things popping out of lockers\" scares.\nThe basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering & genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat & shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A \"crack\" SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her \"Matrix\" routine....you get the point.\nAnderson turned a great game series into a convoluted mess. There is no \"Red Queen\" killer computer in the game. No underground office workers. No Alice the Zombie Killer. The script is paper-thin. Here's a great example; Team Leader: \"Report, soldier.\" Jovovich as Alice: \"What?\". Good stuff, eh? Michelle Rodriguez will make you wonder how she gets paid to act, irritating you beynd belief in the process. She plays a Vazquez-from-Aliens ripoff character, snarling the entire movie in an effort to play a tough commando chick. The rest? Uh, doesn't matter since you barely even learn any of their names. Bad zombie effects, mediocre CGI work (including some zombies), blasting music....meant as a distraction, I believe, from the awful screenplay.\nThere's no crumbling Spencer Mansion. No odd puzzles to solve. No lone zombie wandering a dark hallway. No mouldering tombs to search. No blackened catacombs. No Trevor family. No freak mutations like the massive snake Yawn, Plant 42, Lisa Trevor, the shark Momma Neptune, or the dreaded Tyrant. No moody atmosphere of being stranded in a remote mansion, looking for your missing comrades without a clue as to what happened. No horror of discovering sinister experiments. In fact, there's nothing in this movie that made the game so creepy and effective. It was all there; perfect source material to make a truly frightening film. Sadly, it was all trashed in favor of pretty actors and lame Matrix-like action. In other words, Hollywood took another promising franchise and turned it into the typical garbage that they churn out day after day. On it's own, the film is your average Hollywood action/horror job, indistinguishable from the rest of its ilk. As a RE film, it is a complete bomb & miserable failure.\nWant a great RE movie experience? Buy a GameCube and the Resident Evil remake. The graphics are amazing, and the mood is perfect. Play it in the dark and you start looking over your shoulder. Want a bad RE movie experience? Pop this film into your DVD player and you start looking over your shoulder for the nearest exit.

For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.\n\nHowever, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.\n\nOh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.\n\nOther then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.

{"text": "RESIDENT EVIL is one of those movies you go into knowing that you won't get much out of other than a little dumb fun.  Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.

She announces she is pregnant just as he announces he plans to travel for an indefinite period of time. The passion between Newland (Day-Lewis) and Olenska is represented well on-screen, and you can feel the sadness and their never seeing one another again after May, Ryder's character, has children.

{"text": "Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express.  Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect.  [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision].  Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans.  Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained.  Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada).  To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').\n\nInstead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts.  It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie.  Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice.  The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil.  They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied.  There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture.  Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen.  Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film.  The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone.  Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.\n\nThe differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \"true story\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims.  Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\" and, \"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\"", "label": 2}

{"text": "Idle hands is hopefully at the end of a cycle of horror flixs that was started in 1996 by Scream, a satire of the slasher pictures of the 70s. Like all cycles in the movie business, this one has been brought down by the weight of too many cheap and derivative knockoffs When this happens, it finally doesn't matter if a movie in the category is good or not. People don't buy it. Ironically, the next big cycle was kicked off this summer by another, albeit more sophisticated and serious, horror genre - the psychological horror / ghost story [The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense]. Idle Hands is further handicapped by being neither one of the best nor one of the worst of the \"scream\" cycle.\nIt starts off well enough. The time is Halloween. What other time is there? Young Anton's parents retire to bed. After the lights go out, they see an ominous message written on the ceiling. All hell breaks loose, and this sequence unspools like a twisted situation comedy. The next morning, Anton [Devon Sewa] wakes up, oblivious to the fact that his parents have gone missing. But then the teenager is oblivious to almost everything except drugs, sex and rock and roll, as are his two best friends, Mick and Pnub [Seth Green and Elden Ratliff]. As the day progress, it becomes apparent that one of Anton's hands has taken on a mind of its own. It has become homicidal. Most of the funniest moments in the movie show the boy and his deranged hand fighting for control. Devon Sewa, like Jim Carrey, is a very physical actor.\nIdle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes.\nThe bigger problem is that every character is self-centered and stupid. The writer and the director do not understand that, even when a movie is a horror satire, if the audience cannot relate to any character, interest quickly wanes. One morning Anton discovers his parents have been whacked, and, by that night, he's trying to make it with the girl next door. You can laugh at this idiot, but do you really care about him? This is not to say that there are no clever scenes in the movie. It is to say that the audience's involvement remains superficial. It's one of those pictures that leaves no impact and is forgotten by the next day.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Not that Crime and Punishment was happy but the film and the book are undeniably similar. From the isolation felt by the protagonists, to the heroic child prostitutes.\n\n The film is compelling there is no doubt of that but is that a good thing? With a book like Crime and Punishment where the character murders, the author at least shows the consequences of such a deed both inwardly and in the world.\n\n With Taxi Driver the climax is the violence, it is the insanity. An insane man saying 'you talking to me' is cool and funny. Travis is the hero, an insane man who murders and tries to assasinate people is looked up to and idolized. Thats a hallmark of Scorcese films and why I don't like a lot of his work. He shows the seductiveness and romanticism of satanic actions and people, but brings too much sympathy to them, too much idolization. Instead of showing the real consequences of these dark impulses, Scorsese seems to be infatuated with them and splashes them pornographically across the screen for his own amusement.\n\n This film is seductive yes, but certainly unhealthy.", "label": 0}

{"text": "First, let's clear up one fact, this is NOT Claymation. It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.\nThis fact aside, \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.\nAll the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.\nThe songs are excellent, from the familiar \"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\" to the lovely \"My World Is Beginning Today\" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)\nThe script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.\nThis has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show.

{"text": "If you are unfamiliar with the incredible Resident Evil video games, watching this movie won't make you want to try them out.  And if you're a fan them, like myself, you're going to be set up for extreme disappointment.\nFirst of all, there's not much here in common with the games, other than zombies and an occasional mention of the T-virus or some other phrase from the games.  Secondly, there is nothing frightening about this movie.  Unlike the games, all the instances of violence/gore/shock come across as very campy rather than scary.  Actually, \"campy\" may be the wrong word to use, as that would imply a bit of lightheartedness- this movie takes itself *way* too seriously.\nYou feel very little tension or buildup while watching, and you'll find yourself looking at the packaging halfway through to find out what the running time is.  It's just plain boring.  And of course, there's a setup for a sequel no one is asking them to make.\nThe only impressive thing about this film is the performance of lead actress Milla Jovovich, who seems to be the only involved in the movie who realizes this is based on a VIDEO GAME, not Shakespeare.  She did a great job considering the quality of the movie.  On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez gives an eye-rollingly melodramatic performance as the token \"tough chick.\"  The other actors either just stand around, get killed, or most likely, both.\nBut who knows, maybe the upcoming sequel will be better.

The elves are unable to get their product, toys, to town. When Santa grows up, he decides that he has to make the trip to town, but first he has to go through the territory of the winter warlock (socialism-regulation). Meanwhile, in town, the Burgermeister-who rules the town with all the zest of a communist dictator, has outlawed toys and set mandatory labor for all the kids in town (how commie of him). When Santa gets to town, he befriends the town schoolteacher (education) and is branded an outlaw for giving out toys (how capitalist of him).

{"text": "If two great film artists, Carl-Theodore Dreyer and Robert Bresson, saw fit to restrict their talents to Joan of Arc's \"passion\" and \"trial,\" then what on earth Luc Bresson thought he could do with  her whole story is sheer megalomania.  An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.  Viewers  should purchase the newly restored and gloriously remastered Passion of  Joan of Arc to get glimpses of what art can do with the enigma of Joan.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Like far too many films these days, \"The Deep End of the Ocean\" begins promisingly then collapses midway under the crushing weight of heavyhanded plot mechanics, incredibility and sentimentality. The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family.\nMichelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional \"horror\" film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable.\nAs months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his \"true\" parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.", "label": 0}

The plot was almost laughable, it had nothing to do with RE games, but I'm sure that the \"movie makers\" had good reason for this.  The characters weren't developed, I only really felt sorry for Michelle Rodriguez, she was the star of the show.  She was \"hot\" in many scenes with her tom-boyish approach in the movie.  She was the only one the cracked any jokes in this movie.  Milla Jovovich was good, she looked reallll good in clothing that barely covered her.  Thats one reason why I saw the movie.

{"text": "The virus that turned the inhabitants of the Hive into flesh eating zombies has now made it's way through Raccoon City turning the cities inhabitants into...well, flesh eating zombies. The city has been quarantined. No one is able to leave or enter. However, the few that have yet been affected by the virus are not without hope as long as they have Alice.\n\nMilla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking heroine from the 2002 hit, Resident Evil. She has become stronger and more aware of her abilities. Unfortunately, so has her enemies. Umbrella has released their newest weapon into the city - Nemesis. Nemesis is a hulking abomination that has his eyes set on the S.T.A.R.S team and on Alice.\n\nThis movie leaves the confines of the Hive, and takes to the streets of Raccoon City. While the areas are dark and definitely spooky, the suspense is killed by how open they are. One of the biggest draws of Resident Evil was the claustrophobia inducing corridors. The characters never knew what was around the corner, and they had little time to react or maneuver when they found out. You simply never get this feeling with Apocalypse. Suspense has been replaced with action. What you are  left with is a decent action zombie movie with little resembling the Resident Evil tone and mood.\n\nWith action playing a greater role, the pacing has quickened quite a bit with frequent explosions, shootouts, and hand to hand combat. I believe more with this movie than any other, Milla secured her title of the \"Female Arnold Schwarzenegger\". She really gives the big guy from Austria a run for his money when it comes to being a kick butt action star.\n\nThis is nothing really groundbreaking with the special features - commentaries, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc. As usual, the better commentary track comes from the filmmakers rather than the cast.\n\nPicture quality is not bad, but it's not a real looker either. My biggest complaint is with the skewed black levels. It looks a bit bright which hurts the contrast in darker scenes of which 98% of the movie is composed of. Colors are generally good, but nothing really pops. It is disappointing, but not necessarily a deal breaker. Sound quality is excellent. With a good surround sound setup, the groans of the undead will put the hair on the back of your neck at attention.\n\nOverall, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not Resident Evil. The suspenseful mystique of the 2002 film has been lost, and replaced with something that more resembles a summer blockbuster. Fans of the Resident Evil universe will still find enough to keep them entertained, but this movie definitely won't change the minds of those on the fence.\n\nTech Specs\nVideo: 1080p, 2.40:1\nAudio: English LPCM 5.1, English Dolby Digital 5.1\nSubtitles: English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese", "label": 2}

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.\n\nUnder dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.\n\nVarious facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!\n\nDetermined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.\n\nWhether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.", "label": 1}

The \"Hunters\" in the video-game version kicked butt totally, with their pumped-up bodies and bad attitute, were as in the film (this has to be the cheapest idea I've ever heard), they are actually \"Lickers\" evolved...where ...did that come from???  The CGI in this film is absolutely terrible.  It looks like it was done on a home computer!!!  The characters are terribly one-dimensional and have no purpose...either than to be eaten alive by monsters.  What really ticked me off was the fact that some characters in the film get close to death in one scene that is very pulse-pounding, survive, only to be mutalated anti-climatically 10 minutes later.  It was as if the director was sitting in his chair and constantly his assistant would come up to him and ask \"So...do we kill him now?\" and he would say \"Nah, better wait a few more minutes\".  This was totally annoying.  I absolutely hated Jovovich's character for her lack of common sense.  Ofcourse, these days, if you want to make a action film, gotta put in stupid \"Matrix\"-style moves.  God, am I getting sick of that same formula of action!!!!  How is it that you can jump against a wall and kick a dog in mid-air motion?  Please!  Probably the worse thing by far in this flick was the ending......", "label": 0}
{"text": "This is a high-energy youth angst movie, set in 1980s Salt Lake City. Matthew Lillard is Stevo, protagonist punk and narrator. The movie basically tracks his post-college life in SLC as he tries to define just  who the hell he is, along with his long-time buddy, Heroin Bob (who's one of the only characters with even an iota of credibility to him, especially when stacked up with Stevo -- incidentally, the Steve-o from \"Jackass\" and \"Wildboyz\" is infinitely more hardcore than Lillard's Stevo -- hell, for the little poserkids out there, watch \"Jackass\" to get a better understanding of it!)\n\nWithout  wanting to spoil much of this movie, because it really is a lot of fun, I  have to say that I think that Stevo's father IS the screenwriter, and he's  confronting his younger self in this movie, and reconciling his lifestyle  choices. There are patchwork references to anarchism and punk throughout  this movie, but for anybody who knows about either of these areas, it's  clear that the writer doesn't get it. How do I put this: it's a punk movie  for posers, or for people who don't know jack about punk.\n\nHow do I know  this? Well, it's clear that Stevo is a shirtsleeve rebel from the start;  only people who put a lot of faith in appearances and lifestyles could  possibly believe he's anything but that (I mean, he mall-rants at length about how US hardcore is so much better than UK punk, but their punky party van has the Subhumans and PiL spraypainted on it -- hello??)\n\nAll the punk stereotypes/cliches appear in  this movie - dyed hair, mohawks, leather jackets, and so forth. But anybody  who really gets punk should know that there isn't a look to it, not if  you're for real - nobody should look like a punk, or look like an  anarchist; punk was about anti-fashion, about genuine nonconformity, about  being yourself; anarchism is about self-expression and liberation. This is only practiced by two of the characters, and is pointed out by another. The  rest are charlatans, and they don't even know it. I blame the screenwriter for \"Cashing In\" on punk's popularity at the time.\n\nBecause I knew Stevo was full of (sh)it from the beginning, his journey's end came as no surprise to  me, his \"revelation\" wasn't revelatory. Still, it's an enjoyable  journey, anyway. The soundtrack of this movie is excellent, despite the movie it's wrapped around.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I think this film is great for its entertainment value.  Jeff Daniels puts forth an excellent performance as General Washington, and the direction and editing do an excellent job of building suspense during the crossing of the Delaware River.  Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself concerned about the ultimate success of the mission.  That being said, the portrayal of Henry Knox does a diservice to the father of American artillery.  While John Glover and his men did yeomens'work during the crossing, Knox commanded the operation.  It was through his efforts as a leader, working in concert with Glover, that the Americans succeeded in their task. The movie disparages his achievement for comedic effect.  Overall, I recommend this film, but watch it after reading David Hackett Fischer's \"Washington's Crossing\" or David McCullough's \"1776\".", "label": 2}

I couldn't really sense too much of a theme from the movie because the character analyses seemed to be too vague in order for you to completely understand their dynamic nature.  The ending, for instance, shocked me.  I didn't really see it coming, especially since there was hardly any time for the main characters to reflect upon the action that had taken place, and left me without a sense of closure.

Andrea is treated by her supporting characters like some goddess when, if you really look at the persona she presents during the flick to her on screen friends and love interests, she isn't all that unique.  I will say that Andrea's thinking process, brought to the viewer through frequent voice overs, brought to light a girl almost completely different than the girl she showed, one witty and fiery and a complete individual.

{"text": "This adaptation of the marvelous novel \"Jane Eyre\" was an absolute punishment to watch. Such artistic liberties were taken with the characters in this film as to render them virtually unrecognizable. I can't recall any of the dialogue that was actually true to the book, and this was very disappointing as the strength of the story lies in the voices of the characters. I have no doubt that Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds would have done a marvelous job in their roles, were it not for the horrid writing and equally horrid direction. Mr. Rochester is so continually flying into a rage over something or other, that one wonders how Jane ever could have tolerated his company. And Jane speaks her mind in a much more opinionated and argumentative way then Charlotte Bronte ever allowed her to in the book. I also wonder why some of the most important scenes were completely ignored. Basically all of Jane's childhood is passed over in about 5 minutes, and thus the foundation of Jane's character cannot be truly understood. Also, the deathbed scene of Aunt Reed, and all the particulars of that family were passed over. And the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy, one of the most revealing and pivotal scenes in the story, was completely excluded. I would not recommend this film to anyone who has never read the book, as it simply does not do it justice. I also would not recommend it to any true lovers of this tale, as it is more likely to frustrate than to entertain.", "label": 0}

{"text": "If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson's `The Messenger: The  Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile  wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous  stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually  generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those  mind-boggling historical incredibilities.\nJoan was, of course, the  deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed  were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a  glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army -  managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the  field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle  experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.  We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety,  attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of  ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and,  eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape  and murder of her beloved older sister. We see the French royalty, so  driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the  brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this  child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into  what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories. But glory  is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it  is gained - and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of  restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no  longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by  the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for  the crime of witchcraft.\nGiven this fascinating and astonishing series  of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in  interest and insight. And, indeed, `The Messenger' is, perhaps, a better  film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would  indicate. The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of  the tale. The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant  adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all  these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the  film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to  apply some psychological depth to the character. After a particularly  sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and  limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair  over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight. From then on, her actions  arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her  being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic  teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her  trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder  whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an  obsession for personal glory and power. We're a long way from the astute  psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the  story, `The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc,' but `The Messenger' does take  occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the  question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention  or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion  borne of insanity. Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of  Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as  she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this  otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly  familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out  of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud -  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the  stake. Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the  film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not  arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.\nIn terms of  dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable  Hobson's Choice: should the writers employ language that reflects the  reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated  by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more  modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also  possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that  weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the  elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of  `The Messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading  to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and  `I'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter  word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could  ever do without.\nThose with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence  had best be forewarned: the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited,  register high on the bloodletting scale.\nOf the performers, none matches  in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that  adorn the film. Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving  more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles  occurring at the root of her personality. John Malkovich, as the would-be  French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his  moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film  to allow him to create a multifaceted performance. Faye Dunaway brings a  cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative  mother-in-law.\n`The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying  mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story  to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews  that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.", "label": 2}
{"text": "\"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" is nothing more than a by-the-numbers film created with liberal use of \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Directing the Medeival Epic.\" I have been vastly entertained by director Luc Besson's work in the past, but this film is a plodding, gore-drenched nod toward Mel Gibson's vastly superior \"Braveheart.\" \"The Messenger\" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. \"The Messenger\" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic (and more convincing). Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holier-than-thou manner. The film's topics are interesting (was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?), but the execution is poor. On top of this, the scripting and dialogue is just plain bad. If you want an epic, I suggest looking elsewhere. Maybe somebody out there will make a better picture about this fascinating historic figure.", "label": 0}

{"text": "What to say about RESIDENT EVIL? Well, the film's director, Paul Anderson, is probably one of the most hated directors in Internet land and while I don't hold as harsh of an opinion on the man as many do, I still don't think he's anything great and I definitely don't think he is qualified to direct his next feature, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR. Anyway, that's beside the point. How did Anderson do with the adaptation of one of the most popular video games of all time? Unlike its video game turned big screen adventure predecessor TOMB RAIDER, RESIDENT EVIL isn't a total waste. However, at the same time, for as much action and danger as the story tells us is going on during the film we don't really see all that much happen.\n What RESIDENT EVIL does well though is the way it thrusts us into what we are able to see happening. In the first five minutes, several people are dead and we are introduced to the lovely and very naked Milla Jovovich who stars as the films lead character, Alice. Granted, RESIDENT EVIL doesn't break any new ground whatsoever with the things it shows us. The things we see throughout the film are actually borrowed from several other movies ranging everywhere from DAWN OF THE DEAD to ALIENS to that Bridget Fonda LA FEMME NIKITA movie. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch them again does it?\n I admittedly don't know that much about the video games of RESIDENT EVIL other than the fact that I know there are zombies in them so I don't know if the film is faithful to the video game or not. What I do know is that as shallow as it is, I had a pretty good time watching RESIDENT EVIL. While the film may be brain dead, it's still fun, popcorn munching entertainment.\nC+", "label": 2}
{"text": "\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,\" if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.\nThe movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too.\nAnyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. \"This is our version of winter,\" says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously.\nThe movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, \"This is such a good film,\" because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot.\nNothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here?\nAnd what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.\nI had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress.\nIn watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, \"People are actually going to like this.\" Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those \"in-crowd\" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Some fans of the Resident Evil video game complained that the film was not true to the game; I have never played the game, so I can't comment on that, but in a sense such a criticism is neither here nor there. It's more important to know that Resident Evil is as much an homage to George Romero films as it is to its video game origins, although I am sure many tried and true Romero fans won't like Resident Evil for its somewhat poor and certainly imitative borrowing of Romero's zombie ideas. Resident Evil doesn't stop there, as it borrows from other sci-fi and horror films; the method the Red Queen uses to kill several characters trapped in a corridor is lifted right out of the low-budget, cult favorite (and successfully eerie) film Cube. Paul Anderson is a talented filmmaker, to be sure, and Resident Evil is a slick looking film with sparkling clear photography. Anderson's screenplay isn't as simplistic as one might expect from this type of movie and it proceeds through a series of flashbacks to tell part of it story. Milla Jovovich, whose energy, presence, and looks always out-pace her acting, is just the type of actress to play Alice. Add to that the nice touch of giving the Red Queen the voice of a young British girl, and you have a film that rises above mediocrity ... even if it never really impresses.\nIt doesn't help this film that zombie movies in general are difficult to take seriously these days, unless the zombies are tounge-in-cheek. But Resident Evil is fun and slightly scary. Just remember that this is derivative, not original, filmmaking and that you too can own this DVD for less than full price.

{"text": "We just got done watching this movie in my literature class because we read the book. I must say that when I started the book I didn`t have a very open mind; the very beginning of the story seems a little trivial and is certainly not the most exciting point of the story. When I`d been through about six chapters I wasn`t enjoying it, though I`d read worse. But we watched the first forty minutes of this movie and I was fascinated by the eerie, dark mood it portrayed. Watching this version definitely helped me to enjoy the book from then on. Dickens really did do an excellent job of setting the mood and the dark atmospere in \"Great Expectations\", and whoever made this movie knew the right way to show the same mood on film. I think the creators of this movie also knew the book genuinely inside and out, which is what I infer from the phenomenal choice of cast members. The actors chosen to play both the young and older Pip, Abel Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Jaggers, and Wemmick were all simply perfect for the roles. In fact, all the actors were extremely fitting, except the one actress who played Estella - she wasn`t neccesarily the way I`d imagined the grown-up Estella to be like, at least, but she did carry out the part well enough. There is some dialogue and a few scenes at the end that stray a little far from the book, but the ending was the one thing I wasn`t neccesarily satisfied with in the book anyway. I think I even like the ending in this movie better.", "label": 2}

The eerie mansion backdrop of the video game is completely absent instead replaced by an over stylized laboratory and the basic premise of the game (survival horror) is thrown out of the window.\nInstead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs!\nThe best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings.

If I were one of her soldiers, I wouldn't be  inspired by her at all to fight for France.  Rather, the English looked  more like those civilised type.  With due respect, Milla is not a bad  actress after seeing her in the Fifth Element & her minor role as the  prostitute in You've Got Game with Denzel Washington.

{"text": "Resident Evil: Apocalypse (Alexander Witt, 2004)\n\nResident Evil: Apocalypse may be Alexander Witt's first directorial credit, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more than enough experience under his belt to direct an action flick. His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.\n\nThen you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b. Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.\n\nUnfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.\n\nGiven that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ", "label": 2}

{"text": "There have been rumors of a Resident Evil movie since the release of the second videogame in 1998, but it hasn't happened until now. Originally, George Romero, the director of the original \"Night of the Living Dead\" wrote a script completely identicle to the story of the first videogame. Later, I discovered Romero's script had been canned and that Paul Anderson, director of \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Event Horizon\" was responsible for the project. Naturally and suspectingly, this movie became another cash-in, completely ignoring the original story of Resident Evil. Even though I paid to see it in theaters on opening day, I was still sketchy about this movie. As it turned out, this movie had completely failed all my expectation, leaving me dumbfounded as to why I had even considered seeing it. This movie was another excuse to cash in on the videogame-turned-movie basis, filled with useless CG effects that have no real place in the film. The story and script is full of holes, and the one-liners get fairly annoying. As a real fan of the Resident Evil videogames, I'd recommend other die-hard gamers to only watch this movie warned that there isn't anything good to expect. But to all the movie-going public unaware of Resident Evil, enjoy this cash-in movie.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I liked the first \"Resident Evil\" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.\n\nThe Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.\n\nAlice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the \"easy\" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the \"Resident Evil\" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.\n\nI understand that there are a lot of things in \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" that are lifted from the various \"Resident Evil\" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a \"Spider-Man\" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.\n\nTaking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.", "label": 2}

There was no rape scene (of her sister), and Joan was never without conviction regarding her supernatural experiences---and she used this quality well, being actually in command of the entire French army. Motivated by the Holy Spirit, she was never hysterical as is Milla Jovovich's character--frequently. Her \"conscience\", played by Dustin Hoffman was really a part Satan would relish as this character spread as much depression and suicidal hopelessness as it did sparse and dubious counsel. The direction of the film was extremely well done, as the scenes virtually leapt right out of the screen. The choreographic aspects of the scenes were also outstanding. These two dynamics were the two standout points of the film. The acting was also in the standout category with Jovovich taking the lead. A pity it is that a proper theological genesis was not applied to the screenplay; a vicarious fulfillment that would have made the film great rather than somewhat reminiscent of so many demoniacal matinees. The musical score was also outstanding but not all original, using or imitating at least one cut from Einhorn's Voices of Light, the original composition created for Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc.", "label": 2}

In that way, Easy Rider offered some groovy music (the subset  which was made available for the soundtrack), drug themes, trite  counterculture, ...  And they didn't use sexual themes really at all to  sell it.\nThe characters, notably Hopper's, are thoroughly unlikable and I  find it funny how many people align with the film but would have to force  any real identification with the lead characters.\nFonda's \"we blew  it\" summation near the end hits on a variety of levels: their  filmmaking, the disillusioned culture that closed the 60s, as well as the  obvious plot direction.  The editing is abyssmal.  But there is a certain  charm in it all.

As a longhair  of the times, I can say that it does remind that being a longhair at the  time wasn't so hip to most people.\nAlso, Phil Spector as the connection  at the beginning is a bizarre (in a good way) touch.\nI think just about  anyone should see this movie.  Make up your own minds.  But take off the  rose-coloured glasses first.", "label": 2}

Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.

Soon \"ghosts\"- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his \"value system\" ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.

The original movie was excellent, don't see the need of any re-editing. I believe it's about money as Steven Spielberg's most movies are. Close Encounters was his last film as a director with innocent creativity that brought great movies like Duel, Sugarland Express, Jaws and Close Encounters. From my point of view, the new ending did hurt the movie.  The original one was very satisfying, presented just enough and left much more for our imagination. Obviously Spielberg wanted to re-done this movie in his in \"cheesed up, at times childish, big bang Hollywood style\" which is evident in duds like ET (artistically), Hook (financially).Just leave Close Encounters alone, perhaps make another ET (hope not)if he feels the need for more alien, sci-fi flicks.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I saw this movie went it first came out in the late '70's and I have to say, it seems sillier now, and somehow less scary, than it did then.  However, I love the premise of \"Eyes of Laura Mars\".  Faye Dunaway plays a stressed-out, highly successful fashion photographer who starts seeing the commission of violent murders through the eyes of a particularly vicious killer. When he starts targeting her friends, Laura Mars suddenly realizes that she's also on the killer's list, and probably the one person who can stop him/her.  It's an Americanized version of the Italian giallo genre, and it almost works.  Faye Dunaway is wonderfully neurotic as the glamorous, high-strung Laura Mars; she has a world-weary beauty and pent-up energy that fairly snaps when she's onscreen (which is often; she's in almost every scene)--you can't take your eyes off her.  A young and ruggedly handsome Tommy Lee Jones is on hand as the key detective on the case, and a potential suitor for Laura.  Jones had a charisma even in \"Eyes of Laura Mars\", although I feel that, with his Texas accent and homely good looks, he's miscast as a veteran New York City police detective.  The rest of the cast does a credible job, particularly Brad Dourif, in another creepy role, this time as Laura's ex-con driver, and Rene Auberjonois, as her edgy, chain-smoking manager.  Raul Julia, also surprisingly young and fresh-looking, appears (mostly as male eye candy) as Laura's conniving ex-husband, and Darlanne Fluegel and Lisa Taylor are fun as two of Laura's models, and potential victims for the killer.\n\nThe cinematography is sufficiently flashy to convey the decadence of the world inhabited by Laura Mars and her crowd.  However, the muted, autumnal colors of Laura's wardrobe seem to be at variance with this world--she should have chic, brightly colored clothing, not the dreadful, ill-fitting costumes that were apparently designed by Theoni Aldredge for this movie.\n\nAlthough well-directed by Irvin Kirschner, a screenplay partially penned by John Carpenter, and a song performed by Barbra Streisand (producer Jon Peters was her boyfriend at the time), \"Eyes of Laura Mars\" ultimately falls on its face by the time it reaches it's contrived and predictable  ending.  However, the first three-quarters of the film are good enough to make this film one worth owning.", "label": 2}

Luc Besson's interpretation of the legendary historical figure is visually impressive and the battle sequences are bloody and exciting.  Unfortunately, the story is muddled, the film is pretentious, and scenes meant to come across as deep sometimes come across as goofy and campy.  Good performances across the map, with Jovovich faring quite well in a rather maniacal portrayal.  Mostly middling material, with occasional excellence.

{"text": "Similiarities to the Enemy Mine movie could be made here. Perhaps the Enemy Mine writer got the idea from this story. Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case. As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island. They try to kill each other at first. As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible. SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending. You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience. Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me. Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending. Still well worth owning.", "label": 2}

So I relented and eagerly viewed the DVD, only to berate myself for having been duped.\n\nBriefly - \"Taxi Driver\" is the story of Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine turned NYC cab driver; a young man who \"means well\" but is a macho character with s*** for brains (kind of like the creators of this movie, I'm sorry to say). Anyone who hasn't sense enough not to take a woman to a smutty movie loses my interest and sympathy pretty quickly. Bickle is his own worst enemy; he doesn't have the patience or wherewithal to apply himself to get educated, etc. to make life better for himself and others. He just wants life to improve, NOW! OK, sure. So he instigates some bloodshed and death, and somehow sometime winds up a sort-of hero. HUH?\n\nI tried to get some insight on the HUH? part by viewing the \"documentary\" section of the DVD, but I just couldn't muddle all the way through it. It was full of nothing but ego-driven minutiae; details about stuff no sane person would care about (yawn), so I gave up and will happily dispatch the DVD back to the Public Library today and wash my hands of it.

It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.\n\nThis film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.\n\nAlthough I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.\n\nThe only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.\n\nOverall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.", "label": 1}

Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.\n\nThat afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!\n\nOnce the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of \"what she did\" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.\n\nOverall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying \"I know what you did last Summer\"; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer gets a B+ in terms of gore and kills but the movie overall deserves a C - or maybe even a D", "label": 2}

While nowhere near the debute of Orson Welles, Allen shows considerable comic promise as he attempts to translate his wierd and wild though shyly neurotic stage act onto the silver screen.\nFirst of all, this movie is hilarious.  No doubt about it, Allen's mockumentary about a looser con is top-notch comedy.  Allen's use of gags are endless (re. glasses, rabbis, soap gun, etc).  They are well-deployed and brilliant.  Allen's dialogue is equally funny, the best line in the film being, \"After twenty minutes, I had decided I wanted to spend my entire life with her.  And after a half hour, I'd given up the idea of takin her purse\".\nYet, in his first film our schlemiel of a director is bound to run into difficulties.  At times it appears he is trying to hard to be funny.  Forced humor never works, and it works even less in Allen's case.  Some jokes just seem overdone.

However, it's better remembered for the fourteen songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, many of which became Sinatra standards. Written by Dorothy Kingsley, the rather slight story has the crooner play womanizing nightclub singer Joey Evans who keeps losing jobs because cad that he is, he likes to fool around with married women. Joey lands in San Francisco and finagles his way into a job as singer and emcee at a dive called the Barbary Coast. There he meets innocent Linda English from Albuquerque, a chorine who refuses to strip and just wants to be a torch singer. In typical Sinatra swinging fashion, Joey flirts with her but plays hard-to-get. One night, both are recruited for a charity show held at a posh Nob Hill mansion. The hostess is Vera Simpson, a former striptease performer who has since become a wealthy society matron. Sparks fly between Joey and Vera but only after mutual acts of humiliation. He breezily moves in with her on her yacht, and she decides to fund his pipe dream, owning a sophisticated nightspot she dubs \"Chez Joey\". Never one to leave his cards on the table, Joey hires Linda to sing, and you can guess the rest as the inevitable romantic triangle takes the expected turns.\n\nDirected by George Sidney (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Anchors-Aweigh/dp/B00002E223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Anchors Aweigh</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Viva-Las-Vegas/dp/B000QUUD56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Viva Las Vegas</a>), it plays out rather lugubriously with nary a surprise, but the songs are mostly gems. Sinatra knows how to play heels, though Joey never gets hard-boiled enough to develop a true edge. On the upside, he sings \"There's a Small Hotel\", \"I Could Write a Book\" and best of all, \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" to a guardedly smitten Rita Hayworth well cast as Vera. Even though at 38, she was actually younger than Sinatra, she cuts a coolish (and shapely) figure as a jealous patroness despite the unflattering camera angles. It's just a shame that the story doesn't respect her character much, especially at the very end. However, when she literally lets her hair down, it's a relief to see her old seductive self in post-coital bliss as she lip-syncs \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\" (sung seductively by Jo Ann Greer). As Linda, Kim Novak - a year away from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vertigo/dp/0783226055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;- fares less well as she looks tentative and oddly blank-faced during her big number, \"My Funny Valentine\" (sung sonorously by Trudy Erwin). But we all know it's really Sinatra we want to see perform, and from that respect, a lot of the movie plays out like one of his 1960's TV specials. The only extras on the 1999 DVD are a couple of trailers and talent files for the principals. An intermittent entertainment, it's definitely a product of a bygone era.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought \"Gattaca\" after seeing the excerpt from what turns out to be the start of the movie, in PBS's \"Nova\" program.  Folks design their offspring and get the USDA seal of approval on their genetic sequence.  Thus is the entrance to the great machine of identification and authentication made, and the outsiders are simply not \"valid\".  I guess I could live with less of the sensational action and further elaboration on the science, but then I'm an admitted geek from the get-go.  The aura of this film is very much like what we saw in the screen version of \"Fahrenheit 451\"; that of a world you know has gone nuts, with some obsession that is supposed to be the end all for public safety and social harmony.  Folks will wind up, in the world of \"Gattaca\", with an identification about as impersonal as an ear-tag appended to a factory-farmed meat animal, but a lot more telling.  I shudder to imagine that the much-maligned delusions behind eugenics, made so popular earlier in the last century, will create such a bunch of cretins as the two fellows who conspire to fool...not mother nature, but Big Brother himself.  One really has to wonder, in all of this, which is the better cause--one's comfort or one's innate conscience.  \"Gattaca\" works the best it can with its premise, only by the time it gets fully laid down, we're just dealing with another story of a fugitive for whom we're supposed to cheer.  There are steep and awesome precipices in the idea of genetic authentication, and the movie gives us some idea of them.  But is not evolution just like that, and equally dramatic?  It would seem that we're enacting our own set of challanges, then sending out intentional mutations that are supposed to win.  Yes, this is all suggested, but what we principally have is an attempt at a cliffhanger flight.  The subject matter of our protagonists' interpretation of propriety, however, is just another struggle of the freedom-fighter ilk.  It is a little too focused on the lead characters, leaving a lot left to do with a very profound topic.  It would seem, in the human intervention at hand, that ontogeny truly recapitulates philogeny, only the ontology is hardly able to account for the impossible number of original interventions that took place during the philology.  Wherever a crime is comitted, evidence remains.  I would have liked to have seen a better treatment of the ultimate crime behind this society's proclamation of what is good and what is not.", "label": 2}

The story isn't absorbing enough.  There are some other faults as well.\n\nThe battle scenes are unbelievable.  A number of times we have one solitary fighter, either Takezo or his friend, beating off a large number of attackers.  The way this is accomplished is by showing the hero spinning around, and every time he swings his sword, someone else falls.  It is absurd.  The men fell, in turn, because the script told them to.  There is no realism in any of the battle scenes.\n\nWe also don't understand why the characters behave as they do.  We just have to chalk it up to Japanese culture, or whatever.  They make no sense as real people.  Why did the priest treat Takezo as he did?  Ya got me!  Why did Takezo make the final decision he made?  Ya got me again.  I don't feel it.\n\nIn one scene, darling Otsu tells Takezo to wait for him, and she disappears to change her clothes.  Obviously he was going to walk out on her.  I thought Otsu was an absolute idiot for walking away to change her clothes, after begging him to let her accompany him.  Do you think he stayed and waited for her?  How foolish was that scene.\n\nIt is a fairly absorbing story, but not nearly as absorbing as the book Musashi.  I can't give this film more than 3 stars.\n\nOne thing that annoys me in Amazon reviews is how often people say \"the movie was great but the dvd was bad\".  It is a cliche already.  Rate the movie.

{"text": "I've never read Dickens, or watched any movies/tv series based on any his novels, so I don't know what is from the book and what is from the movie director. I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:\n1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:\n2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.\nI mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?\n3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?\nI give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.", "label": 0}

This time, it's an entire city that's being brought down by a virus invested population instead of a claustrophobic high tech lab.\n\nA recap voice over given by Alice (in Wonderland?), played by Milla Jovovich gives the update we need even if we had released what little emotional attachment we had to the first one.  I give high kudos for the creators in making a movie that actually surpasses the first one in production value and action thrills.  The first was more of a suspense movie, which is fine because the suspense of what they discovered in the first one is gone.  We know what they are up against.\n\nThis one is actually more like the video game, an action shoot-em-up where the popular characters come together to fight the `Evil'.  I'm not familiar with the characters from the game but I was intrigued when I saw Jill Valentine smoke up the screen.  Nothing better then to put a hot female cop in a mini skirt, black go-go boots and corset with guns strapped to her hips.  Hello Nurse!\n\nAnyway, the situation in the movie goes from bad to worse as the virus catches up with almost all the characters introduced.  Only a few remain at the end and the finale is actually pretty impressive with a shameless introduction for a third installment.

You've probably seen it half-a-dozen times already, and on DVD  it's just as funny as it is on VHS, but with a slightly nicer picture and a  smaller box. That's pretty much all you get, too - the wonderful Criterion  version of 'Life of Brian' is a taster of what can be done with DVD, and  the lack of extras makes this less interesting. What sets the film itself  apart from the competition (not that there is any) is the attention to  detail, the desire to create a stylish portrayal of medieval England on a  minute budget (less than a quarter of a million dollars, in fact). It works  well - location footage in Scotland and lots and lots of smoke give the  production an 'Exclaibur'-esque look of grim and gritty reality, and this  is what sticks in the mind after the film is over. It's extremely funny,  but you know that already - as with all Python, you can watch it again and  again, spotting lines and performances you hadn't noticed beforehand. Given  that no special effort has been put into the presentation, and given that  'Holy Grail' is hardly THX material anyway, you'd probably be better off  with the standard VHS version.

I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).\n\nNow we have \"Resident Evil- Apocalypse\".  Don't get to see \"grown-up\" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of \"made-for-cable\" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.\n\nBut wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.\n\nCinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first \"Star Wars\" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not \"Lucas-Time\").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!\n\nI can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.

Milla Jovovich is pretty good as  the lead character, always boisterous and impulsive, but at the same time  understandable.  While the dialogue was a little drab (the audience is  always one step ahead--we know what the characters are going to say), and  the movie drags a little, it is more than made up for by the sheer epic  feeling you feel when the camera takes you in the heat of those battles.

As  the crisis approached and once the climbers were webbed in it, the  consequences of decisions and habits begun long ago became magnified and a  true tragedy unfolded.

Each climber was both.  But, this movie sketched simplistic portrayals and so the depth and  complexity of the story is lost.  The movie has its compelling moments:  Rob Hall and Jan Arnold naming their baby, soon to be born; the effects of  high altitude on the climbers' minds and breathing; the fierceness of the  storm.

And shamefully the talented Gary Oldman, Glenn Close,  and Jurgen Prochnow are not allowed to show off their skills.\n\nThe plot (Air Force One being hijacked by Russian terrorists) seems easy enough.  However, the linchpin of the whole plot is completely ignored, thereby invalidating the whole movie.  For the terrorist plot to succeed, it is completely dependent on one of the secret service agents to be a traitor.  Did he do it for money? power? sex? a good chocolate milkshake?  We'll never know because they don't bother to mention it!  So we're supposed to accept that a president will run around Air Force One beating up terrorists, but a secret service agent who would have to endure YEARS of training, screening, and background checks would turn on the commander-in-chief with no good explanation?  Also do we really want a president who would consider the life of his family over the well-being of the nation?

Having said that, I must warn fans to take this movie for what it is- an action movie with similar monsters and the same city.  The movie is loosely based on the game, there are no characters from the game, the mansion lab has been replaced by \"the Hive\" (a lab buried deep under Raccoon City, more in common with the 2nd and 3rd games).  So, once I turned off the RE fan boy inside and gave up on the hope that this would be a faithful representation of some of the finest games in the world, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience.  However some problems are inherent with the movie itself.  The villainous Red Queen seems to have conflicting motivations from scene to scene.  At times she seems to be merely enacting protocol, other times she seems to be playing a malevolent game with the lives of innocents.  The zombies, other than a couple instances, are uninspired.  Unlike the game where the people have had time to rot and are sufficiently dead-looking, these look merely like people that don't get out much.  The special effects are hard to believe, especially the Licker.  It doesn't look convincing, or even reasonably scary (a Hunter would have been a more suitable monster, if not several Hunters).  The fight seen between Milla and the Dogs is forgettable, and stupid.  Finally, the obligatory femme fatale SWAT team member, that takes no guff and shows no fear, is both contrived and offensive.  Otherwise, Resident Evil is an entertaining, if uninspired movie with more in common with Aliens than the game from which it recieves it's title.  I suggest you check it out.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I have been playing forms of rock/metal for a few years, but never really tried my hand at leads so I figured I would give this vid a shot.  I watched the video through a few times and obviously Paul is very good at what he teaches, but I got left in the dust right off the bat.  I eventually decided to focus on some of the easier patterns, memorize them and run though them everytime i pick up my guitar.  I am a lot faster now than before I started, but still nothing close to paul---even on the simple ones.  I would say this video is more for someone that can already play fairly fast and is either looking for more licks or wants to play faster.

I wasn't hopeful but I decided to give Scorsese one last chance.  Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Taking out the Dead, all left me cold, bored and a little angry.  Taxi Driver was just as bad.  I've tried to understand why.  So many people absolutely love Scorscese movies that there must be something there.  In this case I'm blaming the score.  It calls attention to itself relentlessly.  It does not disappear behind the images and contribute to creating the mood and tone.  It stands between me and the images and seems to want to take me in a different direction, like it's incongruous with the film.  My ears were in a lounge listening to experimental jazz while my mind was watching an excellent character study with something to say about the nature of life.  I wonder if I could enjoy this movie with a different score, and I wonder if maybe that was my problem with the other movies as well?", "label": 0}

Although Kraukaer's book of the same name seemed to show some biases and quick, sometimes scathing one sided judgements of people, no one can say that he is not an excellent and captivating writer.  In this movie, the poor script itself, would (or should) make him cringe.  There is little basis for fact in the movie as well:  Kraukaer was not the first to summit, he did not man the radio from camp once down to talk to Rob Hall...etc, etc, etc.  I wanted to watch the movie because I had read in Anatoli Boukreev's book The Climb how disturbed Boukveev was when he saw the movie on TV the night it was first played.  I am sorry that he had to suffer with this....and that he thought that this was how Americans would \"see\" the tragedy.

Can't wait to see it\" It was a big dissapointment when I finaly saw  it. First of all it completely destroyed the brilliant ending of the first  part. I think it should have been better connected instead of just being  explained as a nightmare. The character of Julie James is still pretty  interesting but all of the new characters are pale  in comparison. There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first. The producers just thought  \"bloodier equals better\" I guess but that just isn't the case.  The ending is a ridiculous repetition of the ending of the first one and I  hope this doesn't mean there's going to be another sequel. If you like  seeing Jennifer Love-Hewitt and a lot of blood then this movie isn't too  bad after all but if you're looking for believeable characters and a clever  story line you're gonna be dissapointed.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Resident Evil makes its way onto the big screen after all the times of having games on since the PlayStation since 1996.  While the movie you'd think it would go about following the first movie, but instead it's more of a prequel to the first game.  One of the things that I like about the movie, is that with the camera angles they make the movie feel like if it was a game but in a live action kind of way.  Although the story itself, does go about trying to give the fans, something new to look forward to and not a movie where everyone is going to know what's going to happen next.  Milla Jovovich, plays as `Alice' who from the start of the movie doesn't know who she is or what she did, though her memory starts coming in towards the end of the movie thus proving to be a nice story to the Resident Evil.  By the end of the movie, there'll be a bit of a twist although at the same time you'll recognize that something big is going to be set up for the next movie.  Some of the features that they have in this DVD are nice to see how the transition from game to movie was done.  Overall I give this 3.5 stars out of 5.", "label": 2}

Then Charley sees a strange sight at night - one neighbor is a vampire! He tells his friends and the police, but who believes in vampire legends today? Charley seems to be a crank. The local TV station has old horror movies from long ago. This show is called \"Fright Night\". The host is Peter Vincent, a former actor. Charley contacts the host of this show because he knows how to fight vampires. [You won't find \"Vampire Killers\" listed in your local Yellow Pages.]\n\nAnd so the story runs on about ridding the neighborhood of these undesirable characters. The police can't help, there is no zoning law against vampires in that city. [What about your town?] There is a complication with Charley's girlfriend. Will Amy be attacked and bitten to turn her into a vampire? If so, can she be saved by killing that vampire before sundown? There is a lot of scary action. Can Peter Vincent succeed in killing that vampire, like he did on those old shows? Of course, the good guys win in the end.

After seeing and, consequently, being disappointed in the first Resident Evil, I debated about seeing \"Apocalypse\" up until today. Having finally watched it, I am now qualified to write a review.\n\nFirstly, the lack of Claire and Leon is moderately distressing. I watched the entire first movie wondering if Milla Jovavich was supposed to be Claire or Jill. Seeing as her name is Alice, the mystery deepens.\n\nThe action was decent, though highly unrealistic when correlated with game play. I know, I know, I'm being a nerdy purist, but the fact is, Alice kicks much ass with her hands and legs....have you ever tried killing one of those damn zombies with your handy dandy Bowie knife when you blew all your magnum bullets on the dogs? I think the game ends right there. Too much kung foo, and out of focus too.\n\nI understand a man's need to see girls in skimpy clothing and even blow some heads off and do a somersault over a motorcycle, but this is ridiculous. Jill's top would TOTALLY have buckled like a belt about 80 times during the film. She even had a bit more on in the game!!\n\nBut I digress. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, I'm just saying more people would find it more irritating if they had heard Milla Jovavich sing. Not quite the badass now, eh?

{"text": "AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.\n\nAfter the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. \"It's your turn to live in fear,\" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.\n\nAir Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.\n\nIt turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.\n\nThese kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: \"You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?\" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.\n\nWolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.\n\nAs I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?", "label": 2}

Where the first movie had a relentless ambiance of terror, Apocalypse is a juiced up action horror without much horror.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This review contains spoilers, but that's sort of like saying \"water might be wet\"--everything I explain here is painfully obvious from the start of the film.  So read at your own risk, but you're not risking much...\n\nWhere we last left Alice, she and the other survivor of the movie, Matt Addison (Eric Mabius), were captured by the evil Umbrella Corporation for experimentation.  When she awoke, nobody was left alive in the hospital (shades of 28 Days Later).  So Alice does what she always does in an uncertain situation...she grabs a shotgun.\n\nMeanwhile, the entire city has been infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon that 1) mutates Alice into a superhuman killing machine, 2) turns poor Matt into Nemesis, a muscle-bound gun-toting juggernaut, 3) turns people into zombies, 4) turns dogs into zombies, 5) allows a little girl (Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur) to walk, 6) did I mention it turns people into zombies?\n\nSo what does Umbrella do?  What all authorities do in a zombie movie: they seal off Raccoon City and call in the nukes (shades of Return of the Living Dead).\n\nAlso running about trapped in the city is a cast of stereotypes: the hot police chick (Jill Valentine, played by Sienna Guillory who fails miserably at disguising her British accent), the hot military dude (Carlos Olivera, played by Oded Fehr), and the funny black guy who swears a lot (L.J., played by Mike Epps).  After lots of grandstanding, swearing, amazingly accurate zombie head shots, and a lot of confusion, the plot finally gets going when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) gives them a mission.\n\nUsing his amazing \"personnel locator\" that only seems to work for Dr. Ashford, he discovers that Angie is holed up in her school, all by herself.  We're not sure exactly how this is possible, but never you mind...what matters is Ashford hacks into the entire Raccoon City network and is able to view what's going on from every video camera and microphone.  He then calls our heroes with a deal: if they agree to get his little girl out of the city, he will tell them how to escape.\n\nThe means of escape is through a helicopter.  That's it.  That's the big plan.  Hijack a helicopter.  But of course, it's all a trap, and ultimately Alice and Nemesis must duke it out...for some reason.  Something about the perfect weapon, yadda yadda.\n\nThere are a lot of neat graphical touches throughout the film.  Alice's bullets have little Umbrella Corp. icons on them.  The helicopters are painted with the Umbrella Corp. logo.  And the end of the film (and subsequent cover-up of the nuclear blast) is entertaining in the same way that the rise of a zombie outbreak was entertaining in Shaun of the Dead.  Which is to say it's awful, but you enjoy it anyway.\n\nBut that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.\n\nThere's a lot of slow motion action sequences, a lot of blue lensing, and a lot of freeze-frame shots of weapons dropping to the ground. The director (Alexander Witt) is new to directing a film on his own.  He doesn't seem to know what to do with Paul W.S. Anderson's script, and it shows.\n\nThe movie drags on and on and on long after it should end, such that it feels a lot like you're watching the third film (an inevitability).  By that time I had lost interest.  When the most interesting part of a film is Jill Valentine's miniskirt, it's hard to care about Alice's fate.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have always had a keen interest in zombie moviesand horror films and have spent time watching some of George A Romearo's classics such as night of the living dead etc.. Resident Evil is a movie trying to get out of its shell, it has the potential to be a great movie with some tweaks. As I watched the movie and it quite frequently kept jumping from place to place giving no real focus on ceratin parts of the film, not giving you time to settle. No real description of the chracters was given at the start of the movie, and it wasn't until half-way through you finally really found out what was going on. On the good side this film did offer some good scare factors with some well crafted zombie sceanes and fancy lazer rooms (if not seen before) Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do a good job as the lead roles in this film and play there parts well. I did see this film before it comes out in the UK and I will see in the cinema before I pass my final judgement.\nThe main point I really have to make is resident evil doesn't go out of its way to shock you do death with gore, unlike George A Romearo's Dawn of the dead and day of the dead sequal's to the very good night of the living dead, which did have a genuine scare factor. Dawn of the dead and day of the dead are fairly OK films but George Romearo just slapped them with gore and expected you to be scared, I was basically discussed. Those films were a far cry from such comedy classics such as Braindead, which I think is banned in America (shame on you). Anyway i'm getting away from the point if you like zombie films go see Resident evil, if you love films with a fantastic story and amazing acting this film is not for you. Ignor some of the patchy story and you will love it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This movie was not as good as the first one, but it is still worth watching. Instead of Gellar and Phillippe, Mekki Phifer and Brandy are added to the cast. I only gave this movie 3 stars because it sort of did too much on the killing and made it look unreal and unbelievable, it also left out too much of Freddie's Character only having him appear in certain points and at the end. It also didn't make sense how in the ending the gun all or a sudden was stocked with bullets. Despite all that it provides a good plot and characters that work well together, following Julie, Carla, Tyrell, and Will on a radio won trip to the Bahamas where their in for a wild ride, of course too make the story sensible that is the real home of the last movies killer ben willis, out to get them.

{"text": "April 23, 2000\nAs you know, Alan Parker is a director and Midnight Express, won two Academy Awards in 1978, was directed by him.  He said that this movie was his most effective movie.  Midnight Express was showed as  based on true story belonging to Billy Hayes and its lead player was Brad  Davis.  Sure, it directed by Alan Parker and written by Oliver Stone.  Shortly, the movie begins with Brad Davis' caught while he is smuggling  drugs out of T&uuml;rkiye.  Then he was sent to prison and he faced lots of  events out of humanity.  The most effective parts of the movie are these  torture scenes thought as horrible by the viewers.  We can see that  Midnight Express, caused many arguments about T&uuml;rkiye and Turks because of  these terrible scenes blame them.  In my opinion, these scenes were  exaggerated and especially included racism, so it does not depend on the  art principles that are to be international and uniting the nations.  Therefore, I can say that if I were Alan Parker with his knowledge and  experiments, I would make a better job for art and humanity than this  movie.\n____If I were Alan Parker, firstly I would start to change this  wrong thesis of the movie that 'This movie was adapted from a real story'  (?) because Billy Hayes, has the true story, said that this movie had been  changed a lot and exaggerated very much to make more effective.  So I ask  you that if I had not done that, how could I have been realistic and having  common sense director or human?  Secondly, I would continue to change the  general atmosphere that all of the people in the movie apart from main  character are sadist because this opinion causes to many prejudices about a  nation, Turks and this is not realistic.  So I would show the prison as  extremely instead of showing everything any parts of T&uuml;rkiye.  As you know,  every country can have these unexpected events but certain they are not  general because there is no systems whose aims are to hurt humans.  So I  would have caught a good point for discussing some prisons in T&uuml;rkiye.  Perhaps many actors and actress would have helped me to make the movie and  I could have used the real Turks on the movie instead of their fakes.  In  my opinion, that would have been more effective, more realistic and more  useful.  Thirdly, I would have used some of good character in Turks and  emphasize again that all Turks are not bad people, they have some problems  like all nations.  So I would have behaved universally and not do injustice  to lots of people live and lived friendly and fraternally in Anatolia.  Fourthly, perhaps the most important thing, I would have been sorry for  making mistakes because I could not have done all of them and turn my  movie, full of the prejudices and racism, to more objective and humanistic  way.\n____In my opinion, all of the people whose goals are to be universal  and uniting of whole humanity like art's would make better if they were  Alan Parker.  They never hurt any other nations in the world, Turks and  whose unique leader, Atat&uuml;rk who says 'Peace at home, peace in the world'  and presented April 23, written date of this essay, to all children in the  world as a symbol of peace and friendship.", "label": 0}

People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.\n\nThe other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.\n\nWe HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.

{"text": "Discrimination, nature-vs.-nuture, potential, drive... all fascinating issues, and all touched upon by Gattaca.\nBut when paired with a 'stylishly soulless' execution, the issues become as dull and lifeless as the characters that portray them.\nIn the film, love fizzles rather than sizzles.  Passion seems hardly passionate.  The main character has drive, but it's one more exposited than shone.\nAll of this together makes one think \"hmm\" rather than \"wow!\"  While this may be a \"thinking man's movie\" it succeeds only in suggesting broad themes to contemplate rather than coloring, twisting, accentuating, and tweaking aspects of the themes to get us to take the next step.\nAnd on a more superficial but no less frustrating level, I found it questionable that a firm like Gattaca would require DNA testing -- whether for identity or drug-free status verification -- on such a frequent basis.  With entrance into the facility already tightly controlled, what threat (post-murder environment aside) was so imminent that justified such a thwart in daily productivity?\nSPOILER!!!\n*\n*\n*\nAnd lastly, with regards to the murder... surely, some of the murderer's stature and access could have employed a much less blunt method of killing, no?  Poisoning, sniper rifle (via hitman), etc... all would have resulted in less risk of ultimate detection.\nIn a nutshell, then, Gattaca -- despite its noble trajectory -- is brought down by implausibility and a failure to examine critical issues raised in a more bold and deep manner.", "label": 2}

I did have to force myself to laugh at this scene and some others, so it wasn't that good. My advice is if you haven't seen it, and you want to see it, see if you can rent it first. If you like it then, by all means buy it. I didn't even like the extras that much except for the English subtitles. I have to have them on when I watch a DVD because the sound is sorta low on my DVD player even if I have the TV sound halfway up to the maximum. I doubt if I watch this anymore for awhile.

The movie was filled with impressive  action sequences, but that is not the reason people go out to see movies  anymore.  Take \"Wild Wild West\" for a recent example.  On the  defense for the movie, Gary Oldman does a good job as a POed pro-Soviet  Russian idealist tyring to free a profound Soviet officer from a Russian  prison.  That part is not far fetched.  There are quite a few profound  pro-Soviet factions in Russia.  Many of them have high powers in the  government.  The idea that the next in command leader of one of them can  manage to hijack Air Force One with the mysterious help of the Secret  Service (hmm...maybe his reason for joining them will be in the Special  Edition) is where the plot becomes ridiculous.

I ordered it out of curiosity because I had read how bad it was, and it did not disappoint!\n\nVery loosely based on Jon Krakauer's excellent book about his experiences as a member of Rob Hall's 1996 Everest expedition, this \"movie\" is poorly-acted, excruciatingly badly written, and has the most melodramatic musical score in the history of movie-making (the awful music swells alarmingly to announce each commercial break!)\n\nIt's also inaccurate, and is really an insult to the memories of some of the real-life participants in the tragedy.\n\nIt would be a shame if this TV garbage were your only introduction to, for example, Anatoly Boukreev (in the film the actors can't even pronounce his name right), who single-handedly kept the death toll during this awful night on Everest from being even worse than it was.\n\nI had read that Jon Krakauer was always embarrassed about this movie, and I don't blame him.  So save your money, your brain, and your sensibilities, and read or re-read \"Into Thin Air\", \"The Climb\", \"Left for Dead\", or any of the other books by the participants in the 1996 Everest tragedy.\n\nThis movie could not possibly be worse than it is!", "label": 0}

Instead, they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.\n\nOne expedition leader, the late Scott Fischer, comes across as a mellow, disorganized, bumbling dude. One of his expedition guides, the late Anatoli Boukreev, is depicted as a self centered, Neanderthal like he-man, who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.\n\nAnother expedition leader, the late Rob Hall, fares somewhat better, in that he is portrayed as an organized, stand up expedition leader, who puts the welfare of his clients above his own. His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.\n\nSocialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed, rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks. Texan Beck Weathers fares little better, as he is characterized as a buffoon. I am sure that, were he to see this movie, he would wish that they'd have left him on Everest.\n\nThe actor who plays Jon Krakauer's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus. He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie. He portrays Krakauer as a dour, humorless human being who, were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer, would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul. Last, but certainly not least, are the Sherpas, who are shown as wise, brave, put upon souls. Now here, the movie is hitting its mark.\n\nThe cinematography is laughable. Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest. Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume, waving banner like in the sky?\n\nLet me cut to the chase. Read the well written book upon which the movie is based, \"Into Thin Air\" by Jon Krakauer. Do not bother with this movie, unless, like me, you are an Everest junkie and a glutton for punishment.

Henry Winkler.\n\nThe Fonz makes an awful Scrooge, or Slade, in this case. His acting isn't horrible, but it's also not that good. There seems very little emotion in his transition from corrupt, hateful, \"covetous old sinner\" to changed man, learning to care for others. He's stiff and seemingly insincere. (His interaction with the young boy at the end is a little creepy too. \"You're going to come for a ride with me.\" Ew.)\n\nHis character is too old looking... it looks like he could kick the bucket any moment (yet he runs around like a man quite a bit younger), and caused a disconnect and confusion while visiting with The Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\nI mean, it's not horrible, but I certainly didn't like it as much as many of the other Christmas Carol adaptations out there.\n\nIf you're looking to watch A Christmas Carol, I recommend the George C. Scott version for a wonderfully sarcastic Ghost of Christmas Present who gives Scrooge a good dose of his own medicine (however, the scene with Ignorance and Want may be scary to children*), or A Muppet Christmas Carol for a surprisingly touching musical adaptation- I promise the songs aren't too hokey.

I realize that this movie is based in the Depression, and is based on the original comic, which had different social standards. But I still find the movie disturbing in ways that were completely over my head when I was 11.\n\n4. This movie is blatant capitalist propaganda. It openly worships money and power, and demonizes the poor. It even manages to make fun of communism.\n\n5. I was horrified to now understand the context in which the song \"Tomorrow\" was used - to encourage the President of the United States to distract poor people from paying attention to their situation.\n\n6. In this movie, money is always the solution, and people are essentially property.\n\n7. Besides being classist, the movie is sexist and racist.\n\n8.

If I wanted to see a fashion show, I would  have stayed home and turned on my cable.\nI absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.  His lines were stilted, he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was  doing, and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie.  Was  this supposed to happen?  I don't know.\nI do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.  Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time  Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit.\nThe special effects  were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie.  The bubbles  they walked in, those big mechanical bees, and the high-flying act at the  end were all pretty dang cool.  I just wanted more out of the characters.  I wanted more out of the plot.

First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.

{"text": "If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.\n\nThis obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.\n\nThese first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of \"White Rabbit\" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.\n\nIn short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.\n\nThis second film is, in my opinion, marginally better than the first film.  It feels less tied to the strict gameplay narrative that hobbled the first film.  On the other hand, I really didn't like the feel of Raccoon City in it.  It never really came to feel like a real place.  It just felt like a succession of sets, whether indoor or outdoor.  Contrast this with THE MATRIX, where the city of the construct felt much more alive and actual.\n\nI will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.", "label": 2}

At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.\nLet's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.\nApart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.\nI cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.\nI think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford.

With actors hired on location, jump cuts, improvisation, tripping camera guys, rock soundtrack, this is a pothead's tribute to Godard, Kerouac, and those who pursued,and missed, the American Dream.  Captain America and Billy don't represent freedom so much as the alternative culture's imitation of Big Time Capitalism.  \"We blew it,\" Captain America says. Evidently, lots of cultures \"blow it\" in this film:  The Anasazis, farmers--the film is littered with the wreckage of lost cultures.  The commune where the guys grab lunch shows the perils of self-absorption.  Clearly, the living-off-the land thing ain't easy even if Captain America admires it.  There's lots of eco-porn here.  The camera gives us too many panoramic shots of purple mountains' majesty.  Woodstock is over; the Age of Aquarius offered little but grass-fueled talk about Porky Pig. Billy and CA, like Butch and Sundance, are relics of an age gone by. Not so much an age but an over-exposed blip on the screen.  The idealism of trust-fund hippies hasn't worked out. On to the 70s!

In the 1770s they still used that word to refer to a donkey. And we still have a copy of Washington's orders that his troops were to refrain from profanity.

{"text": "I am a Turkish citizen with a great love of cinema.  I myself am an amateur film maker.  Like many of my Turkish friends, I liked this movie as a film production.  All the good film making elements had their good ways into this cult film, such as strong performances, cinematography, music, etc.  However, what I find unforgivable for such great film makers, like Alan Parker, Oliver Stone, David Putnam is the fact that they have been a part of a great propoganda for anti-Turkish view.  I don't believe that such avid film makers of Hollywood circle would naively didn't realise this attempt.  It is so obvious that some rich lobbies funded this film as a sheer anti-Turkish propoganda, and very successfully used such names.  This, in my view, is a black stain on all.  I would have respected it highly if they were to use both side's view on the film, and remain totally unbiased to the matter.  For once, there is no Turkish player in the film, not even a decent dubbing artists, who would have eliminated those highly visible broken Turkish accents of non-Turkish actors or dubbers.\n\nThe film starts portraying a very negative side of Turkey, showing some crude elements of Istanbul, as if Istanbul is a harsh and unforgiving Islamic town from mid ages.  Then the film moves into the tragic story of Bill Hayes, who got caught smuggling hashish or some kind of drug, which I don't know, because I never dealt with them.  The movie is full of terrible torturing scenes of a so-called Turkish prison, totally created from the twisted memories of Hayes in Malta.  I never have been prisoned, so I have no way of knowing how true was the Turkish prisons at that time.  I bet that they were not much different than of those in Greece, or US, or even from UK.  The actors playing the so-called Turkish figures, like lawyer, judge, attorney, spoke a very very broken Turkish language, full of spoken grammer mistakes.  Even the sets were created with a fanaticly anti-Turk view.  The scene where he curses to the entire Turkish nation, calling them and their mother all as \"pigs\" should be the creations of an angry anti-Turk than an acclaimed writer like Stone.  The film would probably look much nicer without such ultra-fanatic scenes.\n\nThe real story of the film was that Bill Hayes was helped for his escape by an officer in American consulate, who was an old lady, working at the Istanbul consulate.  I met her when I was working at the consulate during my college years in mid 80s.  She constructed (probably a well planned strategy with the helps of some political powers) a plan, by which Hayes was taken by the official boat of American consulate (known as Hiawatha) from the semi-open prison at one of the islands of Istanbul, and taken to Greece, and then to US.  Even at this account, Hayes was given a sort of privilidge at his stay in the prison to stay at one of the relatively comfortable prisons of Istanbul.\n\nAs I said, I liked the film, as a movie, but, I would still criticise the film makers by being tools for such propoganda makers.  Oliver Stone himself came to Turkey recently and apologised for his mistake.  So, apart from this huge shame on the filmmakers' side, there is one scene, which is probably the closest to the most reality. That was the scene, where Hayes was going thru the security of the airport, and the acting of the policemen was just great.  Apart from these, if you keep this reality in mind while watching, the rest is a very nice film on screen, not a close reality of what you would see in Istanbul.  Oh, by the way, don't mess with any kind of drugs anyways.  You might get into some kind of trouble for fact.  And, for a bit of advice, don't mess with the Turkish police.  You might get into their bad side for once, and......", "label": 2}

{"text": "(...)\nThe story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.\n\nLuc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.\n\nMilla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.\n\nThe battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.\n\nBeyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a revisioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.\n\nWhat we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.\n\n(...)", "label": 0}

{"text": "In reading of most reviews for this movie it is to majority consensus that Milla Jovovich portrayed Joan of Arc as if she were a raving lunatic, as if leading an army and a revolution were an easy task for a nineteen year old girl. Most reviews state that historical accuracy had been distorted, (granted the rape scene has no historical backing, and that King Charles was actually much younger than portrayed) but to imply that Joan of Arc had easily accomplished her god sent tasks would be not only a distortion of historical accuracy but also a discredit to all of her feats, it would be foolish to say that she hadn't been affected by the stress of war, not being a formal military leader and relying on her faith to bring her to victory.\n\n  I found Dustin Hoffman's performance to be nothing short of accurate in the terms of Joan's conscience and possibly the devil himself. The movie's bleak ending seems in my opinion to be plausible, when considering that her Army believed in her and did not question that she had been sent messages from god. It was only after her capture by the English that in her dark cell she began to question herself. And who wouldn't? It was the first time she had been so scrutinized. Nobody ever went into war believing that he/she was in wrong doing, and after her capture while on trial (if you can call it that) she was being questioned and after blindly following her beliefs into battle she no longer has support. Who without any support wouldn't question themselves?", "label": 2}

{"text": "To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.\n\nWhen Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.\n\nTo John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.\n\nThe Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.\n\nSo that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.\n\nThe casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.\n\nThere are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I really had to hunt to get all these, but I am seriously disappointed for 2 reasons. First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, \"HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me\". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.\n\nAnother problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.\n\nMy second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.\n\nI am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't.

After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much. However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.\nMilla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick. What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game.

The truly artful aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans... everything contributed to the sensory experience. Nice job. It's not Mozart, but it'll do.

{"text": "It's been some years since I've seen this film, and my feelings about it have changed.\n\nRichard LeGravenese's rich script (which rightly received an Oscar nomination) is ultimately undone by an ending that's sentimental to the point of being maudlin. We do not need to see Robin Williams directing his fellow patients singing \"How About You?\", nor do we need to see him and Jeff Bridges lying in Central Park watching fireworks.\n\nThe ending is so /excessively/ upbeat that it makes the darkness that preceded it seem a dream -- but it wasn't. The question of how Williams feels about Bridges' indirect responsibility for his wife's murder isn't addressed, nor is Bridge's need to ask for Williams' forgiveness. The \"happy-happy joy-joy\" ending seems designed to cover up these things.\n\nThe image quality of the Blu-ray is mediocre. One expects razor-sharpness (whether or not it's appropriate for the film); one does not get it here. The picture is (of course) significantly better than DVD-quality, but is still a bit \"soft around the edges\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "I must say, after watching this movie, I was looking forward to reading  some hilarious amazon reviews that would rip it to shreds....however, it  seems that most of the reviews were written by people that liked this  movie.  All in all, it was AWFUL!  The actors, some of whom did a fair job,  suffered from the terrible script.  Who wrote this movie anyway?  Most of  the dialogue was so unbelievably generic that it could have been written by  fifth graders.  I'm not really sure why Michelle Pfeiffer would waste her  time with this movie.  Unfortunately, she had to look as sad and vulnerable  as possible in nearly EVERY scene--this became OLD FAST.  Whoopie Goldberg  as an agent of the law?  Treat Williams, not a bad actor, also suffered  from his horrid lines.  I kept waiting for him to begin chasing Michelle  around the house with a butcher's knife yelling how it was really him that  planned the whole thing.  Then there's the oldest kid--all he does is WHINE  his dialogue throughout the movie.  And then there's Sam, the kid that was  lost for so many years...he looked as though he was quietly plotting the  demise of his biological family and just waiting for the right moment to  kill them all.  About the only role that didn't suck was the little girl,  who mysteriously disappears half way through the movie, never to be heard  from again.  And then there's the costumes and scenery.  I know this is  supposed to be suburban chicago, and I love movies set in Chicago, but the  wardrobe people apparently decided to dress everyone in the most cliched  suburban way possible, actually they look like they're modeling the new  fall wardrobe for some department store, and scenery....well you'll see  what I mean.  I haven't read the book, I must say, by the end of the movie,  it seems like the writers either forgot what they were writing about, or  the production ran out of money and had to end the movie the way it was.  Remarkably, the longest any dramatic tension is sustained is for about two  seconds, and any emotional interest in the characters is completely  non-existent by the end of the movie.  The chain of events throughout the  movie is nonsensical and ridiculous.  All in my opinion, of course.", "label": 0}

{"text": "As a huge fan of the novel, I was very excited to try and find a film that would do it justice.  I had read the amazon.com reviews of this particular version, and in spite of some severely negative opinions, I decided to give it a try anyhow.\nWell, let me just say to those with the poor reviews: \"I concur!!\"\nThe child actors who play young jane and young Adele are not good at all.  Additionally, the character Adele - who is SUPPOSED to be 10 - looks to be at least 12 year old!  It was ridiculous.\nSamantha Morton who portrays our heroine, Jane, does an fair job in the role.  She could have been a bit less attractive...yes, that's right, folks, just because a woman doesn't wear make-up and have a fancy hair-do doesn't necessarily make her unattractive!  Her portrayal of Jane was a little too impertenant.  Yes, Jane had spirit and professed her opinions honestly when asked, but the adult Jane was not openly confrontational and defiant in the way she was sometimes acted in this movie.  Her character was not done justice.\nCirian Hinds physically was a good Mr. Rochester, in my opinion.  He looked the part of the unattractive - even could be called ugly by some - large boned, tall man.  (I have seen him in \"Persuasion\" where is is the dashing Captain Wentworth, and looked purty darn hot I might add!  so kudos to his transforamation!) But it is a pity the likeness should end there.  He was made far too mean.  I don't remember him ever actually SCREAMING at Jane in the novel, yet he does it here frequently.  In the scene where they first meet, and Jane startles his horse, causing him to fall (they changed the setting and dialogue greatly in this scene by the way), he begins to scream at Jane, demanding and insisting she help him although she declines.\nIsn't this a bit backwards?  Was Jane not the one insisting upon helping Mr. Rochester in the book??!\nAnyhow, Mr. Rochester is a gruff, unpolished man towards her in the book, but they take it to extremes in the movie.  He is downright, plain old mean.\nAdditionally, his feelings towards Adele are much different than they are supposed to be.  In the book, of course, he is resentful of her presence and greatly irked by her.  He sends her away at every opportunity and never bestows her any real affection.  In the movie though, they have him asking for her, calling her to him, even setting her in his lap!  And, remember, this girl they have playing the supposed 10 year old Adele is more like 12 or 13!!  This makes for a fairly disturbing moment in itself!\nThey whiz through Jane's childhood with fair accuracy.  Condensing her childhood to being locked in the \"red room\" then being shipped away to school to face typhus.  It takes all of about 10 minutes for her to become 18 and leave to pursue her govenerss position.  Everything flies by you.  There are several scenes added in that are not in the book, but for the most part, it is done to provide the viewer background to better understand what is happening and why.  These scenes are basically dialogue between secondary charcters.\nThere is a scene where Mr. Rochester takes Jane into town to shop for the wedding clothes, and the run into Blanche Ingram.  That is the strangest addition - completely unnecessary, in my view!\nAnyhow, after the wedding is called off, and Jane resigns to leave Thornfield, there is about 10 minutes of completely made-up dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  He does, in the end, actually start screaming at her!  He screams at her to leave!\nNever - not in a million years! - would Mr. Rochester EVER tell Jane to leave!!  He even throws her bag after her!\nThey once again whiz through her three days of homeless wandering and begging, and her year spent with the Rivers's.  They completely leave out Maria Rivers's character altogether, and St. John is made a gregarious, pleasant, happy soul who smiles as he kindly asks Jane to marry him.  They pack all this into about 5 minutes.\nShe rushes back to Mr. Rochester after hearing him call to her on the wind, and about five minutes later it's all over, folks.\nAs far as some critizism of Mr. Rochester's healthy appearence at this point in the film (other than his blindness and mangled left hand - which was SUPPOSED to be gone altogether!), the book specifically notes Mr. Rochester is physically as strong and robust as he ever was.  Only his \"countenance\" has changed.  He is brooding and sad.  But physically, he is still strong and healthy looking. He is not supposed to look withered, sickly, and weak.  In that part, they again do Mr. Rochester physical justice.\nIn conclusion, the film may have been better had it been longer.  If they had more time to devote to the development of story lines, etc.  My other HUGE gripe is that they used SO LITTLE of Bronte's actual dialogue!!!  WHY???\nAND they left out some VERY important scenes!\nJust one example the springs to mind is the scene when Mr. Rochester is proposing to Jane.  So romantic, so climactic!  And yet, they not only use hardly ANY of the real dialogue, but the tree - the chestnut tree - is not struck by lightening!  HELLO!!  I'm not literature major here, but isn't that a prime example of what is called, 'foreshadowing'??  An indication of things to come?\nThey messed up one of the most romantic and climactic scenes in the entire book.\nSo, it's too short, hardly any dialogue is used, they change things that should not be changed, and add so many things that should not be added!\nThey have changed the characters' personalities and it has been for the worse.  They took EXTREME artistic license in making this movie, and I DO NOT like it one bit!!\nIt's not even a good movie in itself.  Even if you have never read the book or even heard of it...the way they rush through it all would leave a viewer completely confused.  I was constantly having to explain to my husband what was happening and why.\nAnyhow, I am not recommending it!", "label": 0}

{"text": "When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's \"Jane Eyre\" movie, they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.\n\nThe 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.\n\nThe 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.\n\nDalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a \"poetic imagination.\" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane.  You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.\n\nOther things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate \"Introduction and Allegro\" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.\n\nIt's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. \"Jane Eyre\" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of \"Jane Eyre\" is not \"bad,\" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.\n\nIf you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.\n\nThere is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found.  Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast.", "label": 0}

{"text": "In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.\n\nI have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.\n\nMilla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.\n\nThis can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.\n\nI first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.", "label": 2}

Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.\n\nTypical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.\n\nAs I watched these movies, I had several \"ah hah\" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.\n\nPerfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.\n\nI highly recommend these latest volumes in the Drive Thru History saga and have added it to my listing of mom-approved movies for families on my wordpress blog.\n\nReviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of \"77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference: Ideas and Activities for Serving Others.\"", "label": 1}

{"text": "\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" (Rankin/Bass Productions, 1970) is a true Christmas classic.  A quintessential \"animagic\" or \"clay-mation\" production, it features the talents of Fred Astaire  (who narrates the story as postman Special Delivery Kluger), Mickey Rooney  (Kris Kringle), Keenan Wynn (Winter Warlock), and Paul Frees (Burgermeister  Meisterburger).  Frees is absolutely brilliant as the voice of the  Burgermeister of the village of Sombertown, which presumably is in  Scandinavia.  In brief, the film explains the origins of various aspects of  the legend of Santa Claus through an original story.  People of all ages  will enjoy \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.\"  Children will love  the animation and the story.  The rest of us appreciate that as well as the  hilarious moments when Kris Kringle expresses surprise (watch his eyes  swell to giant coal-black circles!).  For anyone who grew up in the 1970s  or 1980s, this is a gem of the pop culture of our time.  It's highly  recommended for anyone who has enjoyed other Rankin/Bass classics such as  \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and \"The Little Drummer  Boy.\"", "label": 1}

{"text": "I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before.  One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.", "label": 1}

She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.

{"text": "I like Milla Jovovich as a superhero.  Her breakout role in \"The Fifth Element\" was all that was needed to sell me on her.  She was fine in the first \"Resident Evil\", which was better than perhaps it was given credit for.  But in \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\", Jovovich's Alice is given something of a makeover.  When we last saw Alice at the end of the first movie she had been captured by scientists from the evil Umbrella Corporation and was subject to some tests and experiments.  At the end of the movie we saw Alice walking alone on a street that was desolate and ruined, as if there were some sort of war or battle.  It is at this point that \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" begins.\n\nRaccoon City is the victim of the T-Virus from the Umbrella Corporation.  This virus turns ordinary people into flesh eating zombies (is there another kind?), and like any good zombie virus, it is highly contagious.  Umbrella Corporation apparently has the power to lock down the city and prevent anyone from leaving, but there are still some citizens left alive, including \"disgraced\" police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).  Jill, and another officer attempt to hide before leaving the city and while being confronted by some nasty zombie creatures they meet Alice.  During that whole period where she was a captive and the victim of experiments, Alice has apparently picked up some sort of upgrade to her natural biology because she kicks serious butt here.  She fights like a super soldier or super hero, more like \"The Fifth Element's\" Leeloo than anyone else.\n\nBesides the hordes of zombies, there is also a new super zombie looking creature called Nemesis which is stalking the city.  Exactly what Nemesis is and where it came from is a little bit of a mystery, though a little thinking about the clues given will solve the riddle fairly quickly.\n\nThis is a nothing special action/zombie movie.  Fans of the first \"Resident Evil\" may be disappointed.  I know that despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.  There was more character interaction and character development, but this movie just had hordes of zombies and a bit too much action.  And while I like Jovivich as a superhero, this didn't seem to be a role that really needed to such an incredibly strong superhero.  I guess I didn't belive it.  The door was left open for a third movie, and perhaps there will be one, but until that point there is no real reason to watch \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\".  There are far better movies out there.\n\nGrade: C\n\n-Joe Sherry", "label": 2}

This movie's is basically a bunch of speical effects strung together by a shallow story line that really does not end with any real resolution other than to look out for part 2.\n\nOn top of that you may notice that this movie \"samples\"  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.  Speaking of computers, where else have you seen a computer go on a killing spree? Here's a hint 2001. Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.\n\nIf you want a real thrill get your self the game and start playing.  You will get 10 times the substance and all of your money's worth.\n\nQuite frankly I do not see what is so not helpful about this.  Obviously those who did not find this helpful have no idea about the game in which this movie is supposed to be based on.

{"text": "I just concluded my church small group using this video/book and both my class members and myself thought this was very well done.  I advised my group of the quirkiness based on other Amazon reviews, but that didn't dampen my group's response to the videos.  Each of us thought they were well done and very infomrative.  We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.\n\nThe viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.\n\nI recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.  Once my class ended, people were left wanting more.  Since there are many more parables to consider, perhaps a volume two will be forthcoming.", "label": 1}

Sure I didn't mind many of the inconsistencies to the game to the movie, but get someone who understands how a Beretta operates, the slide locks in place when you're out of ammo.  My biggest issue was the ending, everything made sense how you wouldn't want the story getting out but I think that Paul W.S. Anderson forgot about events in the cold war that led to the establishment of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) there purpose to track missiles...  Translation you can't nuke the city and get away with it, NORAD has our backs.  Then the refusal to use any other mutant other then Lickers is insulting to the far superior Hunter's of almost every Resident Evil game, 6 foot tall killer decapitating frogs just never gets old.

These characters all have several things in common. 1) They are all very Cool, 2) All were supporting characters (as opposed to the stars) of their particular story, 3) All were the only Cool characters in their story.\nNumber three is the thing that really made them work. It is a proven fact that people like \"the cool character\" and so many times a writer of a book or a movie or a television show or even professional wrestling tries to make all the characters \"cool.\" But when every character is a cold, stoic, cigarette smoking SOB with a killer instinct, the effect is diminished. This is the major problem with the movie Gattaca.\nOne could theorize that Writer/Director Andrew Niccol was trying to make a statement about the loss of humanity that occurs in a world built on gene-gineered perfection. But if this is the case, then the metaphor never really materializes. Instead we have a film where all the characters are so cool... so intense... that it is hard to actually identify with any of them. Again, it could be argued that this is intentional, but somehow, I feel as though my inability to truly identify with Ethan Hawke's Vincent character removes something from my enjoyment of the film.\nThat said, I must admit that I did enjoy Gattaca. For starters, the film is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept behind the film is very ambitious and Niccol exploration of the idea is very concise and complete. The ideas generated by the questions this movie asks can provide the viewer with philosophical musings for the rest of the evening.\nThe lead actors, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (not to mention supporting actors Jude Law and Loren Dean) provide no shortage of eye-candy for male of female viewers. One cannot find a fault in Hawke's acting in this film (or Thurman's to be fair) so much as with the characters they were portraying.\nThe tragedy of this film is that there could have been a beautiful love story here. But the characters are so cold that it is hard to see why Irene (Thurman) and Vincent (Hawke) would fall for each other at all. The only truly attractive quality either displays is unbelievable drive.\nDespite its faults, this film is still somewhat recommended. The cinematography is excellent and the ideas presented are so insightful that I can look past the faults of the movie enough to give it 3 stars.", "label": 2}

Though there is a serial killer on the loose, all he cares about is scoring some more weed...which, to most stoners, is pretty right on the target.

No, this is the Caribbean, not Omaha.\nI lost track of the body count because the person I watched this one with couldn't keep a straight face. When I said I was doing my job, they really fell apart.\nThis is that new breed of movie in which no one knows how to write the music. Here, there is scary music every time someone turns their back to the camera. HD20 had the same problem. These little movies used to have some interesting music, as well as some swell camera angles.

{"text": "I'm not a big fan of zombie films to be honest.  I've never really seen the attraction of seeing crowds of zombies being killed in manical and violent ways.\n\"Resident Evil\" is no exception to this rule, but somehow it manages to be entertaining enough to warrant your attention.  The story is based on the top selling computer game although luckily, it doesn't suffer the same fate as films such as \"Tomb Raider\" or \"Super Mario Bros.\" by being total rubbish.  the script has been made to take a back seat to eye-catching set pieces and set designs.  This sort of film doesn't require you to take too much notice, and the producers have realised this by giving you just enough of a storyline to keep track of whats going on amongst all the neck-breaking and dog-kicking.  Mila Jovovich proves that her acting abilities ain't exactly Oscar-winning, whilst Michelle Rodrigues just walks around looking angry and grunting a lot.  But this doesn't really matter.  If the characters were anything more than two dimensional, you'd get it confused with Robert Redford film and walk out.  You don't have time to \"bond\" with the characters; theres big zombie dogs to kill before they escape and eat all the Winalot.\nIt's best to view this film with no big aspirations.  It's almost a re-work of \"Evil Dead\", except Bruce Campbell is now a woman in a red dress.\nAs i mentioned, this film's stand-out feature are the sets and the fight scenes.  The underground \"Hive\" looks superb, and the laser weapon used during the first 45 minutes will have you saying \"Wasn't that also used in 'The Cube' with Nicole DeBoer?\"\nSee this film if you're feeling annoyed on a Saturday afternoon.

{"text": "This movie looks pretty interesting compared to the other Resident Evil. The only problem with the last movie, is that it couldn't reach its full potential since the budget was cut short. I will admit something, Paul Anderson is good at budgeting, but he is not that great at what he does. The problem with this upcoming movie, is that it is not following what the video game had. This movie needs to have a better story line that goes a long with the movie. One of the things that bugs me, is that Jill doesn't work along side of Alice. What I believe he should've done is made a diffrent story line, and put nemesis in it, but not jill, carlos, and nicolai. I believe if he would've stuck with a diffrent story line with diffrent people, and left nemesis in there, this would be a GREAT Movie! But see, the problem with the upcoming movie, is that first off, Nicolai is not the squad leader like he was in RE3. Why not? Why is Carlos the leader now? Also, the licker NEVER showed up in RE3, its debut was in RE2 and then they no longer were brought in. So why is the licker a main choice for this? Possibly if the budget is dephiseted? Well anyway, I will go see this movie, but I do not believe it to follow the video games like it should. But maybe Paul will make a movie revolving around Claire Redfield... That would truly be a masterpiece... But for now, we shall see what this movie shows.", "label": 2}

But it fails utterly.\n\nThis film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.

In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love.  I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear.

There are a few good ones. But, this is not one of them. This is simply a bad comedy, and there are no real jokes here -- just kind of \"stupid comedy\": the characters constantly simply act stupidly, and that is supposed to be funny. There is nothing clever here. There is no believable character, with the exception of Roddy MacDowell. He is the one saving grace, and his professional acting ability shines way above the rest. He is playing a comically \"reluctant\" vampire killer, who doesn't really believe in vampires but plays a vampire killer in his films and on TV. Now he has to actually kill a vampire, after he finally comes to believe they are real. Thankfully, Roddy MacDowall is in this film. But the plot, the other actors, the \"jokes\" are really bad. The special effects are mostly consisting of \"melting faces\", and were done on the cheap. Good special effects for the time and for a low budget -- but, not very good for scaring the audience. At the time this was made (1985) perhaps it deserved good reviews as a send-up of horror films. But, it really does not stand the test of time, in my opinion.\n\nThere is a remake (2011) that actually is fairly good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fright-Night/dp/B003Y5H5FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fright Night</a>.

{"text": "Let's see, where to start.  Melanie Griffith is supposed to be one of the best, toughest, smartest defense attorneys in the city, but acts more like a former stripper playing at being a recent law school grad. I guess  seductive whispers, a slinky walk, and tepid one-line comebacks are all it  takes to free rapist/killers.  Realism is non-existent as she voluntarily  gives away key information/evidence to the DA and her powerful adversaries  before the trial even starts.  Her crack investigative team manages to  stumble across valuable clues at the drop of a hat without even a trace of  intelligent, logical, deductive reasoning or sleuthing.  The dialog is  absolutely inane, including an awful scene where this supposedly  hard-boiled attorney (Griffith) who has successfully defended the scum of  the earth, suddenly realizes a full five minutes into the interrogation of  her client (a major slimeball) that she believes his story--that he was  just having kinky sex, slapping his date around, and didn't really kill the  girl--and starts crying at this realization.  Supposed to be touching I'm  sure, but instead it was so out of place and baffling, I cringed while  laughing. In addition there's this weird, pointless side story about a  former client whom she got acquitted, then slept with, only to find out he  was actually guilty of rape all along.  Throughout the movie he repeatedly  calls her and taunts her through her answering machine causing her to  listen for several minutes before unplugging it, or turning it off, or  throwing it against the wall, but never doing anything that makes sense,  like changing her phone number.  Even this elicits no real emotion from  her, she basically sleepwalks through the movie.  But, worst of all, this  movie is boring--no suspense, no thrills, and I didn't care one bit about  the fortunes of any of the characters.  I have really liked Griffith in  several recent movies and do not understand this one at all, except that  she's just horribly miscast--as is everyone in this film.  In fact, why I  even devoted this much time in reviewing this escapes me--except maybe I'll  save someone a few bucks and a couple of wasted hours.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The movie Joseph from The Bible Collection is an extremely worthwhile movie to watch. As a Bible-believing Christian and follower of Christ, the main criteria for me is always the question--Is it true to the biblical text? This movie, combined with the King James language is extremely close to the biblical text and I can almost follow along in scripture with many scenes. It is very enjoyable and portrays the biblical account in a fresh, relevant way.\n\nI highly recommend Joseph to any family and encourage any parent to watch it with their children, teenagers and even young adults that may be out of the home and on their own. Recently, I watched David from this Collection with my 23-year-old son when he came to visit and am awaiting his return to watch Joseph.\n\nThe movie is poignant and lively as it retells the story of the brothers' betrayl and sin against Joseph as they sell him into slavery. During these scenes, my heart was gripped, feeling many emotions as the story unfolded.\n\nI believe this movie does an excellent job portraying the story of faith as Joseph rises to prominence within Pharoah's court, suffers in prison because of false accusations, and especially as he forgives his brothers. Joseph's revelation of his identity to his brothers and his reunion with his family is outstanding and emotionally moving.\n\nThe acting of Ben Kingsley as Pharoah and the rest of the cast is superb and it is best to watch it when you have 3 hours to set aside or take an intermission in the middle of it. This movie will enhance your biblical knowledge of Joseph while adding a visual dimension to your Bible knowledge.\n\nThe movie also provides a wonderful introduction with moral lessons to any child, teenager or young adult. Another movie that I highly recommended from The Bible Collection is David starring Nathaniel Parker and Leonard Nimoy. It is one of my favorites and like Joseph, is very close to the original King James text. Thanks for listening.", "label": 1}

{"text": "It is impossible to overestimate the important of this 1979 film, for it has made an impact in even the most primitive regions of the earth, places where men and women are only now hearing about Jesus for the first time.  This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.\nThe movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.\nThe suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.", "label": 1}

The original game (currently being remade for Nintendo GameCube) had the perfect premise for a scary movie, it had the atmosphere, the monsters, the suprises and everything that kept a person on thier toes, all things which the movie that was made a s a prequel did not have. WHat did this movie have that was good? Michelle Rodrigiez is very good looking... aside from that... There were some great makeup effects, but the one non-zombie monster that appeared was the licker, which looked terribly CGI. Over all the special effects were unimpressive, they held back way to much with the gore, and there was far more eye roller moments than scares. This is what we call a hack fest flick, except there wasn't a lot of hacking... so there wasn't a lot going on here that would make it a good horror flick.

The same can be said of all of the other game based movies.

{"text": "In the opening scene a thirteen-year-old Joan of Arc witnesses English soldiers burning her village and raping and murdering her sister.  This much is true: the real Joan of Arc's village was pillaged when she was thirteen.  She never had a sister.  The villagers took refuge in a nearby castle.  Those invaders weren't English and were probably about thirty years younger than the actors chosen for the scene.\n\nNearly all of the principal roles in this film are miscast.  The historical Joan of Arc was seventeen years old and not very pretty.  King Charles VII was twenty-six.  Most of the leading soldiers were around the same age.  Decades of war and disease had decimated the older generation.\n\nThis film consistently begs the question of how its unstable heroine ever rose to power, depicts her as the bewildered observer of her own success, and portrays king Charles VII as the thoroughly unworthy object of her devotion.  Don't look here for subtle characterizations.  Factions line up from the moment they meet Joan of Arc and wait for the chance to act (which, given the story's repeated assertions about her insignificance, is pretty odd).\n\nHistorically accurate details make their appearance in awkward and disruptive ways.  Older biopics about Joan of Arc generally had sanitized violence and bloodless battles.  This film is gruesome in all the wrong ways.  It is also true that some fifteenth-century hedonists liked to eat dinner in a bathtub built for two.  No record suggests Charles VII ever did this - he was actually known for his piety - and the film's decision to plop him into one seems based on the assumption that John Malkovich needs props to be sufficiently creepy.\n\nThe Messenger isn't exactly an anti-historical film.  Many of its story and character elements have respectable pedigrees.  Some twentieth-century scholars treat Joan of Arc as more of a psychological case study than a political or military leader.  I doubt it was the filmmakers' intention to discredit these theories by dramatizing how unsatisfactory they are as narrative, but in this respect at least The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc succeeds.", "label": 0}

Some, like Nightmare on Elm Street, are every bit as gripping and fascinating as I remember them. Some, however, have suffered in the interim.\nFright Night is still a fun movie, overall, but it has not dated very well. The music, the look of it, is all very very 80's. The effects are good, but nothing spectacularly better then other films of the time. And none of the actors are putting their best foot forward. Roddy McDowell and another actor share a scene near the end that does manage to capture some real pathos, but other then that it's all too campy, with writing and plot that doesn't support that choice. Camp acting in a dark and serious plot is just not a good mix.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I'm curious about why so many reviewers made a point of saying this movie was nothing like The Ring other than the fact that both are Americanized remakes of the Japanese originals. The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.\n\nAt the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.\n\nThe demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.\n\nI actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).\n\nThe non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.\n\nOne more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.\n\nThe movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.\n\nFirst, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling \"why should I care?\" Because Sam Raimi (\"Evil Dead\" and \"Spiderman\") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.\n\nSecond, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving. If you're expecting Buffy kicking demon ass, you'll need to look at reruns or DVD compilations. Buffy is no where to be found in this movie.\n\nBottom line: I recommend this movie IF you are open to the fact that it is a Japanese ghost story and with the exception of casting American actors, does little to Westernize the film. If you're expecting The Ring (the Westernized version) you'll be disapointed.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in American history.  Nevertheless, a few of the liberties taken with the characters and historical inaccuracies are too much to warrant a  5-star rating.\nHere are just three examples:\n1. Washington's Language -  Although Jeff Daniels's portrayal of Washington as a hot-tempered,  foul-mouthed, flawed hero appeals to our modern cynicism and desire to  debunk the myths behind our heroes, there are some serious questions as to  the film's accuracy on this front.  George Washington did have a volcanic  temper, but he had learned to control it - and that was part of the  strength of his character.  The movie depicts him as being almost  constantly frustrated and bordering on an outburst.  This does not reflect  the truth as can be evidenced by the reaction many of Washington's  subordinates had on those RARE occasions when Washington did lose his cool.  Were he as temperamental as Daniels portrays him, the outbursts Washington  DID have wouldn't have been as significant to those around him as they  were.  In addition, the language attributed to Washington in this film is  in direct contrast with Washington's own orders against cursing.  I don't  question the fact that a few words may have slipped now and then, but it's  very inconsistent with the historical record to portray Washington as  foul-mouthed as this film does.\n2. Alexander Hamilton was not  Washington's aide at the Battle of Trenton.  He was an artillery captain.  He did not come into Washington's service until later.\n3. The exchange  between Horatio Gates and Washington was clearly overblown for dramatic  effect.  It's no secret that the two didn't like each other, but there's no  evidence to support the film's contention that Washington threatened to  have Gates shot.\nI don't want my criticisms to make it seem like the  movie had no merit.  Howard Fast and the film's production team do an  outstanding job in showing just how desperate the American situation was  prior to Trenton.  For this alone, the movie is well worth watching.", "label": 2}

{"text": "After seeing the horrible \"reworking\" done on Nakata Hideo's scare-fest \"RING\" by director Gore Verbinski and DreamWorks-- and seeing how director Walter Salles intends to 'one-up' Verbinski with his complete mangling of another Nakata masterpiece, \"HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA\" (currently in production as \"DARK WATER\" with Disney/Touchstone as joint culprit) --I had some hesitation about wanting to see the Hollywood remake of \"JUON.\" But four specific things fueled my interest in this Occidental revision entitled \"The Grudge\":\n\n(1) It would keep the story set in Japan, using many of the same sets and actors of the original series;\n\n(2) Sam Raimi (\"The Evil Dead\") not only put up the money to have this movie remade, but he was so appreciative of the original Japanese theatrical production (and so confident of the success of the remake) that he was instrumental in getting \"JUON\" a wide US distribution even before the remake was completed and released to theatres;\n\n(3) Raimi insisted that Shimizu Takashi, the director of the original productions, be retained as the director of the US remake as well;\n\n(4) The pre-release trailers of the film made it unambiguously obvious that, unlike the distorted crud given to us by the teams of DreamWorks/Verbinski & Disney/Salles, \"The Grudge\" was going to be a true \"remake\" that remained VERY faithful to the original material.\n\nOf course, none of that could guarantee that I'd be 100% satisfied with the result because, sadly, I wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was a bad movie or a failed experiment -- there is still much to like about this movie even for hardened \"Juon Junkies\" like myself. It's just that this film, as faithful a remake as it was, just didn't have the right kind of \"texture\": Gone was the gloominess & ambiance of the original productions, gone was the slow-paced and the tension build-up, gone was the \"REAL\" reason Saeki Takeo murdered his family (but, of course, reusing the original Japanese cast as the Saeki family, that really could not have been helped short of casting Jason Scott Lee or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in the \"Kobayashi-sensei/Peter\" role), and gone was the \"REAL\" reason Kayako makes that unsettling croaking noise (and it's not the reason they try to make you believe it is in the remake). There was never a moment in the film where I was not aware that I was watching a \"Hollywood\" production -- all of the \"Asian qualities\" I liked so much about the original series just weren't in this movie, and it's not because of the presence of Caucasian actors and English dialogue. My difficulty in relating to this remake stems from the fact that the presentation was too bright, too loud, too fast, too sanitized, too refined, too perfect -- lacking all the \"rawness\" and the pure emotion of the original series.\n\nFor those not all that familiar with what I'm talking about, \"The Grudge\" is based on a series of movies called \"JUON\" or \"JU-ON\" (literal translation: \"curse grudge\"). It began as a two-part 'V-Cinema' (Japan's version of 'made-for-television/video') series called, appropriately, \"JUON\" and \"JUON 2\" -- which were marketed (but not \"officially\" titled) with the English companion title, \"THE CURSE.\" Because of the immediate success of these two V-Cinema productions, writer/director Shimizu Takashi was given a bigger budget to work with along with a green light to begin work on a theatrical version, that was released under the name, \"JUON\" -- which, after a successful run in theatres throughout Asia, was followed by a theatrical sequel called, you guessed it, \"JUON 2.\" In order to alleviate some of the confusion that was certain to arise, \"JUON\" and \"JUON 2,\" the theatrical versions, were distinguished from their V-Cinema counterparts by being given the marketed (yet still \"unofficial\") English title, \"THE GRUDGE.\"\n\nContrary to popular misinformation spreading about, \"Juon\" (theatrical) is not a remake of \"Juon\" (v-cinema), but is, along with the theatrical sequel, a \"continuation\" of the same story; much like \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" is a 'continuation' of the original Star Trek television series' \"Space Seed\" episode. So, in actuality, the theatrical release of \"Juon\" and its sequel are best described as \"Juon, part 3\" and \"Juon, part 4\" respectively.\n\nBecause most of the people who learn of the original story generally become familiarized only with the first theatrical production (\"Part 3\"), they naturally assume that \"The Grudge\" is a remake of that film, when in reality the Western remake incorporates important story elements from both the first 'theatrical' production (\"Part 3\") and the first 'video' production (\"Part 1\"), thereby providing much of the \"back story\" one would normally not have if they were only familiar with the theatrical releases of the original story. So, in this sense, \"The Grudge\" provides some important (but really not all that necessary) background details for those who have seen \"Juon\" (the movie) but were unable to gain access to the original V-Cinema productions.\n\nAnyway, as the opening screen text explains (in all five films), \"Juon\" refers to [paraphrasing] a curse that is born when someone dies violently in the grip of a powerful rage where there is great resentment, etc., etc. Because of having died such an undignified death, the resentment (or 'grudge') lingers & festers in the place(s) where the horrific murders occurred, which then indiscriminately lashes out at ANYONE (male, female, adult, child, rich, poor, married, single, Asian, Caucasian, Terran, Martian, whatever) who trespasses upon the cursed site -- in this case, the central location where the curse resides & emanates from is a typical Japanese \"middle-class\" house (in the V-Cinema, it is the same house plus another apartment in a different part of town). The curse does not always manifest itself right away; in fact, it might take years before the cursed spirits enact their rage against their victims -- and the victims are not always dispatched the same way: some get strangled, some get literally ripped to pieces, others just \"disappear,\" and so on. The spectres are also not bound by the time/space continuum as we know it, often creating temporal shifts and so-forth. Also, in the \"Juon\" series, each attack has the potential for creating a new \"juon\" (i.e., the victim could then be 'reborn,' as it were, as another vengeful spirit), but \"The Grudge\" plays down this aspect of the curse and pretty much just sticks with building up the body count. And unlike \"RING,\" there is no way to break the curse or to keep it from spreading other than to just stay out of that damned house.\n\nAnd though Mr. Raimi chose to keep the story set in its native Japan and limited the use of Caucasian actors, I am convinced that the film could have just as easily been set in NYC, L.A., or here in Honolulu, where heavy Asian populations reside and speak English as their native language, assuming that it was his intent was to cater to Japanese or other Asian cultural themes. Such a move could have been just as effective and would have given him better rationale for using Caucasian-American actors. But because of using a new cast of white American characters in Japan while having key members of the Japanese cast reprise their original roles, the story as it plays out in the remake loses some of its effectiveness and justifications, due to the inability to duplicate certain situations which account for some of the specific behaviors associated with certain characters, thus resulting in slightly different interpretations of the two films.\n\nAs far as recommending this movie on its own merits, I'd have no problem encouraging the 'uninitiated' to give it a fair look.\n\nTo those who are familiar with any of the \"Juon\" presentations (esp. those privileged enough to have viewed all four original entries), my recommendation comes a bit harder. Again, as I've already expressed, my specific prejudices have already influenced my decision to not include this remake in my personal collection, but if you're stoked to see a remake that is \"truly\" a remake, which remains very faithful to the original and refuses to take \"dumbed-down\" Hollywood-style 'liberties' with the source material, then you just might appreciate this movie on that level. On the other hand, if you, like myself, appreciated the ethereal qualities and slow-pace of the originals, I'm not so enthusiastic about recommending it outright, and I would suggest renting it out first before jumping in head-first.\n\nIn any event, it's really not a terrible movie; and for newbies, it could open a whole new window into Asian cinema. ~ Aloha!", "label": 2}

{"text": "Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.\nMuch of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.\nMartin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.\nAustralian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (\"Strictly Ballroom\") is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).\nIncluded in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.\nFilmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who \"does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death\" is worth watching again and again.", "label": 1}

But no, they had to make everybody so sweet, so wonderful that I had to go eat an anchovy.\n So start with the father:\n\n An aging affluent lawer brings home to live with him and his two young children a girl almost half his age. She is neither a wife nor is there any talk about marriage at that time. The children are confused about her role in their father's life. The little boy asks his father why his dad and mom got divorced. Dad's answer is remarkable: \"because daddy doesn't love mommy any longer\". Then he changes it to a \"better\" answer: \"daddy loves mommy, but not that way\". How caring!\n\n Dad is really great. He loves his girlfriend \"that way\". Passions are so great that the two lovers forget to close the door while they love each other \"that way\".

To take the children from their irresponsible father would be too damaging. Really....\n\n There is no sex in this movie because of its rating, but the ideas are much more damaging for the young mind.\n\n At this point the makers of the movie decided that it was not fair to blame everything on poor Ed Harris.

Interesting, what did he do in order to be thrown out of the house by the woman who had quit her career years ago in order to dedicate herself to her children and this man?\n\n Anyway... When the children's misery and hatred to their so called stepmom reaches its maximum the wise dad decides that it would be an appropriate moment to propose to Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts, God bless her, can't wait to marry this older man with a bunch of hating children and alimony payments. It's ok that the dad is almost never there and the poor girlfriend has to take care of the brats almost full time (Can't they hire a babysitter?). Note that she is not a gold digger, she herself is a high-paid rising-star photographer. There is nothing in the movie that explains this girl's attraction to this man. Ed Harris, who has an ability as an actor to develop a complex, emotionally intense, charismatic character ( See \"The Third Miracle\" - a much better movie), did nothing for this role.\n\n Now, there is the mother. She is dying of cancer, but being a proud person she doesn't want her ex and children to know about it. Or may be this is the fear that as soon as the pack of wolves smells her weakness she will be stomped all over. And sure enough,  as soon as they accidentally find out about her illness, the children start treating their mother as if she is already dead. This is turning point for them to start looking to accepting Julia Roberts as their next mother. And at this point they find out that she is actually fun. She doesn't listen to \"boring\" classic music as their mother (a big plus), she is a little bit trashy (definitely a big plus), she is young and healthy (unlike their old and sick scary mother). Most importantly, they don't have to rise to the higher moral standard this family once had.\n\n  Ed Harris, give him credit, a \"wonderful\" man, promises the mother that \"she won't go through this (chemotherapy, radiation, death) alone\". From this moment, as was said in another review, Ed Harris mysteriously disappears. Except for one \"act of kindness\" when he bought a Christmas tree for his children that is. Susan Sarandon is devastated by the loss of first her husband, then her children and now she has only a few weeks to live. Apparently she doesn't have any other friends or family except somewhere in CA where she goes to smoke medicinal dope (is this a plug?).\nBefore that she is mostly by herself in a huge house. The children are with the girlfriend. The ex is busy making money. Her suffering is intolerable.\n\n  Remarkably, none of these \"wonderful\" people feels generous enough to come to her and give this pretty much discarded woman a big hug and say the words that have to be said. There is nothing to fight about anymore: the mother lost and the girlfriend achieved the status of top female in the pack. Ed Harris is missing until the movie's budget ran out and they had to make a final Christmas scene. He suddenly appears in the end and acts so we all hope that his mid-life crisis is over. Julia turns from an annoying moron into a relatively mature individual, the mother forgives everybody, and the children are happy, because though their mother is dying , there will finally be clarity about who is who, and no need to go from one house to another every couple of days. As I said, there is nothing to fight about. The mother will be dead in a few weeks. She lost and she knows this, so she tries to make her children remember her as a nice person.\n\n Julia won (how could she not?). By the way, the children hug their mother finally in the last scene.\n\nEd Harris is concerned who is going to take care of children when Julia is at work. Luckily Julia is happy to quit her high-paying glamorous job to raise Ed's children.\n\n  I wonder if she can have her job back when Ed decides he doesn't love her \"that way\" any longer?\n Susan Sarandon and the boy show good acting, but material is so bad that this movie is a joke.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I've never claimed to be an expert on movie-making. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse.\" Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to \"Resident Evil.\" Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.\n\nTo begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more \"hip.\" Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one \"shoot 'em up\" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called \"scary\" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the \"Nemesis\" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.\n\nFor me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.\n\nBottom line: \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The \"Resident Evil\" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting \"Citizen Kane.\" But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre.

{"text": "This movie was recommended to me and I had heard that it was classic and like De Niro as an actor along with Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel.  If you were to edit the useless scenes out of this movie it'd be about 30 min.  Foster is billed as a main character but has one scene in the first hour.  Shepherd's character serves no purpose outside of showing that De Niro's character has issues, which you should be able to figure out fairly easy without her character.\n\nHaving not been alive when this movie came I'm not going to try to understand the time because I simply can't but this movie is so utterly boring that it almost puts you to sleep.  Then just when you think it's going to get good with a shootout De Niro gets shot in the neck and shoulder and just keeps on going.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.  It's boring and bad.

I am not a fan of, or seen many of the original \"Avengers\", so I had no preconceived ideas that way about how the story should go. And had really wanted to \"enjoy\" a big budget, bad movie. It doesn't start out to bad, but I found the lack of chemistry between all the actors to be unbearable. It's like they are all acting in separate movies, or have some sort of off screen feud going on, and refuse to talk to each other. But in the appalling delivery of lines, apparently written by someone with a severe lack of imagination and no sence of humor.\n\n Also, if you had seen only this movie with Sean Connery, you would wonder just why he was an actor. The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.\n\n And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the \"supporting\" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.\n\n So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad. And you have to enjoy the only opportunity to see a deeply respected actor(Connery), make a fool of himself in a gigiant bear suit. Other than that, if you really must find out how bad this is...rent it!", "label": 0}
{"text": "The Grudge would've been a perfect haunted house horror movie if the story was as good as the visuals in it. It doesn't make much sense why the ghosts in the house whom had been victims of a madman would go after people who had nothing to do with their deaths. The curse aspect of the story is not well explained. There were at least ten shocking and scary moments in this movie. The attack in the bedroom was one very memorable scene, as well as the scene when Sarah Michelle Gellar got touched by the hand of the ghost while she was shampooing her hair. I think the special effects and scary scenes are much more powerful than the Original Japanese Version of this film. The Madman's role in this film is zoomed down to almost non-existent, and Gellar's role is enlarged to ensure that she can carry the film to the end. So it's slightly different compared to the Original Version.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Having been somewhat fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc, and entertained by the French flair of Director Luc Besson's movies, it pains me to say that my disappointment in THE MESSENGER is most profound.  Truly, with such a promising opening scene and more than a couple of excellent actors at its disposal - not to mention a mythical and supernatural aura intertwined with an amazing history - one would expect, even at the very least, a little glimmer of brilliance.\nYet, apparently, it never was meant to be.  However, I must say, the movie opens promisingly enough:  There's the pious child, Joan d'Arc, living her bright yet humble life in the 15th century French countryside. - She is portrayed at once as being extraordinarily blessed and preternaturally enlightened, by Heaven.  There's Music of Angels singing ecstatic praise, Visions of Divine Power moving nature around her, and Voices of \"Him.\" (Be it Deity, Angel, Archangel, or perhaps her own Subconscious Soul?  I cannot tell...) - All so enticing and gravitating her toward Heavenly bliss.\nYet it is within minutes of these glorious opening scenes that everything takes a very dark turn.  Suddenly, the child Joan sees the storm clouds culminate as the wolves and the English Army thunder in.  The sight of this is quite ominous -- not only for the child Joan, but for the entire course of the movie as well.  It's a shame - because, from here, THE MESSENGER actually could very well have become a movie of remarkable depth, voice and vision.\nInstead, the whole thing engulfs itself in blustering failures - its own annihilation ignited with the first sight of Milla Jovovich as Joan, the peasant girl, suddenly all grown up.  She makes her first appearance having somehow made her way to the castle of Chinon with a message to the Dauphin Charles VII, France's heir to the crown.  The movie offers no explanation as to how this unknown teenage girl had come to be known as the \"Maid of Lorraine,\" nor of how she had made her way into the French Court.\nApart from various transitional errors and a stunning lack of continuity, this picture further bears the awesome burden of poor casting and an even poorer script.  John Malkovich (Dauphin Charles VII) did a fine enough job of it - however, the script, relative to the role, was not compatible with his talents - and he was very blatantly miscast.  As for Milla Jovovich:  Well, I cannot say much about that folly, actually, without blasting away all credibility to her as an actress.  Truly, that's something I really do not wish to do.  Really, I must say in her defense that it seems she was obliged to make do with a script that made her sound like a borderline psychotic and rebellious adolescent somewhat of the present-day variety.  It's impossible to buy the possibility that anyone in the French Army would even consider following her lead.\nSadly enough, the only reason I halfway speak in her defense is that she seemed to speak her lines as if she hated every single word of them - and her every look seemed to disdain the movie.  OK - Well, regardless, even for that, I guess I cannot in my heart of hearts give her any credit as an actress.\nFinally, I must give no insignificant amount of credit to Dustin Hoffman (the Voice), Faye Dunaway (Mother-In-Law to the Dauphin, Princess d'Aragon), and Timothy West (Pierre Cauchon - a prominent figure in Joan's final trial) for making the most of a flippant and shallow script.\nFinally, all the more I can say about this movie is that it could have been great, with only a bit more insight.  It's a shame that it fell the other way....", "label": 0}

A group of scientists, working in a secret installation known only as \"The Hive\", play God, experimenting on DNA and creating a mutating virus.  When an attempt is made to steal the virus, the thief unleashes the virus.  The Hive's security defenses, in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading, seals off the facility, killing all within.  A special military unit is sent to discover the reason behind the deaths at the facility, and to shut down the \"murderous\" main computer controlling the security defenses within the hive.  What they don't know is that the virus that was unleashed mutates the dead into nightmarish zombies.\nAlthough the action is slow in coming, when it hits you're in for a rollercoster ride!  The movie is very true to the game.  The  zombies move exactly like those in the game, even when they are being shot.  Milla Jovovich is every bit the action heroine.  At the beginning of the movie she appears to be a helpless damsel in distress, but we soon learn that she's anything but.  And there are even some genuine surprises in the end.\nMy only gripe with the movie is that it reminds me all too much of Aliens.  A slow start, followed by extreme action and bloody deaths, a strong female lead.  Even the military unit reminds me of the Marines in Aliens.  The character played by Michelle Rodriguez is reminiscent of Vazquez from Aliens.  And the plot twist is also similar.

{"text": "Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, Spice World is a grossly lacking film, even for those who enjoy the music. Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles \"A Hard Days Night\", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.\n\nPiers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.\n\nSince the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.\n\nWhile each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.\n\nWith brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.\n\n- Mike Massie", "label": 0}

Maybe she was a feminist in an age of male domination who decided to use God as a ladder to French Royalty. All  interesting possiblities. All completely ignored by this film. I doubt that  even Luc Besson could explain what he thought of Joan of Arc and he doesn't  even try to here. Depite battle sequences that are almost on par with those  of Braveheart, a terrifc cast giving superb performances, and stunning  visuals the film falls completely flat . I would've prefered it if the film  had nothing good in it. It would have been easier to dismiss, but the  presence of such great elements makes the whole that much more of a  disappointment. Milla Jovovich gives her all in the lead role, Malkcovich  is as usual terrific as the sly back stabbing king, Faye Dunaway wreaks of  menace despite being underused. Then we come to Dustin Hoffman as The  Conscience, who I think is Besson's attempt at redeaming himself. After  roaming through the first half of the film, giving us battle sequence after  another, dream sequence after another, all which look magnifecent, but by  the third time you see them you start wondering if he is going anywhere  with this, he doesn't. The Conscience is his feeble attempt at  understanding Joan, but it comes too late, and by then we are not so much  interested in understanding her, as much as we are hoping that the film  would end. By the time the film is over you'll be thinking to yourself,  what a waste of lots of great elements in this completely pointless mess.

{"text": "I saw this movie years ago, when it came out and remember loving it. This time it felt so dated and corny and melodramatic, I couldn't believe it! Even young Julia Roberts seemed like a mediocre actress, and Dolly Parton was off-the-charts hokey. Most of the jokes were simply not funny, and at least a third of the film should have been edited out. Instead the scenes went on and on and on....I guess our tastes  and sensibilities change, and apparently, I'd say for the better. It's not that the movie was terrible; it still had some nice features, and a few of the actors were convincing or entertaining. Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis, for example, were hilarious foils for each other. Sally Field was mostly really good, despite a questionable script. Scrap the rest, especially the contrived Louisiana ambience and fake accents. Not authentic, not colorful. Don't bother. I give it three stars for effort, a few touching scenes and a sweet/sad theme about self-sacrifice for someone you love.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The movie is an OK exercise in First Amendment privileges and the power of the press to ruin innocent people's lives, but basically it turns a yawn-making subject into a Florida travelogue that rivals MIAMI VICE and De Palma's SCARFACE for imaginative use of Florida locations.\n\nSally Field and Paul Newman make an uneasy match together.  The truth is that, at 55, he is a wee bit too old for her and might well have played her father.  She isn't looking good either, but I give her credit for taking a part which isn't entirely sympathetic, for she could have traded on her lovability factor (\"You like me!\") for years without wandering into the heavy waters of something like ABSENCE OF MALICE.  Paul Newman has a role made for him, down to the twist \"Sting\" ending which will remind you of a dozen other movies he made over the years (and continues to make, God bless him).  --Such as THE VERDICT or BUTCH CASSIDY.\n\nWith his frosty blue eyes I can see him playing an Irishman, though it's a stretch.  This is right around the period where his screen persona began to go over the top, from leading man to full-on legend, and he hasn't really aged since.  Eighty this year, Newman remains one of our favorite leading men, but ABSENCE OF MALICE doesn't really do anything for him one way or the other.  Melinda Dillon, whose career really should have been a big one, shows a lot of restrained power here, but nothing that suggests that she and Sally Field should have switched roles as was whispered back during the original release of this movie.", "label": 2}

Julia Roberts, naturally, is very good to look at, Susan Sarandon is not bad either; despite this, they play the parts of the wife-to-be and the ex-wife excellently. The modern, hip, touch is that the wife-to-be is living with the ex-husband and husband to be, Ed Harris, in the role of step mom to his children, who, in the course of the things, will become her step-children.  Ed Harris, manages to keep smiling ,playing fifth significant person to the two women and, in point of fact, to his 12 year old daughter and ca, 8 year old son. This is the kind of film in which men are just a backdrop to the two women (as in the days of Davis and Hopkins).\nThe film goes on too long for what it has to say, becoming tedious by the Christmas Day ending.

{"text": "I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated (in the US) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri's  Queen Margot.  Not quite!  There are certainly aspects of brilliance here  both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich's performance, but there is a  tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the  plot.  Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known, but many times, the  director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins.  It's a long  film, but that shouldn't be a vice.  Here it is, because long portions  could be cut without harming the overall effect.  Better yet, the themes  could have been better established and linked and the character development  focused better.  Apart from the title character, everyone else was pretty  much constructed of cardboard.\nWhat really offended me about The Messenger was the  dialogue, which in many places is simply ludicrous.  There is plenty of  90's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche, but very little authentic  sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French  nobility (and royalty) and peasants.  At the same time, there are some  cheap, Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble  like the Three Stooges, while Joan takes some implausible action.  In these  respects, at least, The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest  common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well.  This sort of  triviality really disappoints me, as I think it did a lot to mediocratize  another film which should have been very good, Mel Gibson's Patriot.  All  in all, what is frustrating is that this could also have been a very worthy  effort, perhaps memorable, but fails because the whole was far less than  the sum of the parts.", "label": 0}

And it turned out to be quite good!\nThis was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!)\nLast Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool.\nThe whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: \"I'll be back!\", \"Trust me\" and \"Do it\". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that!\nAlso look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme!\nThere are some great lines in this. Some of these are:\nDanny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you?\nJack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.\nDanny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!\nJack Slater: Gesundheit.\nJack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat?\nDanny Madigan: Patients?\nJack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing?\nDanny Madigan: Wearing thin?\nJack Slater: Bingo!\nBenedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on\n[takes out the ticket]\nBenedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win!\nSo if you're not keen on Austin O'Brien, see how many celebrities you can spot, and how much Arnie acts up in this movie!

I laughed, shouted out advice or predictions, had a few suprises, and am maybe in love with Mila Jovovich. She looks simply fantastic, all wetted down in that little dress with her leather boots and kicking zombie butt.\n2002 had two revivals of creature feature mayhem at it's best; \"Eight Legged Freaks\" with it's Giant Mutant Spiders On The Loose theme and the adorable Scarlet Johanson, and \"Resident Evil\" resurrecting the Zombie Movie for the Internet generation. Every possible Zombie Movie convention or style is shamelessly ripped off or recycled, with doses of \"Aliens\", \"The Andromeda Strain\" and even \"The Matrix\" thrown in for good measure. The film even boasts repeated, close-up views of Digital Readouts [of varying colors] ticking down until the film's implied doomsday. I am a connesiour [sp?] of Digital Readout movies, and \"Resident Evil\" has the best Digital Readouts I have seen since \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". If you want to watch a movie where you are constantly reminded of how long the plot has until doomsday, this is the movie for you.\nIt is also a movie that helpfully reminds its viewers of exactly what is going on every ten minutes or so by having a character list the plot details up to that point. This is done for the benefit of viewers who may have calculated that a run for the restroom is about due during the theatrical runs, and helps jar the memory of those who may not have been paying attention to every minute of the DVD. I found that helpful, because the people I watched it with and I were constantly discussing what was going on to the point where we were talking about the movie more than watching it. \"Resident Evil\" is an interactive film, and requires a sense of humor in addition to a strong stomach.\nI am sorry that I missed seeing this movie in a theater; two of my fondest cinema visits were the aforementioned \"Eight Legged Freaks\", where each and every one of the audience members were interacting with each other and the movie. And \"Starship Troopers\", which I saw in NYC with an audience that, like me, were besides themselves with hilarity during the entire running length. \"Resident Evil\" is very much a film in the same genre, and as such delivered the goods, and is certainly due for some sort of \"cult\" status as time goes on. It is truly Something Awful.\nBut you know what? I'd rather have fun watching a movie than be subjected to an additional three hour purgatory like the two films that will probably contend for Best Movie this year [Peter Jackson's seriously bloated \"The Two Towers\" and Martin Scorcese's overtly ponderous \"Gangs of New York\"].

Again, don't get me wrong, I like the movie for what it is...action, action and more action. There is some great stylish violence in the film, some outstanding visual effects and make-up and decent acting from a reasonable cast. Milla Jovovich is very good in the film (although I must admit, I am kind of partial to her) and Michelle Rodrigues is another standout, However, the supporting cast was a little weak and I think they could have done a better job in that department.\nThe story of the film basically follows the game, but strays a little here and there. One of my favorite parts of the film is the \"red queen\" She is very interesting and well thought out. Overall, the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed watching it, but I just can't bring myself to give it more than three and a half stars due to the plot holes and sub-par supporting cast.\nThe dvd is good. The menus look nice and the picture looks vivid and clear. The audio is also good. My only complaint is the extras, a little sub-par. The commentary track is nice, but there are no deleted scenes, outtakes or alternate scenes or endings. There are some featurettes, but they are a waste of time.\nThe movie gets 3 and a half stars.

The editor is obviously talented.  The production design crew was obviously talented.  The story was salvageable.  Nonetheless, the film just plain stucked!  1) The directing of the actors was completely unconvincing. Every character and every emotional expression seemed like the director had no ability to pull an original, believable performance out of these capable actors.  2) It was totally derivative of films like Aliens and countless video games: \"Keep it tight people\", \"Get over here!\" etc, etc. 3) The gore was pointlessly disgusting to the point of connoisseurship, as if gore fans will be sipping their Pepsi like fine wine and commenting in a faux English accent, \"Ah yes, that's just wonderful how the white of his eye just leaked out of that laser cut. And, oh my, the sound of walking on broken ankles is just an exhilarating aural bouquet.\"  I think people are actually getting off on this stuff, which is just sick.  4) The cinematography, which again must be approved by the director, is totally overdone.  Every single shot is seemingly an extreme close up or swooping crane movement or some other camera technique that is best used in moderation.  It's again just contrived to the point of aggravation.  5) The plot development and character development is totally out of whack, so that we don't know who anyone is or why we should give a damn until halfway into the film, and this is not in a good way like in Memento.  6) A giant beehive-like underground corporate R&D complex, a supercomputer AI programmed as the dead daughter of the programmer, self defense mechanisms that meet the ridiculous criteria parodied in Galaxy Quest...I could go on and on with the laughable ideas portrayed in this film.  Even worse is the ridiculous exposition the characters indulge in to relay these facts to us.  In the end I was left with a serious case of that \"bad film\" feeling.  A waste of my time and obviously the high quality film stock it was painstakingly photographed on.", "label": 0}

If the killer in the first movie was mad about what they did \"last summer\", then by the time this movie happens, it's the summer before last that he was mad about. So it should be called \"I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last\". Or, if the killer is now mad about both summers, it should be \"I Know What You Did For The Past Two Summers\". Or, if the new killer is only mad about last summer, but indifferent to the previous summer, it should be called \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", just like the first movie. Or, to cover all the bases, maybe it should be, \"I Always Know What You Do In The Summer, And It Always Pisses Me Off\". Just a thought.", "label": 0}

The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.\nIf you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced.

According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror.

{"text": "(NOTE: Partial spoilers of earlier movie)\nI'll rank this a three on a 1-5 scale I've devised particularly for use in rating sequels for which I liked the original. The scale would work as follows: 1: So bad I'd now just as soon have not liked the original. 2: My liking for original is intact, but sequel adds virtually nothing to my enjoyment. 3: Sequel enjoyable mainly on the strength of how original made me care for the characters and their continuing story, not a great movie in its own right. 4: Sequel satisfying, coming close to or rivaling the original in quality. 5: Exceptional sequel, surpassing the original in quality. So, in the case of this movie, the sequel leaves considerable room for disappointment but maintained my interest because the first made the characters interesting. Even at that, Jennifer Love Hewitt came much closer to having to carry the movie this time, because Freddy Prinze, Jr. was reduced to cameo-level appearance this time, and most of the rest of major players in the original played characters that didn't survive that movie. Particularly missed in the sequel for the latter reason were Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and especially the undercast Brigette Wilson. Other things that detracted from this sequel are that the screenplay, editing, and/or direction seemed amateurish at times. The main Character Julie (played by Hewitt) sings \"I Will Survive\" as a karaoke song, a scene better omitted. I can't speak for viewers unfamiliar with karaoke, though I suspect they might have limited appreciation for its inclusion in movies. But those of us who are karaoke singers and/or listeners know that \"I Will Survive\" is one of the most run-into-the-ground of karaoke songs and we're sick of it. Also her scene where she gets into the sunlamp box is also awkward and probable not too pleasing to anyone. Those not liking scantily-clad scenes will find it \"exploitative\", but those who do will find it tame and unrevealing. Other awkward moments would become ponderous to enumerate. Julie's new boyfriend in the movie, who accompanies her to the Bahamas (the reason for Prinze's sparse appearence in this) is played in an awkward way, and his character's transitions along plot twists are lame and not highly believable. As for the scenes set in the Bahamas, they were actually filmed in Mexico and it shows. They show good-sized mountains, non-existent in the Bahamas. But in that department, this sequel in no way outdoes the original in impertinance, for the original had some mountain scenes too, even though ostensibly set in and around Southport, NC, an area where all land within view is at least as flat as the Bahamas. The most memorable new character in this sequel, though even he has been called ineffective and/or miscast, is a resident pothead in the Bahamas, played by Jack Black. His character has some mildly funny moments, though they missed a chance to give him what could have been the movie's funniest line. In the movie, most every character at one time or another falls under suspicion of being the killer on the lose; when it came the pothead's turn to be suspected, he should have said, \"Don't look at me - I don't even know what I did last summer!\" The end of the movie seems a possible set up for still another sequel. If one is made, I hope it can come closer to recapturing the quality of the original rather than languishing at the level of this first sequel.", "label": 2}

Yes it was nice seeing Alice and Valentie (pretty faces and nice bodies to attract the boys) kick some butt, ill admit, but when you actualy go to the lengths of stealing another persons movie idea you'd think they could at least make the plot work (i.e. to reanimate dead bodies they MUST be infected with the T-Virus, yet when the wayward team are running through a grave yard, corpes come up from the ground.

Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.\n\nMy problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.\n\nI did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.\n\nThis soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being \"too loud and blatty.\" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again.

{"text": "Few philosophers are renowned for their guidance in military tactics or their competence as men of the battlefield. Considering that such men excel in the art of brutal killing, they seem an odd category of people to recommend to the masses the right methods of life. A large part of the population have for long wisdom of such men, Niccol Machiavelli and Sun Tzu springing readily to mind, as they are seen as playing the devil's advocate for the cruel rulers they guide. However demented or wise these men may be, they without doubt shaped the political and social structure of their government and their influence has carried on even to our era. Among such men, the case of the protagonist of Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is an unusual one; a ronin-a samurai without a Lord or House to serve-as the political and military philosopher. His text on military strategy, The Book of Five Rings, is still being read and scrutinized in many areas, from philosophy to business.\n\nA famed swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto, was an unbeatable warrior whose legacy carries on as one of the most rebellious and intriguing men of his time. Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is the first segment of a trilogy of films depicting Musashi's life; as it is the first segment it focuses on his early exploits to become a samurai. Following the loss of his side at the Battle of Sekigahara, he takes refugee with his fellow friend, Honiden Matahachi, at the house of a widow and her daughter. The daughter and widow fall in love with Musashi due to his swordsmanship that kills, injures, and scares of a large portion of the ronin that demands favors such as money, food, jewelry-especially Gold-to leave them unharmed. He rejects both women while Matahachi attaches himself to the women, even though he has promised to return to his faithful fianc. Angered by this event, Musashi returns to his village to inform Matahachi's mother and fianc of his whereabouts.\nAs in many other classic Samurai films,  Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto contains great acting, by the likes of no other than Toshiro Mifune, an able director, and carefully chosen settings. Even with all the good performances and genuinely fine screenplay, based on a contemporary Japanese novel of Musashi's life, the film is ultimately forgettable. Undeniably, the film simply aims at describing Musashi's earliest years, but in turn creates a work that could only interest fans of Musashi Myamoto rather than the average filmgoer. What really drains the film is the lack of comprehension of Musashi's true talent and vigor; on the surface he seems indistinguishable from countless samurai of other samurai flicks. Granted that he may be a shallow samurai, no insight or philosophy is assigned to character. It is quite unexplained why he hates the village and its inhabitants as much as he does. Without some insight about the true significance of Musashi, the audience of the film will be more confused at the significance of this character that seems to lack any significant characteristic worth caring for.\n\nStrangely, the film succeeds in making Musashi look like a complete loon and fool, and not a believable one. In the hunt that ensues, he succeeds in overpowering nearly everyone, but surrenders himself to the Priest with no opposition; it is not the surrender that is strange, but the method of surrender which is so spiritless and uncharacteristic of the samurai character that Musashi so eagerly demands to achieve. If that wasn't enough, Musashi is deceived a second time by the Priest who caused him so much suffering and humiliation. Unfortunately, the story line may be believable and acceptable in the novel that the film is based on, but many of the film's developments seem to embarrassingly display the filmmaker's inability of giving the work an acceptable ending.\n\nSamurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is insignificant not because Musashi's himself is not interesting for the contemporary viewer, far from it, but because he is utterly identical to every other samurai you have seen. As it is shown, he is a great swordsman, but, then again, are not all samurai? As much as Toshiro Mifune attempts to show us the rebellious, and eventual moral character, of Musashi we are at a loss, because the script is so thinly developed that even the noblest efforts of the entire cast combined can not make the film the great picture that it truly deserves to be. Surprisingly, Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto was presented with Academy  Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 28th (1955) Oscars; however, odd a selection this may be, it is not nearly as strange why the following two segment of the trilogy were devoid of such honors.", "label": 2}

It's entertainment but for me it's much than that I'm able to receive a better understanding of my Bible it's like a learning process to test me on my Bible knowledge and see how well I know the scriptures, for instance when I'm able to pick something out of the movie that may not be quite true to scripture I go check my Bible and I'm able to learn my scriptures better and my Bible. I believe by watching the DVD over and over and even having different versions you absorb more into your memory and it can be your own individual Bible study.

{"text": "I've been wanting to watch this version of JE for years. Despite seeing scores of negative reviews here, I thought to myself--it can't possibly be that bad. It was made back in A&E's classics heyday. [Remember when A&E once stood for Arts & Entertainment? But I diverge.] It's stars Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. It's Jane Eyre! How could it possibly be mucked up?\n\nDespite having everything going for it, this version doesn't live up to expectations. There are several reasons for this:\n\n~The atmosphere. You won't feel submerged in Jane's world. The sets and costumes look cheap. What is more, the gothic touches are missing. For example, the red room sequence. The camera just flashes around the room-but it doesn't show us the shadows, the things Jane imagines, that make her scared. It's just a room.\n\n~the script. JE is dense book so not everything is going to be able to be packed in a two hour movie but too much was left out of this movie. Where is the gypsy scene? Where is Jane's discovery that she is not solely an orphan but has family? Where's Jane's conversations with Mrs. Reed when she returns home? Even on a basic level, the script suffers--rather than develop plot points, it just jumps to them as the story requires. For example, the St. John sequence is too short. The Blanche Ingram sequence is especially undeveloped.\n\n~the acting. Samantha Morton is the saving grace of this production. Her Jane is gentle but formidable, quiet but with a backbone. Ciaran Hinds is not a one-note actor, but as Mr. Rochester, he is only shown as being agitated, spiteful and mean. Even when he is kind, he is cruel. Jane would never fall in love with this Rochester.\n\nAt times, it also feels like a parody. The parody elements particularly come through in the handling of Bertha Rochester. It's like watching a Monty Python sketch when she's onscreen.\n\nIn short, this is a dud! It's worth watching in order to be able the appreciate how good the 06 version is. Also, if you are in the know about BBC programs, it can amusing to watch just to see the once and future Captain Wentworths both featured in the same production. Otherwise, skip it.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This was the first time I have ever watched TAXI DRIVER. Even though I've become a true movie buff / entrepreneur, I realize that sometimes it's better to never watch these \"classic\" films and simply imagine what they were like in its place and time, than watching them nowadays for the first time with expectations that won't deliver the goods. There are so many of my favorites that came from this time (the 60's) in film history. But the catch is I watched them back then, which makes me appreciate them more now, rather than watching them now, which appreciates me back then. Am I saying that TAXI DRIVER is a bad film? Not exactly.  Did I really watch this movie? Indubitably!\n\nThe best part about this flick was seeing younger versions of Rupert Da Nero, Harvey Guitar and Jody \"Cannon\" Fodder. It's been awhile since I've seen Cyborg Sheepherder too, apparently she's been packing on the chunks over the years, but I haven't seen her myself. It was also great to see Peter Boppins (may he nap peacefully) but I'm beginning to wonder if the man ever had a full skull of working hair follicles. I love Skadaisy's work and own nearly two of his films on HD-DVD. There's no question that what he and Da Nero created here was pure brilliance at the time and again, had I watched this film way back when I was born, I would've understood this stuff much more clearly, but in this day and age a lot about the film just isn't relevant anymore (At one point the guy pays a prostitute with just a twenty dollar bill! The movie about lost me here).\n\nA couple of positive things that really stood out in the movie were the relationship between \"Slick\" Travis and Ole' Bootsy and the conversation that took place between Travis and the secret service \"dude\" in Las Vegas. With Travis and Bootsy, well, most people would call Travis a clear-cut hopeless romantic and some of his more colourful ideas he shares with her certainly show this. But this brings me to my first issue, the dude's an underdog taxi driver and she's a successful geologist with options, I just don't see that combo ever cutting the slice. And who in their right mind takes a high society chick (or any chick) around town in a taxi on their first date? But I will say that taking her to a dirty movie was a classy move on his part, even thought she wasn't getting into it like he was. And as for the secret service guy, why did he wait so long to try and apprehend Travis? Red flags galore were going off during their poker game, more than enough to get a dude shot in the face these days, and considering how he gave the guy his real name (Henry Krinckle) and what I think was his real address (123 Fake Street), I don't understand why they weren't beating down his door with handcuffs and tasers.\n\nTAXI DRIVER is an interesting love story, although our main protagonist is clearly supposed to be a likeable character, I had a hard time rooting for him, let alone understanding how things managed to keep working out in his favor throughout the film (except the ending, he totally got what he deserved). I do think they captured the loneliness of working in a factory right on the money, but as far as Travis being a war veteran, well I wasn't completely sold on that. The Hurt Locker was the best journey into the unstable mind of Vietnam Vets for me and I just didn't think Travis came off as that type of person. I will say this though, that all out b/a/l/l/s-to-the-walls dance off at the end was totally awesome. Hip-yeah!\n\n*All fact checking and proof reading was done by Justin Palmure*", "label": 2}

{"text": "The 1980's were an era that mass produced more... screwball comedies than ever before. It was also the era that movies filled with mega-violence were made and cloned more quickly than mulitpling mosquitoes.[I thought] one of these such films was BLUE THUNDER.\n\nBLUE THUNDER has all the elements of many of those violent 1980s films. The lead character is a Vietnam vet struggling with vivid flashbacks. He has a comical sidekick (in this case played by Daniel Sterns) who is murdered about halfway through the picture. The lead character ends up getting caught up in a plot that runs deeper than he originally imagined that ends up leading all the way to some secret government sector or plot. In the end the hero takes things into his own hands and goes on a rampage to get the bad guys and set things right and is cleared of all wrong doing, accused or actual.\n\nRoy Scheider stars in the film as L.A.P.D. aero-division pilot Frank Murphy. Schneider does a decent job considered the material he was given. Besides one feels an immediate kinship to anything Scheider acts in; this is the guy that killed Jaws. His sidekick in the film is a young Daniel Sterns (before he gained fame with \"The Wonder Years\" and HOME ALONE) and he does a good job playing the greenhorn.\n\nHowever, neither Scheider or Sterns is the star of this movie. They are both second billing to a super-duper armed police helicopter called (you guessed it), BLUE THUNDER. You see Blue Thunder was created by the government to keep us rebellious citizens in line and to protect people at the 1984 Olympic Games in L.A. However, some really evil guys planned to use the machine for alternative purposes to help \"keep order\" (hint, hint). This chopter has armor, can sense heat, shoots a lot of bullets really fast, and can hear and see through walls. She's the star.\n\nOverall, the movie's not all that good or bad. The movie starts off slow but picks up after the first half hour racing steam until the exploding, yet let down of a conclusion.", "label": 2}

On a crystal clear summer night, average citizens witness what appear to be UFOs in the sky.  For some the UFOs affect them more than others.  A child, his mother, Richard Dreyfuss, and a dozen other unnamed people begin seeing visions in their head.  They see a geographical structure, but can't make sense of it.  Later they find out it is Devil's Tower in the west.  Cut between these stories are small stories of strange events happening across the world; stretching from Mexico to India.  In the middle of the Gobi desert, a seaship is found.\nFinally our heros, Richard Dreyfuss and a woman reach the Devil's Tower for the climax.  The climax is enjoyable if one of able to make sense of it.  Some people will look at it and say, \"Wow look at all the pretty spaceships!\"  Maybe Speilberg was trying to entertain and mystify us for two hours, which he does at certain momements.  I guess what he's trying to say is, \"Aliens are not harmful.

A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three \"ghosts\" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the \"romantic\" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

{"text": "The Eyes of Laura Mars, 1978 film\n\nThe story begins with someone looking at a book of pictures, then cutting one out. Then a woman is attacked with a knife. Later another woman gets out of bed and looks at a book of pictures. She makes a phone call, but gets no answer. Is photography just a hype for advertising? [Yes, and records facts and fictions.] Are provocative photographs a form of art? [Yes.] One man doesn't like these pictures. Someone has been murdered, she was the editor of Laura Mars' photobook. The next day the models are prepared for a photo shoot. Laura uses a Polaroid camera for test shots outdoors, Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Sex and Violence! Then Laura has a vision, or dizziness. Did she have breakfast? We see street traffic in New York City. Then Laura has another vision. The police detective questions her.\n\nThe models and help are in the police station while Laura is questioned. Laura takes pictures of reality, as defined by her camera. Some of Laura's art photos resemble crime scene pictures, and the police are interested. The police find a man's clothes in the murdered woman's closet. They belong to her ex-husband Michael Reisler. He is a writer who has returned from San Francisco. On location Laura has another vision! [Or a hallucination?] We see models being prepared for photography (you just don't push a button). Laura has another vision! [Is she overworked?] Lt. John Neville interviews two models of Laura Mars. [Pill-popping airheads?] While developing pictures she has another vision about those two models, Michelle & Lulu. She goes to their funerals. News photographers show up for \"human interest\". Lt. Neville gets closer to Laura. John offers a revolver to Laura for her protection. At a birthday party Laura gets a phone call from Michael, and uses a double to escape police surveillance. A mistake?\n\nLt. Neville gets a call about a suspect. The police search the apartment of Laura's employee. He tells what he saw in the basement. \"He pulled a knife on me!\" There is a chase and a shooting. Tommy won't talk. Its over. Lt. Neville visits Laura. But Laura has another vision! There is pounding on her door! Should \"death\" be used to sell things? [Life insurance?] Lt. Neville explains why Tommy acted that way. His talk alarms Laura! She runs to her bedroom and gets her revolver. There is a tense moment. \"If you love me, please kill me!\" There is a shot and a body falls to the floor. Next a phone call to report a death. The caller provides a name. [The ending reminds me of \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\".]\n\nThe photographs were taken by Helmut Newton, a fashion photographer whose work featured sex and violence to grab eyeballs. [Whatever happened to him?] This could be a better movie with a better story, it falls down in the end. It seems to be a lower-budget movie, created from a short story whose adaption to a movie reveals its flaws. One value of this movie is its expose of the way shocking photographs are used for advertising in some style magazines. Around this time they published a book with the photographs of \"Weegee\", a news photographer from the 1930s-1950s famous for his pictures of murder victims on the sidewalks of New York.

{"text": "Though an ultimate disappointment to AVENGERS fans, and especially to viewers being first introduced to the AVENGERS mythos, the film at least takes a while to show its bad side.  The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.\nThe main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.\nBy contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.\n(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is the second installment in the Resident Evil movie series and yet again it has been overdone. I've been a long time veteran of the games and have been very disappointed with how the directors brought it to the big screen. While the series is action packed and entertaining, the characters and their personalities are smeared all over the floor and they've reached too far to other crowds who probably aren't familiar with the series. After seeing the first film, I was apprehensive but still interested in seeing Apocalypse. I think they did a great job creating Nemesis and he was the best part of this film by far. Unfortunately the side story is mediocre and they totally destroyed all of the Resident Evil 3 characters I played as and loved. Jill Valentine (known as \"Valentine\" here) in the game is a cool, collected, smart gal with a pretty good intuition. In this movie she is a macho, loud-mouthed, jealous girl who lacks a warm personality and cusses up a storm. She's like Jill's evil twin sister. Carlos is a likeable character but he's totally an American in this movie. Both Nicolai and Mikhail (they call him something else in the movie) die very early on. Alice has always been exclusive to the film series, and while she is a good actress with an interesting back story, she was never in the games (to my knowledge).\n\nThe problem I have with these RE films is that they are way overdone - everybody is macho and fights to heavy metal or bad techno. It is totally to sell tickets. None of the characters share the humble qualities of inner strength and determination like in the games. There is no depth to anyone and it's hard to connect. The movie hits hard and leaves no lasting impressions. I keep thinking, \"less is more\", but that is not their philosophy - they want it all out on the table and leave nothing up to the viewers to be figured out.\n\nGood as entertainment for an hour and a half, but definitely not true to the series, nor does it do the games justice.

There are times when Hollywood takes EXTREME licenses with biblical stories, transforming them into something unrecognizable (i.e. Noah).  However, that is not the case with Joseph.  The movie stays very close to the biblical account with some minor addition added to enhance the story and to drive home a point.  It effectively demonstrated how God can take a circumstance that to us can seem evil and use to bring about good.  As for those people who were offended by the \"bath scene\", I say read story from Genesis again.  Potiphar's  wife pressured Joseph DAY AFTER DAY for sex. In order for the movie to drive this home effectively without being pornographic, it showed her attempting to seduce him while he was bathing.  Now the although this can be inappropriate for younger viewers, the reality is that it does not deviate drastically from the biblical account and it does not warrant the movie a bad review.  I'll tell anyone with very small children not to watch this with them until they are of an age where you are ready to talk to them about sexual issues.  The Bible is fill with stories of suffering, lost, pain, and redemption and sometimes these topics are hard to see on film.

{"text": "It goes without saying that \"Upstairs/Downstairs\" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a \"Harry Potter\" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled \"Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?\" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson \"Miss Marple\"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I recently saw the HBO miniseries \"John Adams\" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of \"John Adams\" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I can understand why a sequel was made to \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.\nThe sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).\nHere's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go \"Ohhhhh!!\"?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!\nAnother problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.\nOne more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?\nViewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).\nChalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of \"Scream.\"  While \"Scream\" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.

I have read reviews and documents about her and she seemed to be very confident, so I am not sure if she was portrayed correctly in the end. I would have liked the director to portray her as the hero she was. It's ok to leave the audience with the question, was she a hero or not, and it's ok to let her question herself in the film, but she should've believed in the purpose of God in the end. That's a true hero and saint. I guess it's all about what you believe and I think that she died knowing that GOD actually used her, but I know that most people would be afraid to die because of your belief. I am just sorry she had to be burned at a such a young age. How sad and frieghtening. If you haven't seen the movie yet, judge for yourself, but I don't think this movie had a great ending.

That's basically it.\n\nInsofar as these types of films go, this one isn't terrible.  It does have its strengths.  Being underground for the majority of the film, there is a creepy, middle-of-the-night atmosphere to it that kind of works (kind of).

{"text": "I think that anyone who went to see 'Resident Evil' expecting character development or a witty script are foolish.  This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.\nFirst of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.\nStill, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.\nAlthough this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.", "label": 2}

To my disbelief, this film actually had a decent plot and was told in an interesting enough manner, to keep me fully attentive during the over-drawn portions of the film(and there are many).\n\nThe film takes place in Tokyo and we are immediatly introduced to Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her boyfriend Doug.  They are foreign exchange students attending college and adapting to their new surroundings.  Karen is a social worker and is sent on her first case.  She is to take care of an elderly woman, struggling from what the doctors believe to be dementia.  Well, they are wrong.  As Karen finds out, there is something very wrong with the house this woman is living in and KAren apparently feels it the moment she walks in.  After a hair-raising evening, Karen is sent to a hospital so that she can be kept close watch on.  Oddly enough, the horror and images Karen saw in the house are now following her and won't leave her alone.  In fact, these images are following everyone that has visited the house, including the detectives sent in to see what was going on.  Why?  Did something happen in that house years ago??  Who is the little boy, that is just waaaaaaay too creepy???\n\nThese are the questions that will be answered throughout the remainder of the film.\n\n\"The Grudge\" does a pretty good job of keeping the viewer rather tense and on the egde of their seat.  This film is another example of the Japanese horror film gone AMerican and I am very curious to see the original Japanese version of this film, as I feel that it would rely much less on the special effects for the scares.  No gore in this film and although the images are scary, our two villians are a little Japanese boy and his mother----not really the sort of folks that will give you nightmares.  It was a good decision to tell this story in non-linear form, as the plot would probably have been much duller and predictable had they not.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent film, certainly worth a viewing.  Not suitable for children as the depictions of ghosts are probably going to keep them up nights.\n\nEnjoy!", "label": 2}
{"text": "To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didn't even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.\n\nWhen it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didn't even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Fright Night is an enjoyable horror.  Its fast paced simple story keeps you watching as to how a young teenager tackles the fact that a vampire has moved in next door to him.  Fright Night is a very predictable 80's horror flick with bubbly performances from its teenager stars and the over exaggerated acting from its adult leads.  Don't get me wrong, the acting IS acceptable for this type of film and works well.  Keeping to the theme of the film, strange things start to happen (for example): a coffin is seen brought into the house next door, a mysterious man is seen with a woman and a body in a bag is seen dragged out of the house.  Of coarse this all leads up to one thing, that there is a vampire living in the next house and the frightened tenager tries to warn everybody before the vampire kills again.  It not surprising what happens next, as the vampire visits and fights back (but for some strange reason) with comedic effect.\n\nFright Night does have a lot of ridiculous but humerous moments with 80's style make up and special effects.  The special effects however, are quite good and impressive for its time.  Eventhough this film is very enjoyable and a good Halloween flick, it does have a couple of flaws.  One is that the story is very simple and dreary, while the second is that some parts of the film could have been done better.\n\nOverall, Fright Night is a forgetable film but it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Its a film I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.  So I gave it 3, as it will take me a while to watch again.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil is an onion of stupidity. It's just layer after layer after layer of the most retarded plot points, character dialogue and CG that I have ever been forced to sit through.\n\nThe story goes that under the streets of Racoon City there is a secret facility (The Hive) controlled by Umbrella (a massive pharmacutical company) which is designed for creating vast viral weaponry.\nAn outbreak occurs turing all the staff into flesh hungry zombies.\n\nNow to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful.\nI'm pretty much going to ruin the ending for anyone reading further than here so if you haven't seen the film and actually care about the end don't read any further.

Does she reveal ANY helpful information to these people who in all respects she should view as her masters?? NO!\nFirst she slaughters half the team in a laser grid based trap, and says \"You're all going to die down here.\" The laser trap was stupid because there is an area of about 3 feet by the entrance to Red Queen's chamber where the laser grids can't reach. The leader of the security group is safe for a bit and actually backs up so he can get cut to pieces like the rest of his team.\n\nThen after all the zombies have been released, you see these shambling corpses with bite marks, and half eaten faces.

So they all should have become zombies at the same time, which would give them no reason to feed on one another.\n\nThe whole Alice in Wonderland fixation is a waste as well.\nElevator behind the mirror (looking glass), main character's name (Alice), going underground/down the rabbit hole), Red Queen.

{"text": "I find that as I view this film over and over again that their just a mixture of feelings towards the film. At first I tend to focus on all the wrong like most people do. The movie completely transforms and warps Joan's childhood. There was no attack on her village and she never witnessed her sister getting raped that part is clear. As for the giant spinning propellers,although they might make for an awesome scene, are completely false to the times of which the period is placed. The las and most important falsehood given in the film is the way we view Joan herself. In the movie we witness her as the extremely hot headed border line luney bin character. Where as it is reported many times in history that she was calm and actually quite most of the time. By the director changing Joan's childhood it makes it seem as if most of the reason Joan is doing this is for hidden revenge. Although all these are pretty heavy crimes against history they do manage to add some historical accurate details into the film. The use of muder holes and other siege weapons (trebuchet, siege ladders, siege towers) all of these are well displayed within the movie. So if your going to buy this film it comes down to what you want in this movie. If your an action packed awesome fight scenes kind of person you'll love the movie for what it is.

{"text": "Four stars for screenplay writing, technical execution and acting:\nThe well-written Oliver Stone screenplay vaulted him into his screenwriting and directing career. Likewise, the film vaulted Alan Parker who had directed commercials and several short films, into his feature film career. Brad Davis was also a first-timer in a major role and his performance was stellar, with a promising career wasted and cut short by uncontrolled drug abuse and contracting aids. Not surprising it was nominated for numerous Oscars, as the story they filmed was compelling. Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not often consider how a film represented to the public as a true story actually aligns with the real facts.\n\nOne Star for Gross Inaccuracy:\nGranted, it wasn't a documentary, or even a docu-drama, but it was marketed as the story about William Hayes, his arrest, imprisonment, and subsequent escape. The problem is not \"artistic license\" liberties with minor details and conflation (e.g. combining characters or locations) to reduce scope and run time. The problem is the film doesn't much resemble what actually occurred other than Hayes being arrested for smuggling hashish at the airport, being tried for it, being convicted and sentenced for it, being re-sentenced to a longer prison term, and escaping to Greece some years later. Nearly everything else that fleshes out the story is a fabrication, gross exaggeration, or gross caricature. The Turkish criminal justice and prison system leaves much to be desired, and it does suffer from some corruption, but it's not nearly the kind of capricious judicial decision-making or the level of depraved, sadistic cruelty depicted in the movie. The real story isn't quite as compelling and has a tougher time garnering sympathy for the protagonist. Knowing the factual events of Hayes' arrest, trial and imprisonment, I don't have much sympathy for what he actually suffered in the Turkish prisons. He was 23 years old, knew what he was doing was a crime (and not a trivial one), and intuitively knew the punishment could be quite severe if he were caught and arrested in Turkey for smuggling roughly 2 kilos (4 pounds) of hashish. It's not drug kingpin quantity, but it's way beyond attempting to claim it was a \"personal use\" quantity. He cannot claim 18-19 year old naivety either. Nor was he coerced, cajoled or persuaded by someone else to mule the drugs for them. In short, all William Hayes' suffering was entirely self-inflicted by his own, conscious decisions. Although he had been re-sentenced from 4 years plus some months for possession to 30 years for smuggling, it's quite certain he would have been released within couple years after his escape. Nevertheless, Turkey was then and still is a country with harsh drug dealing and drug smuggling laws. Had the film been represented as a complete fiction, with fictional characters in a semi-fictional mid-east country, it would be much more acceptable. That wouldn't have marketed as well though.\n\nThis movie should be viewed as a complete fiction. On that basis it holds up as a very good adventure thriller, albeit with a very flawed protagonist. It utterly fails as any resemblance to the true story about William Hayes.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Coming off the turkey that was \"Alien Vs. Predator\", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as \"substance\" and \"content\" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.\n\nStarting where the original \"Resident\" left off, \"Apocalypse\" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called \"Nemesis\" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.\n\nWhile \"Apocalypse\" plays out like a mix of \"Charlie's Angels\" and the \"Dawn Of The Dead\" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well. While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that \"Apocalypse\" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel.

{"text": "I found this horror film watchable, but still it disappointed me a little as it is nowhere near the level of \"The Ring\". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.\n\nPRECISION: I never watched the original \"Ju-on: the grudge\" Japanese version so I am unable to compare it to this American remake.\n\nKaren Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is an American nurse living and working in Tokyo. She is efficient and hardworking and therefore she handles already numerous assignments, but her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) asks her to take one more patient, an aged American woman named Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie). Emma lives alone in a large and old (by Tokyo's standards) house and she needs care because she suffers from dementia and lethargy  - or Yoko (Yoko Maki), the usually very reliable previous nurse assigned to her didn't report to work for a couple of days...\n\nThis actually is not the real beginning of the story, because the action of this film is as non-linear as it is humanly possible, with numerous flash-backs and with some new plots kicking in all the time - and that is precisely part of my problem with \"The Grudge\". Non-linear narration is a very excellent thing but only if the director keeps things under strict control - here it is not the case and even if the logic of the story is ultimately preserved it takes a great effort to keep up with the developments. Personally, considering that the film was not so good anyway, towards the end I didn't feel like making this effort anymore because all those narrative acrobatics tired me instead of intriguing...\n\nThe other problem I had with this film that, unlike the chillingly terrifying \"The Ring\", this film is hardly scary AT ALL. There is only a couple of really good scenes, but in a 92 minutes film it is not nearly enough.\n\nThe main strength of this film is in Sarah Michelle Gellar, who reveals herself here as a much better actress than usually believed - and of course she is still cute as a button, exactly as in \"Buffy\" TV series. Her character is likeable and clearly vulnerable (do not expect any martial arts) and therefore I was concerned about what will happen to her all the time - it was actually what kept me watching this thing until the very end...\n\nThe other asset is Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi), a tough, courageous and competent police officer who already had to do with Emma's house in the past and is clearly scared s***less by this place - but nevertheless will do his duty with cold, resigned resolution.\n\nStill, the good points notwithstanding, this is not a very successful film. Watchable, but nothing more and especially nowhere near the quality of \"The Ring\".", "label": 2}

{"text": "I hate all the reviewers and critics who say that \"fans of the video game are going to love this movie.\" These critics normally aren't gamers or fans of the source material, so how can they be an adequate judge of the tastes of gamers? I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil game franchise, the very person these critics believe that will enjoy the Resident Evil films. But I DESPISE these movies. And why, do you ask? Because they really aren't much like the games at all. Oh sure, there's a mansion, zombies, zombie dogs, a \"Licker\" creature, and the malignant Umbrella corporation. But aside from those aesthetical similarities, the film bears little resemblance to the games.\n\nWhen preproduction of the first Resident Evil film began, the legendary George Romero, whose Dead franchise was a major inspiration for the Resident Evil games, was commissioned to write a script. His script shared many similarities to the game, such as the inclusion of characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. However, it also made changes to the story that game developers Capcom didn't like, and Romero was ultimately turned down. Instead, they hired Paul WS Anderson, director of Event Horizon and another video game movie, Mortal Kombat. His treatment was more like a prequel to the games, and this approach was more acceptable to Capcom's head honchos. Anderson's treatment was greenlit, and \"Resident Evil: Ground Zero\" went into production (the \"Ground Zero\" subtitle was abandoned after the events of September 11th).\n\nThe film begins in The Hive, a massive laboratory facility beneath Raccoon City. The mutagenic T-Virus is being tested in the labs, but someone releases the virus, infecting the hundreds of scientists within the facility. Sensing the outbreak, The Hive's security system, the artifically-intelligent Red Queen, locks down the facility and douses everyone in halon to further prevent their escape.\n\nWe switch to Alice (Milla Jovovich), who awakens in an empty mansion after passing out in the shower. Her collapse has has given her amnesia, a condition that becomes ever more frightening when a team of nameless Special Ops soldiers (see: fodder) employed by Umbrella storms the mansion. Turns out that the mansion serves as a secret entrance to The Hive, and the team has been sent to infiltrate The Hive and investigate its lockdown. The team directs Alice down into the bowels of the facility to assist with the task. Why they can't determine the nature of the lockdown from the outside is beyond me, since that would be a much more logical thing to do. And why can't they just trust the security system they created and leave The Hive locked down, rather than endangering the lives of an entire Special Ops team and potentially the lives of everyone on the outside by reopening the Hive? But as you're going to find out while watching the Resident Evil films, logic does not exist in this dojo.\n\nAnyway, Alice and the team discover that the T-Virus has turned everyone in The Hive into flesh-eating zombies, and they must get out of the facility before it is sealed up  permanently. But seeing the risk of letting them leave, the Red Queen isn't going to make it easy for them.\n\nThe Resident Evil games excel at creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, where you don't know what horrors are literally waiting around the corner. The main characters are given little ammunition to fend off the hordes of zombies and creatures salivating for their flesh, perpetuating a sense of doom and dread since the player must be methodical and conservative with their weapons. Writer/director Anderson attempts to establish a suspenseful mood by not even introducing the zombies until about halfway through the film. But sadly, all attepted suspense is lost once the flesheaters appear and the Covert Ops team whip out their big machine guns and blast away at them. The film becomes less about mood and scares and more about action and gunfire.\n\nThe emphasis on action increases once Alice begins regaining her memory, suddenly remembering that she is a martial arts expert who can run along walls, do flying kicks, and break necks with her thighs. It feels like her sparring partner was Trinity in The Matrix.\n\nIn fact, the film cribs a lot of elements from The Matrix Bargain Bin, such as references to Alice in Wonderland (Alice, the Red Queen, the entrance to The Hive is a mirror), wire-fu, slow-motion bullets, and a lead character who suddenly discovers that they have incredible abilities. The film also seems to \"borrow\" elements from other genre films like Cube and Day of the Dead, though it's hard to criticize the game for using elements of Romero's zombie films since the games themselves are inspired by them.\n\nThe film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.\n\nThis film is \"meh\". It isn't great, it isn't good, it isn't god-awful. It's quite derivative of other films it shouldn't be, and it lacks the elements that make the game so great. The acting is...well...there. It's also hard to care about characters who don't even have names. The only reason we know that Milla Jovovich's character is named Alice is because it's in the end credits. Characters are almost never addressed by their names during the film. So you feel almost completely indifferent when half the cast is killed off fairly early in the film. They all feel like nameless, faceless fodder, as bad as any cast of horny teens in any random 80's slasher film.\n\nThe highlights? The score and the rather humorous audio commentary of Anderson, Jovovich, producer Jeremy Bolt, and castmate Michelle Rodriguez. Jovovich sounds like she's in full \"valley girl\" mode here, and they joke about everything from Milla's gas (a little T.M.I. if you ask me), their time spent in a German nightclub (the film was shot mostly in Berlin), and cast member Eric Mabius' affinity for yogurt. But it says a lot about a film when one of the major highlights of the film is its audio commentary. After all, you don't watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because the movies they're riffing on are great.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I last watched this movie sometime back in the 80's when it used to be on regularly around Christmas time on TV. I loved this movie as it was an interesting and engaging alternative to the more common Scott and Finney versions of the classic Christmas Carol that always got the most airtime. It depicts depression era New England with a cold, grey feeling that really comes across the screen without bogging the movie down and having grown up in Boston, it makes it that much more intersting to me. The acting is top-notch, particularly from Henry Winkler. It was always one of my favorite Christmas specials. Then it went off the air never to return sometime back then (80's, 90's, I'm not sure exactly when) and I never forgot about it and often pined to watch it again but somehow always seemed to forget to look for it on VHS, DVD, or online. I stumbled onto it on Amazon via my Roku box and was delighted to see it again and purchased it so I can once again enjoy this teriffic movie with my kids! Any fan of A Christmas Carol (or just really good Christmas movies) should immediately get this movie in their collection!", "label": 1}

{"text": "2.5 Stars If Possible\n\nA year after the success of I Know What You Did Last Summer, JLH and FPJ are back in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  The first installment has the advantages of a better cast, more character development, a mysterious feeling, and originality, thus making it an all-around better movie.  I Still Know isn't all bad, but it doesn't live up to the previous effort, which itself wasn't anything amazing.\n\nThe cast isn't quite as good this time around.  It still has Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prince Jr. (as Julie James and Ray Bronson, respectively) but since Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe were killed off in the first film, the secondary couple is replaced by Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer, as Julie's best friend Karla Wilson and her boyfriend Tyrell.  There is little character development here.  I guess the writers just assumed everyone saw the first one and could figure out what was going on.\n\nI Still Know takes place one year after I Know and two years after the night where the four teens accidentally killed a man.  Julie and Karla win a trip for four to an island in the Bahamas.  Julie sees strange things hinting that the killer is there, but nobody else does so she can't convince then.\n\nThe killer stalks the teens and other random, innocent people along the way, including tough bartender Nancy (Jennifer Esposito) and bound-to-die stoner Titus Telesco (Jack Black).  Once dead bodies start popping up, people start to believe that there's a killer on the loose.\n\nAfter everything is seemingly settled, there is a little surprise at the end.  It nicely sets up for yet another sequel.  Nothing has been announced, but rumors for a trilogy have been speculated.\n\nI didn't like how the sense of mystery as to who the killer is was gone, since it was revealed in the previous film.  However, there were some twists and turns thrown in (one in particular comes to mind) that make the movie more exciting.\n\nI Still Know What You Did Last Summer was not as successful as it's predecessor.  This is understandable because, not only is it a sequel, but it simply isn't as good.  I would only recommend seeing this if you saw the first one and enjoyed it enough to sit through a something similar.", "label": 0}

While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role.  To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Standing on its own, the film is probably no worse and no better than the average action film: it's more an occasion for special effects,  unexpected situations, special effects, stylish banter, special effects, spectacularly  dispatching the villain, and more special effects than anything else. Seen  from that point of view, noone would complain much about Big Ben exploding  in such a spectacular manner when Sir August de Wynter lets loose his  out-and-out weather attack on London: it's just what this kind of film is  about. They only poison in jest, to borrow an expression\n  And seen from  that angle, noone would really expect anything out of the ordinary: it's  just a bit of fun, and need not be very believable. However, the comic  relief that most good action films  produce over a bit of unbelieavable  action is largely missing: the characters are too serious for that. There's  a fairly reasonable fencing scene at Trubshawe's, but when Mrs. Peel turns  her back on Steed and walks away from him, while still defending herself  against his attacks from behind, it goes over the line of being  belieavable, and turns into nothing more than a well choreographed action  sequence in a film, and so becomes a bit obtrusive: my suspension of  disbelief broke down very badly here.\n  I came to this film with a  considerable dose of the original Avengers in my memory: in particular the  years when Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel againt Patrick Macnee as John Steed.  That's probably unfair: the film cannot stand that kind of comparison.\n  The original relationship between Mrs. Peel and John Steed is gone. They're  no longer cooperating; instead Mrs. Peel is under grave suspicions of  sabotaging the Prospero weathershield, and Steed is to keep a check on her.  And so the occasionally bright patter, which in the original was more an  expression of the protagonists' relationship, here turns into something  more like fencing with sharp weapons.\n  Mother -- that rather poor  attempt to explain \"the Ministry\" for which the original Avengers  worked -- is here, and with Father, looking like Dr. Strangelove's twin  brother, as an extra burden:  one lame, the other blind. Again, my  disbelief-suspenders had a very  hard time with Father.  Colonel I. Jones  is more like the spirit of the original, but that may have something to do  with the fact that Patrick Macnee is \"appearing\" in that cameo  part.\n  It's a bit as if a film historian had found a set of reviews, and  some odd script fragments from the original TV series, and then set about  to recreate the original from those bits and pieces, while not entirely  being able to  free himself from an old dream of writing the next big James  Bond film.\n  The best way to appreciate this film is to forget the  original Avengers entirely, if possible.  Those who haven't seen the TV  episodes have a huge advantage here.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the \"We are assets, expendable assets\" line from Predator and \"Newt, I like that\" line from Aliens (although it's \"Angie, I like that\").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said \"Fight him\" and she said \"no\".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.

{"text": "I decided I had to get this movie based on all of the hype of an Oscar winner and a De Niro defining role after hearing that my new boss was named Hinkley.  A co-worker asked if that was the same name as the man who attempted to assassinate Reagan.  After looking up the Reagan assassination attempt and finding out it was Hinckley, rather than Hinkley, I also re-learned about his obsession with Jodie Foster in this movie and how it led to the assassination attempt.  She won (I was going to say earned, but not so much) an Oscar for her role in this movie and it has become a \"modern classic\".\n\nOverall, the story was nothing more than okay - a loner who is torn between his disgust of the seedier side of New York City and his inability to not be consumed by it.  His \"relationships\" with Cybill Shepard (very young and demure here) and Foster are at best superficial and barely explored.  The movie relies on a warped soundtrack that I was tempted to mute and go to subtitles because it was so annoying and the unusual cityscape of New York to propel it forward.  There was virtual no useful dialogue and none of the characters seemed to have any idea what they wanted or why they were where they were.\n\nHow Foster was even noticed by the Academy is a shock - she couldn't have been on screen for more than 6 minutes.  She was convincing enough as a young prostitute, but not at all compelling or memeroble in my opinion.  De Niro did a fine job as a near-lunatic ex-marine and he looked the part with a chisled body, but his headlong no-holds barred pursuit of Shepard in her office was completely out of character and not believable.  Even more unbelievable was that he would simply not be interested in her later in the movie, given where he was at that particular point in his life.\n\nFor her part, Shepard was not much more than eye-candy.  She was a necessary plot link between the streets of new York and the good Senator, but in the end served no greater purpose than that.\n\nThe climactic shoot-out was the only highlight in the movie and that's only if you can stomach some rather brutal imagery that makes you feel like you were there.  During the shootout, I wasn't really sure what I wanted the outcome to be.\n\nWhile I haven't seen all of the \"special\" features what I have seen so far was pretty plain vanilla fare with little to no great insight.  \"It was a movie that we had to make.\"  \"We didn't think anyone would watch it.\"  \"We really didn't talk much about what it meant, we all just knew.\"  It sounded as if they were just going through the motions.\n\nBottom line, I'm glad I watched it just to know what it was and to see the original \"You talkin' to me?\" scene, but definitely not a top-notch movie in my opinion.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Is it even possible to make a decent movie out of a video game? As we continue our tour of movies pre-made from video games, we're starting to doubt that. Video games have already revealed everything. Where can the movie go and stay true to the video game (assuming \"staying true\" has any meaning in such circumstances). In RS2 we're given every genre gimmick and stereo-type in the book trying to flesh out a story that is already very well-known. Nothing can ever succeed on that basis. Good movies--great movies--are new, strange, and exciting. The writing needs to go in utterly new directions to be meaningful. It's a tremendous risk... and probably one the studios are unwilling to take. But there is a precedent. Shakespeare himself took stories--well-known stories--and wove them in new ways to create the greatest stage-plays ever written. Is this so entirely different from taking concepts from video games and putting them on the screen? Video games provide a shorthand and background that screenwriters could exploit if they chose. Instead, the choose to exploit a too-willing audience.\n\nWHO SHOULD SEE THIS\n\nAs we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.\n\nWHO SHOULD AVOID\n\nThe goal of Inchoatus is to elevate the genre. We're founded precisely to encourage people to avoid films precisely like this. There are actually some decent films out there that feature blood, nudity, and fighting. Conan the Barbarian is an excellent example. The Event Horizon is another. Even Underworld had some merit to it. The anim film Ghost in a Shell is a tremendous film. As the core audience for all things speculative fiction, we don't have to automatically succumb to this kind of stuff just because they market it. If we can just muster the strength to show a little resistance to this kind of schlock, producers will be forced to provide something better. Is there a better reason to avoid seeing this film? We think not.\n\nObviously, anyone who isn't well and truly immersed in zombie movies or horror flicks--or has a very serious thing for Milla Jovavich--should avoid this film.\n\nREAD THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM", "label": 0}

Jojovich is credible, but tied by the director's vision of a ranting and revengeful mad woman.  I saw a preview trailer that was simple (the child Joan swinging a sword in a field, topping off flowers) that was more evocative than the film.

It's an oldie with good acting and whatnot, but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons:\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!!\nINTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A BLANK.\n\nIn no specific order:\n\n1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.\n\n2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.\n\n3. The movie doesn't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme....which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact. So basically that part of the plot goes like this: He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life's of the city aka drug dealers, prostitution, etc etc. Then he trains with a few guns that he bought, then one day he just decides okay it's time to do it. Then he goes and kills three criminals. Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes. You're left confused till the very end and it's not a clever setup either.\n\n4. There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene. Scenes like:\na) He fell in love with this blond, which dumped him.\nb) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond.\nc) The scenes with the other cab drivers, never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer.\nd) Scenes of him training, did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys???? Thought he was going to take out an army or something, totally anti-climatic.\ne) Most of the cab scenes, read the following below.\n\n5. The movie, I felt, did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver. Why do I feel this way? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew, could have been done, felt, or known even without being a Taxi Driver. Let's go deeper. He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it. You don't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this. A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver, using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy, etc.\n\nThinking back on that movie, the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him, but even that I felt was useless. And this scene alone confuses the plot, not help clarifies anything. He knows nothing of the guy, how can he be a supporter?\n\nSo what? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he's a hero? What the heck? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes? It's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior. CRAP!!\n\nThe acting was good, but the movie, IMO, is not that great. It was probably a good oldie, but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I am a bit of an American War Of Independance buff and this movie at least attempted to address one fault shared by most films on the subject, the Rebels themselves or Patriots is perhaps a better word were not all naturalised Yankee Accented Americans. Apart from Al Pacino's messy film, Revolution, every film i had seen until this one had the usual upper class Brit accent for the Redcoats and Traditional American drawl for the Patriots. The ranks of the Continental army included Ex-British soldiers and officers of the French Indian war,outraged by the policies and taxes levied by King George. Imagine the anger these men must have felt at having fought the French to protect King Georges interests in America, only then to be asked to pay for the pleasure through unfair and extortianate taxes. Add to this British settlers equally outraged at not being allowed to be represented in Parliament, plus naturalised Americans, Irish, Scots, Dutch, French and German settlers. Two contrasting scenes show the divisions within the American Colonies. When George Washington tells the owner of the boats he is borrowing them, the boat owner protests and tells the Continental Army that they are all mad and will hang. Contrast this with the Englishman who offers George Washington and his Officers the use of his house for shelter and food. Whilst i enjoyed this movie, particularly the portrayal of Washingtons officers having varying American,English,Scottish and Irish accents, i thought one scene was absolutely unescessary and it is fictional. Horatio Gates was as as British as they come, but he did join the fight against his King and became a celebrated though sometimes controversial figure of the Revolution. Most of the controversy is based on his opposition to George Washingtons military tactics, Gates favoured Guerilla tactics in the early stages as he was of the opinion, and its a well founded one, that the Continental Army at this stage was neither strong enough or equipped to fight Redcoats or Hessians head on. Of course we know that on this occasion he was proved wrong, but the scene where he is ordered out of the camp under threat of being shot is pure fiction. Gates left of his own accord but i got the feeling that the Director or screenwriter realised that they hadn't show a stereotyped bad-guy Brit in the movie and decided to add this scene to address that. Portraying Gates as a pompous snob was off the mark and an insult to a man who distinguished himself during the war. Still I just hope that one day someone will produce at last a decent movie or mini-series which accurately portrays a defining point in World history. But most of all a film needs to be made which pays tribute to the men and women of that period in history who suffered so much to give birth to a new nation, it needs to show that Americans were born of a variety of peoples and nations within the former colonies. Perhaps another thing which should be looked at is the effect on the Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, in England the Colonists had provoked a lot of sympathy amongst the working class and even Fifth columnists had formed to oppose King George, so much about this conflict remains unexplored on film and its a shame. It was all of these things, a struggle for human rights, equality, freedom. greed,ambition and even as suggested by many historians, a civil war. Probably the most complex and fascinating War or Conflict in history, surely one day filmakers will do it justice ?", "label": 2}

This is the first time I have seen anybody  delve into Joan's character as a possible schizo / mentally ill person --  and I love how she begins to figure out that she is a nut case as her world  comes crumbling down.  Of course, if you are a romantic and choose to  believe in the myth of Joan of Arc, then it leaves you enough tidbits to  keep carrying on that vision -- Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the Devil.", "label": 2}

Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero.

Lots of silly,  fictitious stuff was added about the various people at court who supposedly  convinced Charles to betray Joan.

Joan was played as if she were  constantly about to fall down sobbing and have a nervous breakdown.  She  came across as a total nutcase.  There's no way anyone would have followed  Joan if  she acted the way she was portrayed here.\nThere were also many  unintentionally funny parts.

{"text": "Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)\nIt's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.\nThere is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)\nJulia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies.

{"text": "Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'.

{"text": "The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.\n\nAt certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.\n\nWhat was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"\n\nAnother reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?\n\nAnd what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?\n\nSome of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.\n\nI will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.\n\nAnd the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.\n\nThe story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?\n\nSeeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.\n\nIf you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.", "label": 0}

Bresson's direction and pacing are not sure enough for this to be a quality film, but his story of a conflicted, manic Joan nevertheless has appeal. I have often wondered how Saints were in real life. Bresson's Joan is both self-confident and self-effacing.  Her self-confidence wins her fame, but it is her honest examination of conscience, her total self-effacement that ultimately makes her a Saint. Joan loves God passionately; her spirituality is real. She eschews amulets as a false and facile form of spirituality.  But she is still fallen in her humanity (as all saints are) and her motives to serve God are perhaps tinged with pride and, possibly, a desire for revenge.

Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems.\n\nBoth countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor.\n\nAlthough there are records of both of Joan's trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation.\n\nWhat hurts \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in \"Leon\". This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history.  And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.\n\nBut once Milla Jovovich's grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see \"The Dummy\") rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama.\n\nBut it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.", "label": 2}

If Resident Evil the Movie is the only exposure to it you have had, I pity you.  When judged individually as cinematic creation, I think this movie fails in a number of fields.  However, if you consider just the content of this movie, it does contribute vital material to the RE universe that all of us non-T-virus infected individuals can extrapolate into our own little Raccoon Cities.  For example, I think Milla's character COULD be a very good addition to the RE cast. It seemed to me she had some depth that Jovovich herself, fans, or writers could have some fun with in the future.  That's one of the neat things about having enough electricity in the ol' melon, even if something (like a mediocre movie) isn't totally enthralling by itself, we can find something interesting WITHIN it.\nI found interesting things in RE the Movie and I thought it was worthwhile to see it.  If you are a true Biohazard (they really should have kept that) fan, then I don't need to give you any input about buying the DVD...I hope you already have.  If you have not had much exposure to the RE universe then I recommend spending a few dark, lonely nights with the games or Stephani D. Perry's excellent novels.

{"text": "For some odd reason, the 1980s was the decade for the \"character machine,\" where audiences became engrossed in the capability and technology of a vehicle almost to the point of the vehicle becoming a major star or protagonist in the film. Blue Thunder is in my opinion the epitome of this phenomenon, along with The General Lee (Dukes of Hazard), Airwolf, Street Hawk, Firefox, KITT (Knight Rider), Back to the Future's DeLorean DMC-12, Time Rider, and to a lesser extent, B.A. Baracas' van (\"The A-Team\") and the Ferraris of Magnum PI and Miami Vice. Blue Thunder is an action flick at its core, with some plot holes and over the top stunt work, but contextualized properly, is a fun film. Very few models were employed to make the film (yes, Blue Thunder was a fully functional flying modified A&eacute;rospatiale Gazelle), and the blue screening effect to make it seem like Roy Scheider is actually piloting the chopper is surprisingly good. If you see this film, do so with the understanding that it wasn't about character development, acting, etc. but it was a stunt film for stunt fans. And for 1983 the stunts are pretty good.

{"text": "Sorry guys, bear with me, this is a long review, but if you want to know why I gave two stars you will have to read the entire thing.\n\nLet me first state that unlike many people, especially fans of the Resident Evil game series, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and although it wasn't anything too special or original, I felt the it was a solid action/sci-fi/zombie/horror movie which never really went wrong.  RE - Apocalpyse however disappointed me numerous times.  I excepted a generic plot, I expected Matrix style action, I expected hordes of zombies, I expected a lot of things, what I didn't expect were some lame scenes and a lazy plot wrap up.\n\nThe gist of the story is that a zombie creating virus has infected the Umbrella Corporation's secret research facility known as The Hive which resides underneath the city of Racoon City (the events of the first movie).  Of course a science team goes to reopen the Hive and the bad stuff escapes, no problem there.  All of Racoon City starts to get infected and all kinds of zombie hell is breaking out everywhere.  Alice our main character wakes up in a \"hospital\" after her ordeal from the first movie.  By the time she walks outside the city is already officially screwed.\n\nFirst the things I liked about the movie, I love the Resident theme, I like the action/fighting scenes, I generally like the characters and the acting, there aren't too many lame quotes, there are some decently frightening scenes and the special effects are about as good as you could ask for.\n\nNow what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.  Allrighty then, in all fairness the Umbrella Corporation knew the virus had infected the Hive, so prior to entering The Hive they could have and should have had safety measures ready to be deployed if the virus escaped into the city.  Okay I guess I can buy that.\n\nThere were naturally a couple of scenes that were lame or dumb, such as Alice jumping via motorcycle into the church where the other characters are battling against some Lurkers, not knowing where she was going to land and who she might squish on the other side.  A little bit reckless, but I'll forgive it as a theatrical flair.  And of course if a zombie/undead resurrecting virus gets lose one of the first things you would put on your site seeing list is a stroll through the cemetary, right?  Well our characters did, and of course the buried zombies don't crawl out of their graves until our characters are right dead smack in the middle of the cemetary.  Sigh... well every horror movie has to have the character stupidity moments and maybe the buried zombies didn't have enough willpower to dig themselves out until they started to smell fresh blood standing right on top of them.  All right I'll forgive that stuff.\n\nThen a semi-side plot to whole movie is the conflict between Alice and Nemesis (a huge T-virus mutant).  The Umbrella Corporation wants to see the two battle it out and test each other.  Allright so the two have a couple semi-random encounters which were actually kinda cool, but then we get towards the end of the movie and their \"battle\" has yet to resolve itself.  So we can't have that.  Rather than have to two stumble across/find each other in some random cool location and end it, an Umbrella Corporation scientist forces the two to literally fight now.  \"You and you step forward and end this.\"  I thought for a second I'd stumbled into a \"Mortal Kombat\" movie, I expected at anytime to hear the deep gravely voice utter the word FIGHT.  Needless to say the scene was lame.  Once again however ultimately forgivable due to artistic license.\n\nNow we come to the end.  A horrible disease ravaged a city the size of Chicago, a huge 30 ft wall is erected around the entire city (we are talking miles and miles of wall), newspapers lay scattered through the streets with headlines reading \"THE DEAD WALK\", people struggle to escape the city and many do before Umbrella Corporation puts a stop to it.  To cover this tragedy up Umbrella Corporation touches off a nuclear bomb and claims the power plant had a meltdown.  Fine no problem.\n\nHowever, some amateur footage of the zombie tragedy ends up in the hands of mainstream news.  Reports of disturbing and shocking footage are aired.  Oh, wait sorry, never mind the whole thing was just a hoax.  All we know is that Racoon City was leveled by a nuclear meltdown.  WHAT?  Are you trying to tell me no one in the outside public knew about this outbreak?  No one noticed the 30 ft wall surrounding a major metropolis?  Newspapers had enough time to release breaking news headlines reading \"THE DEAD WALK\" and nobody outside heard about it or read these articles?  None of the presumably thousands of earlier escapees told anyone about the tragedy?  None of the remaining people not to mention the reporting local news, government or law enforcement groups made a phone call to the outside world to report what was happening and/or ask for aid and/or say there goodbyes to loved ones, especially in the early hours of the outbreak?  How in the world am I supposed to buy that crap?\n\nIf you want a cover story say terrorists released a biological/viral disease and before anyone could figure out what was going on, the nuclear plant had a meltdown and obliterated the entire city and any potential explaination of the virus outbreak.  There both horrible tragedies reported and simply explained and resolved.  But no instead the outside world remains completely ignorant of the zombie disease outbreak. Please.  That my friends is why I didn't like this movie.  It makes the whole plot resolution unbelievable.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation \"on two's and three's\" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.\n\nWhen I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).\n\nSanta Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.\n\nIn this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.\n\nOkay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.\n\nNOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I know many people seem to love this WGBH, Masterpiece Theatre 1999 production of Charles Dickens' novel \"Great Expectations.\" However, I did not greatly enjoy this adaptation as many people have.\n\nMy reasons:\n\n- The picture quality is not much better than the 1981 version. Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)\n\n- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.\n\n- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.\n\n- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.\n\nOne positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.\n\nIn summary:\nI prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.\n\nFor people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I vividly remember seeing \"CE3K\" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote \"We are not alone!\". Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films. It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show. And, oh yes, that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie!\nI was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well. There is a highly noticable \"shimmering\" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents. Also, the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks.

{"text": "I am a big fan of Mr. Hanks and I am old enough to have watched and enjoyed many hours of \"The great one\" on television.  Both are very talented in their own ways.  I had not seen this film till today.  Not even sure why I suddenly wanted to watch it.  This is early in Hanks career and the semi-manic, rapid fire manner in which he juggles his way through a scene is already firmly in his grasp.  He is fun to watch.  The script is where I would prefer to focus my criticism because the actors were all quite fine.\n\nThere are other write-ups that will identify this as one of the best father - son relationship movies, ever.  I would hardly cast my vote that way.  For example, one of the most scorched earth movies that is everything that this film is not, \"Affliction\" with Nick Nolte and the late James Coburn is a smouldering, simmering volcanic dynamo.  \"Nothing in common\" by comparison is way too kosher, safe and aimed for middle America, taking very few risks and staying rather formulaic.  The comparison I draw might be unfair because there are many other father son movies and plays that far outshine this film.  For example \"Death of a salesman\", perhaps the greatest of them all, is an invitation to examine the dark side of family traffic.  Nothing in Common, watched now in 2014, seems by comparison to be a product of its time.  It suffers from not taking the emotional risks that real families in deep distress actually live through.\n\nGleason was robbed all his life of enough dramatic roles.  While a wonderful television icon he excelled in the very few really meaty dramatic roles and sadly we got to see too little of that.  In this film he is not given enough room to stretch his personality beyond the crabby old and sick man that he has become.  His character is not allowed to share the grief he continues to bottle up.  You spend a few minutes watching the interactions in \"Affliction\" and you can see what better scripts and raw gestalt can do for dramatic effect.\n\nI think that this film suffers from trying to be two things at once: a very light comedy and a light weight drama.  It would have been better served, in my view, by sticking with one version and strengthening the focus.  These were actors who could perform, all of them and its a shame that they were not allowed to show the pains of family stresses in a more forthright manner.\n\nI don't want to say that the film has aged badly.  It is a product of a Hollywood system that pushes product downstream into the market and cares much less about making bold statements.  By the reckoning of my own tastes, I enjoy a more visceral drama, one in which there is danger lurking beneath the rising blood pressure.  Will something suppressed, something urgent finally be said?  In fairness the strength of the film is in the last 20 minutes where the dramatic heat comes as close to a boil as the script allows.  I found myself sitting quietly and barely moved at all throughout the viewing.  It is a tepid affair and I would not recommend it too much, especially in light of what Tom Hanks went on to.  I needed to see something more substantial here;  perhaps I had nothing in common with the film?", "label": 2}

True, the plot is thin and the resolution thinner still...but the movie does have a story to tell and tries to do so.\nTo answer Mr. Thomas' question \"Why does the killer enter Mars' mind (presumably in the first place)?  It's simple really - her photos.  Early on we see examples of Mars' trendy, society-is-sick and dangerous fashion photographs.  The killer's childhood mirrors the crime scene photos (and Mars') that he has access to.  Connection made.\nWhy doesn't Laura warn her soon to be killed friends?  It's always too late.

{"text": "I have seen three films based on the life of Joan of Arc, the Ingrid Bergman film from the late 1940's, the video verison of the recent mini-series and this one, and this is, by far, the worst of the three.  Historically, it is a farce, (Joan did in fact have a sister named  Catherine, but she was not in any way harmed by the English, in fact,  Joan's village apparently only suffered one minor raid during the entire  war)...Bishop Cauchon, far from wanting to \"save Joan's soul\" was  the spearhead of the plot to completly discredit her and have her burned.  Neither did she sign with an \"X\"one of her letters to the English  garrisons around Orleans still survives in a museum and the  signature,Jeanne, which is what she called herself is plain...All period  sources agree on how even tempered she was, becoming upset only on very  rare occasions.  The Joan of this film seems closer to a lunatic than the  peasant girl who led an army. I will admit that the costuming is superb, as  good as any I have ever seen. Joan's spiritual side in this film is almost  non-existent, shown only by her requests to hear Mass during her  imprisonment.  As it stands, I only give this film two star based on the  cimenatography and the costuming...The great \"Joan of Arc\" film  is still to be made....", "label": 0}
{"text": "Just like volume 1, this is an excellent collection of Scripture songs with short explanations in between. Once you get past the late 80s/early 90s clothing and hair styles, the DVD is fun. I purchased this for my 3 year old as the whole family loves volume 1. Some observations:\n1. Compared to Volume 1, the verse selection is a little weak but still profitable. Volume 1 verses are readily applicable to a young child and understood. Volume 2 verses are best understood with a little more context, so perhaps a slightly older child who already knows some Bible.\n2. Vocal ranges: As a former music teacher, I tend to be very picky about vocal ranges for children. In general, D to D is best. This volume has multiple songs that go lower briefly. Still, it's not nearly as low as a lot of the children's music I hear coming out now.\n3. Pitch: Several of the songs feature children who aren't quite on pitch. In the video, you see the child in context and it's cute. But on the CD, it jarring to my ears. If it were just at the end of a song as a cute touch, it wouldn't be bad, but having an out-of-tune singer lead a song is just painful. Now, this probably would not drive the average non-musician crazy at all, so take this comment with a grain of salt.\n4. Song complexity: In volume 1, the song was first presented in its simplest form and then repeated with added complexity. In volume 2, the complexity is sometimes brought in at the beginning. This is just fine for a slightly older child.\n\nEven with these critiques, I am pleased with this CD/DVD. My daughter loves it, and I love that she's getting God's truth engrained into her heart. If I didn't have volume 1 to compare it with, I probably would have given it 5 stars.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This movie is EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. No, it's not a classic. No, it's not an academy award winner. But it does succeed where many others have failed.\nFirst, the good things:\n1) THE PACING, ACTION, AND SUSPSENSE are some of the best I've ever seen in a film. This film has a real sense of urgency and moves along at a breathtaking pace. It jumps from gloomy suspense to exciting action all within minutes. Both aspects are done very well; the movie will excite you with its visceral action scenes and scare you at the same time.\n2) THE ACTING is well done. While much of the characters aren't explained through dialogue, their body movements and subtle gestures to each other make you learn much about the characters. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, but it's good enough that it comes to the point where you care when some of the people die.\n3) THE MUSIC AND PRODUCTION DESIGN: The sets are wonderful and completely convey the high-tech, computerized feel that the movie is about. The music also flows with the production design and the acting, so everything feels in-sync. And by the way, the music greatly helps the picture, whether its the booming base during the battle scenes are the subtle high notes during the suspensful ones.\n4) THE PLOT IS GREAT. The director has the characters face so many enemies (alive, undead, machine, chemical, etc.) that the movie keeps surprising you and makes you keep guessing. It unfolds as a mystery and with the characters trying to pick up the pieces throughout.\nAnd the bad things...\n1) THE LENGTH was too short. At only 94 minutes (not including the credits), it didn't leave a lasting impression and I was forced to watch it again to get a better \"feel\" for it. There could've been much more character development and some of the sets created great places for some outstanding action scenes. Unfortunately, they are not to be seen.\n2) THE SPECIAL EFFECTS could've been better. Seeing the Licker push its way out of the metal cage always looks fake to me. But, they had a low budget so the Director did the best he could.\n3) THE ENDING, although good, should've been replaced with the alternate one. According to web interviews with director Paul W.S. Anderson and the commentary, there was a huge, action-packed ending with Milla Jovovich using the same gun that the \"One\" character had. A chance for more much-needed action. The ending presently in the movie is good and leaves room for a sequel, but I think there was enough scary stuff in the movie and it needed more action. Also, the \"climatic\" battle with the Licker on the train was sort of a disappoinment.\nAll in all, a solid video-game to movie adaption. It still has many problems, but you can do MUCH worse that sit through and enjoy this. Trust me.  3.5 stars.\n2002; 101 minutes; RATED R for strong violence/gore, some bad language, and brief sexuality/nudity.", "label": 2}

Her saintly aura shines out more in Leelee Sobieski. Her body type also more or less accurately depicts how the historical St. Joan may have looked like.\n\nMilla Jovovich, my Lady, continue on with your \"Resident Evil\" series and sexy \"Ultraviolet\" movie roles!

{"text": "First of all I'd like to put this review into perspective, I wanted so much to like this movie. I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?\nThis movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.\nThis movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.\nThe saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.", "label": 0}

{"text": "There are two ways to approach this film.  The first is whether it is a fair and accurate rendition of the events of the 1996 tragedy which was the subject of Krakauer's book.  The second is simply what entertainment value the film has.  Having read both Krakauer's book and Boukreev's \"The Climb,\" this film's flagrant deviation from any semblance of reality so distracted me that I was unable to discern any entertainment value in the film whatsoever.\n\nThings get started with a big fat lie.  We are informed at the very beginning that the film is based on published accounts and interviews of the participants.  This would lead the unsuspecting viewer to believe that the film makes an effort to be faithful to the truth.  I wonder how many people have watched this movie and think, as a result, that they know something about the tragedy, its causes, or even Everest and mountaineering for that matter.  They would be sadly mistaken on all accounts.\n\nThe film somberly announces each day of the expedition:  day one, day two, etc.  Each day finds the climbers of the two expeditions traveling as a group, reaching a new camp.  What a joke.  In reality, it takes weeks to establish the camps, while the climbers acclimatize to the altitude.  This is accomplished in small groups, not the entire expedition together.  If they had really climbed to camp IV in the four days depicted, they all would died of AMS before even being able to attempt the summit.\n\nHollywood being what it is, even a story about climbing Everest has to have some sex in it.  Sex American style, no less, meaning there can be no sex without moralizing.  We see Sandy Pittman's lover climb up to camp I to be with her, and a Sherpa voices strong disapproval because they're not married.  He foretells that the mountain will not tolerate such flaunting of its moral code, and he fears the worse.  This entire segment is a product of the screenwriter's imagination.  But now we know that the entire tragedy was the result of Ms. Pittman's unrestrained libido.\n\nWe don't have to wait for the tragedy proper to get a taste of the mountain's ability to have revenge.  In the next scene, a Taiwanese climber (although, there were no Taiwanese in the two groups, the screenwriter created these characters to play the role of buffoonish amateurs) walks out of his tent in his boot liners, slips on the ice and falls to his death.\n\nI'm not going to catalog all the factual errors in the film here.  By this time you get the idea.  What happened is less important than what the screenwriter thinks would make good drama (and it's amazing how bad his idea of good drama is).\n\nThe most outrageous deviation from the truth comes during the unfolding of the tragedy itself.  As the situation deteriorates, the movie has Krakauer coordinating and leading rescue efforts, including going back onto the mountain in an effort to find Rob Hall.  In truth, Krakauer spent the night sleeping in his tent, too exhausted to move.  The only member of the two teams who made any rescue efforts at all after returning to Camp IV was Boukreev, who single handedly saved the lives of four climbers lost on the South Col.\n\nOther reviewers have commented on other failings of the movie, and to those I will only add that it is extremely difficult to follow the movie at times, because it's hard to know who is who.  Characters are not introduced and most of them do not get enough camera face time to be recognized, especially all wrapped up in a snowsuit with fake snow and ice hanging off their faces.", "label": 0}

Soldiers arrive for the blacksmith, they found the escaped convict and put him in irons. Joe never learned to read. [No schools for common people then.] Pip is cleaned up for a visit. He plays cards with a young girl (pretty and proud). [Does their behavior seem odd?] Pip is questioned about his visit. \"Can this be true?\" He returns in six days for another visit. He sees strange things in that house. When he returns he is given a large sum of money. Afterwards he gets into a fight. [What a strange household!] Pip dreams of a better life. There is conflict in the shop. Later Pip finds a body! Who did it?\n\nLater Lawyer Jaggers tells Pip he has a fortune and will be brought up as a gentleman \"with great expectations\". It's a secret benefactor. Can Joe be compensated for the loss of Pip? Pip gets a new suit and goes to London. They show scenes of life in those days. [To shock the viewer?] Pip's education begins. He lodges at Bernard's Inn. He visits a coworker. He visits Jagger's home and is given a letter. He learns of the death of his sister. Pip visits Miss Haversham again. Pip meets a young lady, they go to a recital. There is a dinner, a toast creates conflict. Pip is jealous of Estella's beau. Pip is in debt, he gets 500 as a birthday present! A strange man meets Pip to tell him a secret. What will Pip do now? Pip visits Miss Haversham, there is a conversation and conflict. Then he visits Joe Gadgery. Miss Betty taught Joe to read. \"Never leave documentary evidence laying around.\" Pip advises Abel to leave. Drummel married Estella. Jagger's housekeeper Molly has a past.\n\nPip returns to question Miss Haversham about Estella. He reproaches her for her past actions. There is a fire! Pip finds Auric and there is conflict. Pip tells his secret! [Who is worse off?] pip goes to the funeral. Abel talks about his lost daughter, given up for adoption. A side-wheel steamer is on the river. Another boat draws near. There is an accusation and a struggle! Two men fall into the water. Pip dives in to save a man. Abel is taken to court for trial. Pip and Wimmick visit a church. Later visits Abel on his deathbed to say goodbye. Abel's daughter is a lady now, but he never met her. Pip arrested for unpaid debts. Joe pays off the debts. Pip talks to Betty and learns surprising news. Pip returns to Miss Haversham's mansion and finds Estella living there. Is she unhappy? What will Pip do now?\n\nI never read the book so I can't say how faithful this adaption was. The beginning dragged for nearly an hour. Maybe another writer or director would have done better? There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times. There once was a book that told about the History of the Great American Fortunes. There may be comparable books today, if they could be published.", "label": 0}

I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.\n\nThe plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.\n\nI wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored.

{"text": "*** SPOILER in the 2nd paragraph ***\n\nI'll be honest: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this save-the-president film; though I like Harrison Ford well enough, I won't say I'm exactly a fan, and the plot seemed really hackneyed.  Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.\n\nLike a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.\n\nStill, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.\n\nA time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I was nonplussed at first, of seeing yet another video game hit the cinemas. But I went anyway, when I saw one of the tv trailers, and found out Milla Jovovich playes our heroine Alice, and the film is directed by Paul Anderson, whose Mortal Kombat was surprisingly pleasant popcorn fare.\nWhile the story is based on the game, the plot is really a prequel to the Nemesis story that is alluded to in the movie's final scenes.\nIn an opening sequence we are introduced to The Hive, an underground research facility where the clandestine arm of the medical mogul Umbrella Corporation practices it's illegal genetic experimentation-until a terrible virus is released into the air system.\nOur main character Alice then wakes up in a shower stall, with no memory of why. She can't remember who or where she is either, so I was a bit confused until later in the story. Alice is then burst in upon by a team of SWAT types demanding her report. Then off we go through the Looking Glass House with Alice and the S.T.A.R.S. to find the Red Queen-a supercomputer who has locked down The Hive with all its occupants.\nOur team must shut down the Red Queen, and escape from the Hive before it is sealed off from the outside forever. It is a simple plan, until we learn what Umbrella Corp.'s virus has made of the men and women who worked there.\nOnce the computer is shut down, the film becomes a full-fledged flesh-eating nightmare as our heroes try to escape. Alice reveals a side of herself she didn't know was there, which allows them to make progress and also realizes that one of their band doesn't really want to help them.\nMilla Jovovich does very well in this action film. As Alice learns more about herself, she becomes a much more interesting figure that Jovovich manages to inject with some humanity. She also fights very convincingly.\nMichelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius and James Purefoy all have meaningful roles and play them well, as do the other cast members.\nPaul Anderson has made his best film yet, but has sacrificed much of the humanistic elements for action and gore. Still, they do survive. Technically, the film looks wonderful. The editing is dramatic, even though it really overuses the \"shock-you\" moments where things jump into frame and surprise you. The tension is real, and I jumped in my seat and chomped on my nails a few times. The Looking Glass House looks much like the game and the Hive sets are very claustrophobic as in Aliens. In fact, one scene is ripped right out of Aliens!\nPaul W. S. Anderson still pushes the envelope when it comes to shock, gore and overall gruesomeness though. There were moments when I could not watch.\nI did like it though. It does not aspire to do anything more than scare you and gross you out, but it is very effective. Not bad for what Michelle Rodriguez terms \"MTV, ADD\" filmaking.", "label": 2}

Jodi Foster is often lauded for her role in \"Taxi Driver\"  but I don't see why. It was small and one dimensional and (I feel) not  particularly well acted. And Cybil Shepard? Give me a break! Lousy acting  can never be covered up with a soft focus lens. I did like Albert Brooks,  however.\nAnd the ending? What is that all about? It makes no sense, has  no logic and is not even profound (which it must be if logic is thrown out  the window). Just when this movie should've been over there is another 15  minutes tacked on that should've been left on the cutting room floor. It is  almost as if the studio exec's said, \"Hey, uh, Marty? That ending is  too gruesome and unresolved. How about tidying it up nice and neat for us,  eh?\"\nI like many of Scorsese's movies (especially \"Good  Fellas\"), and of course I always enjoy De Niro's acting, but I found  no redeeming value in \"Taxi Driver\".

I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film. As stated by film critics one of the main selling points was a chance for Uma Thurman to have her own fashion show(which in itself is not a bad thing).Others critcize it for being so campish and the constant silly banter going on between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. However, give it some credit for trying to stick to the formula that won the original tv series its loyal following. Anyone that follows those episodes will probably agree that this movie more or less stayed along those lines.

{"text": "Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc is at times brilliant and at other times chaotic. In a few scenes it is brilliant and chaotic at the same time. How can this be, you ask? It's because it was made by the brilliant but messy French director, Luc Besson. Besson did two of my favorite pop culture movies, La femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. I admired both of these for the same reasons. Both are high-tech, fast-paced visualizations of absurd stories. They are triumphs of style over substance. Nikita is about a young female criminal who is coerced by the French equivalent of the CIA into becoming an assassin. The Fifth Element is a bizarre science fiction story set in the future. In it, Bruce Willis, aided by a truly weird alien girl, must keep the evilest force in the universe from destroying the human race. I think the reason that Messenger is a weaker film is that Besson's unique style does not work well when he deals with a story set six hundred years in the past.\nYou would think that this filming of the Joan of Arc story would be great because this is a French film with several American stars in the cast. [Don't panic! It's in English.] But, beyond Besson's limitations are the limitations of the story itself, which is shrouded in mystery. In the early 15th Century, a young French peasant girl named Joan had visions that she claimed told her she was to lead an Army that would free her people from English rule. The army was raised by the dauphin, the English retreated, and the dauphin became Charles VII, King of France. Afterwards, Joan's reward was to be tried as a heretic and then burned at the stake. This much seems to be accepted by historians. Whether or not Joan actually lead the army is hotly debated. Who actually tried Joan is also not known for sure. Some think it was the English, others think it was the Catholic church. We do not even know the exact nature of the charges against her. We cannot say for sure what events caused the poor girl to go from heroine to martyr. She was basically forgotten about until the 19th Century, when her story was used as a political tool to advance the cause of French nationalism. Five hundred years after her death, the Church declared her to be a Saint.\nI tell you all this history because it is my opinion that a satisfactory movie about her will never be made, because it is impossible to tell the story in a way that will please everyone. That leaves us to deal with the successes and failures of The Messenger on a purely cinematic basis. Its strong points include its visual richness. The feel of the period is lovingly rendered. The script adroitly sidesteps the issue of Joan's visions. While it does not deny that her messages may have come from God, it also suggests the possibility that she was simply delusional. It concludes that, whatever the source of her messages, the savageness of her trial made even her doubt her sources.\nOne of the movie's weaknesses lays in casting Milla Jovovich as Joan. I have admired her work in other films, but, like the director, she is not the right choice for a historical epic. The biggest mistake, however, was made in choosing to show in detail several gruesome battles. These occupy perhaps a third of the movie's two and one half hours running time. They become redundant and detract from the more interesting story of Joan - her childhood, her visions, her dealing with royal powers, her interactions with the all-male troops, and her eventual and tragic fall from grace. The result is that Messenger is an interesting movie, but hardly a great one.", "label": 2}

The Dalton/Clark version is by far the \"best\" and most thorough version and though Dalton, IMO, is too handsome to play Rochester,  Dalton's performance is outstanding, as is Clarke's as Jane.  Hinds and  Morton are my second favorites.  This version is missing vital pieces of  the story, but the performances of Morton and Hinds are quite acceptable  and good.  I like the comic aspect they added (the scene where Jane returns  from visiting w/her dying aunt) and Rochester is seated on the wall outside  Thornfield and he complains to her about her not having written to him.  Hinds melted my heart in this scene and I have been a fan ever since.  Morton is good as Jane and delivered her lines perfectly.

{"text": "Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.\n\nArnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.\n\nAlso, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.\n\nIn a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.", "label": 2}

It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.\n\n3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.\n\nThe plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words.

{"text": "I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.\n\nSamantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge/dp/B0000AQS3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Mayor of Casterbridge</a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Persuasion</a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.\n\nIf you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama. The wonderful Gemma Jones from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001ADXWYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sense-And-Sensibility/dp/B0019TYQ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sense And Sensibility</a>&nbsp;as Mrs. Fairfax, Elizabeth Garvie from 1980's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Complete-BBC-Miniseries-VHS/dp/B00004WG2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pride and Prejudice: The Complete BBC Miniseries [VHS</a>] as Diana Rivers, and Rupert Penry-Jones of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/White-Chapel-The-Ripper-Returns/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">White Chapel: The Ripper Returns</a>as St. John Rivers.\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Given that I am quite easy on love stories, crazy about the Italian culture, and think highly of both Marisa T. and Robert D. as actors, this should have been an easy ride for me.  It certainly began with a premise I hold dear - - the notion that there is such a thing as \"the one\" and how we must overcome the forces that tell us to settle.  And so when Tomei's character is initially duped by Downey's character into believing he is the \"damon bradley\" she is seeking, I forgave his lie as an act of desperation by someone who has fallen hard in a split second.  However, for him to then subsequently set up a whole false scenario where he hires a friend to pretend to be the real \"damon bradley\" so he can appear generous and selfless in Tomei's eyes, was nothing short of cruel.  No one with a kind heart would do that to someone they truly love.  And I could never root for someone who had something like this in them. A romantic movie only works if you like both people and their flaws are forgivable -- as opposed to indicative of a willingness to manipulate, repeatedly lie, and consciously hurt someone to win them over to your side (this is especially true if the romantic movie is trying to sell itself as more drama and substance than just hapless comedy).\n\nPS I gave an extra star for the Italian scenery and beautiful hotels chosen for the film.", "label": 2}

{"text": "\"Take the Money and Run\" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity.\nThis is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.\nThe mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films \"Bananas\" and \"Sleeper\". Not till \"Love and Death\" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.\nWhile most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying \"Get to the point\" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.\nThis film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on \"Take the Money and Run\", you won't be missing too much.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I hated this version of Jane Eyre - it's just wrong in so many ways.  First, while I would agree that most of the actors are well cast, and Samantha Morton is a very apt Jane Eyre, I was incredibly disappointed in Ciaran Hinds.  He is horribly, horribly miscast and, as a result, I have no idea what Jane finds to love in his angry, ranting, flat, and one-dimensional characterization of Rochester.  There's no brooding sadness, no playful charm; he's just abusive and selfish and mean the whole film.\n\nAlso, the adaptation is severely lacking in purpose and sacrifices the important themes and relationships that Bronte crafted so well in an attempt to cater to our short attention spans and our desire for cookie cutter romance.  Moments are changed or left out completely, for no apparent reason, creating situations that make no sense (i.e. why does she go home to see Mrs. Reed before she dies? We never find out.) Some scenes are just creepy - like when Mr. Rochester is lustfully stroking her hand after she puts out the fire in his room - very disturbing.  And the dialog has been changed and modernized making the whole thing seem like a bad soap opera.  Please don't insult my intelligence!!!\n\nBut the worst aspect of this version is that Jane is not allowed to grow and change and become the independent woman that she needs to be before she can be equal to Rochester and come back to him on her own terms - which is the whole point of the book!  I was actually offended by the ending of the film and felt that throughout Jane is dumbed down and made into a weak, lovesick girl.\n\nThe 2006 Masterpiece Theater version is without a doubt the best, followed closely by the Timothy Dalton version.

{"text": "Remember all those really campy films from the 1950s such as The Crawling Hand?  Idle Hands is basically the same type of movie, only much sillier, much campier, and in some respects embarrassingly bad.  The filmmakers really don't even bother to explain the whole silly concept; a corporeal, murderous hand on the rampage normally doesn't need a lot of background info, but in this case Anton (Devon Sawa) simply has his own hand somehow possessed without the rogue hand causing all the mischief even finding him.  Only after Anton cuts his hand off, do we return to the more traditional animated, murderous hand on the rampage theme, and that works much better than Anton's constant battle to control what his right hand is doing as long as it is attached to his arm.  As far as the rest of the explanation goes, we have a Druidic priestess (Vivica A. Fox) trying to find and destroy the hand before midnight Druid time, at which time the hand will take a soul into the netherworlds.  In my opinion, this story doesn't even begin to work.\nA little bit of comedy is supplied by the always-funny Seth Greene (who plays Mick) and his buddy Pnub (Elden Henson).  These two, along with Anton, are the triumvirate of lazy, pot-smoking teens (just the type of victim said hand likes to prey upon).  Probably the funniest part of the film involves the reappearance of an undead Pnub and Mick (who carries his severed head around with him most of the time); the staircase to heaven, they said, was just too far to walk, so they decided to just stay on earth.  The only bright spot in this film, and the only reason I wanted to see it, is Jessica Alba.  I was somewhat amazed to see some of the facial expressions and attitudes she would later display in her role in the incredibly good TV series Dark Angel.\nIdle Hands is just too stupid to be at all horror-inspiring, and it is too stupid to even be funny for the most part.  I usually love these types of campy films, but in this case I would have to say that the fellow with the most idle hands of all was the scriptwriter, as he really didn't give us much of a story for this film.", "label": 0}

He'd never be able to walk again.\n\nI find it utterly contemptible that the film-makers rounded up a cast of ARMENIANS and GREEKS to play Turks as being a bunch of hideously sadistic goons.  Were they really that ignorant of history?  Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.  There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.\n\nOliver Stone apologized to the Turkish people when he finally visited Turkey, and he was kindly forgiven -- but I sure wouldn't have let him off so easily.  His self-serving \"apology\" was far too little, and far too late.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......\n\nOn the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.\n\nIn its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.\n\nThe basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.\n\nAfter the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.\n\nA perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.\n\nThere's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.\n\nI read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.\n\nThe acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.\n\nThe film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.\n\nSpecial effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).\n\nI'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.\n\n(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)\n\nThe Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The initial idea is not bad but the story fails to really engage because the main character is not a moral man. He is basically a jerk who only cares about taking REVENGE for his murdered partner. It's NOT about saving a woman from slavery or protecting society from a dangerous murderer/criminal. And the attraction towards him by Kim Basinger's character is just sad - he slaps her, says nasty rude things that only an abused woman like her would be willing to overlook. Hence I don't want to root for him to get her, he does not deserve it in the slightest. As for the action part of the movie, it's OK but not great. Early on I had to cringe at a glaring faux pas of the film makers - he puts hand-cuffs on his LEFT hand and her RIGHT hand but when they get into a car she is sitting on his right side and yet he is able to drive completely unencumbered! Come on - could've made some effort to make it more realistic! Bottom line - action is ok, acting is not bad (Jeroen Krabbe is great as a villain) but the story itself does not fully engage and falls flat at the end. It's important to have a hero at the core of such a genre - think Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. The main reason we love these characters and are willing to forgive their unconventional methods is because they fight the GOOD fight and check their egos at the door.

Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a \"Heather\" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....\n\nI LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.

As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.\nSome continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)\nExtras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).\nThe soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.\nCatholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a \"personal relationship with God\" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.

And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals\nhimself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so\nrefreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status\nthat resulted from his brothers' betrayal.

{"text": "I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.\nIn my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.

{"text": "Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.\n\nAlas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.\n\nBut what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a \"What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?\" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out \"That's right leave, its just like you.\" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed \"kissing\" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)\n\nBut there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch.

I happen to fall into the latter category, and  although I do believe there are good movies aimed at that particular  audience (teens) I don't feel this is it..  The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes).\nAll in all, a bad movie that is aimed at  the teen-age genre with pointless drugs and a bad script.

In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed.

Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers.

After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.", "label": 1}

And the movie has much fun with  that, and I'm sure Devon Sawa had a lot of fun with his hand. But the movie  is really unimpressive. You have to wonder how much pot the *writer* was  actually on, because that's pretty much what the movie revolves around:  smoking lots of pot.\nAs in most movies, the requisite girl (played here  by Jessica Alba) has nothing better to do but to be a sexual object, and be  in danger. She is apparently a \"songwriter/musician\" but that's  just thrown in there for the hell of it and has no purpose whatsoever. In  fact, none of the female characters here are at all developed. The  \"evil-fighter\" just randomly appears. The other girl has no point  but to die. The movie is mindlessly gory.\nI award the movie two stars for  having a message against laziness (which is overtly stated by Sawa), having  Seth Green, and being fun at some points.", "label": 0}

Excellent war scenes with medieval war devices seldom seen in any other movie. A number of the aspects of warfare and armaments in The\nMessenger were portrayed quite accurately and a few military historians, including Kelly DeVries, have commented on such. It had great visuals, in my opinion very good acting on everyone's part. Milla Jovovich's acting was superb in my opinion, and why the knee jerk negativity from people parroting everyone else saying \"she's a model, she can't act\" is just too lemming like to avoid being sadly humorous. I've watched it three times over the last few years and I own the DVD. Very good cast. The general and his troops were excellent. It's so typical of French history, too, lose most of your battles, finally find someone who leads you to victory, and then betray her and let your enemy burn her at the stake. I think at least a few of the negative reviews are from French apologists.", "label": 2}

Since it is almost word for word from the Bible, except for a few conversational interactions, such as greetings, etc., you can be sure it is true to God's word.  One thing I love about it is that it shows Him as a strong man (He WAS a carpenter, after all.) rather than a milk toast as He is usually depicted.  The only thing I did not like was that since they wanted to stay true to the book of John, they didn't put a crown of thorns on his head, because although Matthew, Mark, and Luke all do describe the crown, John does not.  Yet, you can't fault their resolve to be absolutely true to that account.

It was supposedly cutting edge and \"gritty\" with a \"based on a true story\" aspect to it.  However- the major emotion upon seeing this film in its entirety a second time years later- was one of embarrassment.\n\nThe main character, Billy Hayes, along with the rest of the Westerners come off as nauseating egotists that I found myself having a hard time feeling much sympathy for.  The court room speech Billy Hayes delivers at his sentencing is so over the top that it is laughable.  And a later scene when his girl friend comes to visit is moronically uncomfortable to watch. And the film is quite dated.  Frankly- compared to just about any US prison- the Turkish prison presented in that film looks downright comfy and cozy with an anarchic freedom on the inside that one would never see in just about any antiseptic rigidly controlled US slam.\n\nThat being said the film is shot well and the story is capably told.  It just doesn't stand up to the test of time very well.  I'd recommend it to someone who hadn't seen it- but with heavy caveats.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The first 30 or so minutes of \"Resident Evil\" is everything you could really hope for in a horror movie: a clever, tightly-plotted, interesting story that keeps you on your toes and makes you wince a little -- in a delightful \"Oh man, I can't believe they went THERE\" sort of way -- every few minutes. The movie starts out fast and never really lets you get your footing, while it delivers punch after punch in a very effective progression. If only they could have kept it up the whole way through.\n\nHowever, once the walking dead come out, everything goes downhill fast. And I don't mean in a good way.\n\nThe funny thing is, it shouldn't be like this. The majority of the concept of the video games that spawned the film \"Resident Evil\" is fighting zombies, and the games are fun to play. One would think that the film would manage to re-create this effect easily. It's the opposite that's true, however, as everything leading up to the appearance of the zombies is the best part of the film. Once the re-animated corpses actually start lurching out onto the main stage, it just gets sort of boring.\n\nMind you, \"Resident Evil\" did benefit from some rather good stuff. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez both add something unique to their roles. Butt-kicking women are something of a staple in video games and in action films these days, but these two make their characters into more than the stereotype, and they're fun to watch. Milla, in particular, has a truly unique quality about her which she brings to everything she plays, and its on display here too. The music played throughout the film sets the tone nicely. The little hints dropped throughout the movie for devotees of the game series (listen, for example, for a mention of \"Project Nemesis\") add a bit of fun to it.\n\nBut in the end, this could have been better any way you slice it. As a horror movie, it's not very scary. As an action movie, it's not that exciting. Judged against other, similar films (\"28 Days Later\" for example), it comes in a bit lacking. Even when compared to its source, the video game by the same name, it doesn't quite measure up.\n\nThere are those who would say that movies based on video games are destined to failure, but I disagree. \"Resident Evil\" has the potential to make for a great film, even a great series of films. If you only look at the first 30 or so minutes of this movie, you can see where that potential lies. The fact that you can stop the movie once the first zombies stumble out of the shadows and not miss much of anything tells you where that potential fell short.", "label": 2}

Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.\n\nRE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.\n\nI found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.\n\nIn short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year.

Yes you must take your shoes off when you enter, even if it is your house. Strange things begin to happen to this family. The mother begins to stare at the wall. Her son is worried and his wife is nervous about living in Japan. The movie moves back and forth between several stories, one of which is this one about the family. The other is about Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, a student who is assigned to visit the seemingly senile mother in this freaky house. I love how Gellar walks toward the house so slowly and looks back and forth like a manic squirrel. She's never been there before. What's there to be afraid of yet?

It's convoluted, but it's not too hard to follow.\n\nIt kinda reminded me of The Ring, just the way it looks and how the tone is. I like The Ring better, though. This movie did scare me.

{"text": "First, let me say this with confidence: \"Resident Evil\" starts with nastiness, and then goes to downright nastiness till the end.  I like Milla Jovovich, so as far as she is on the screen, it's OK.  But the film itself is ... awful.  Not that it fails to entertain us.  It is often scary (some of the kids were jumping in the seat, it's true).  Its production designs are decent.  However, the director Paul W.S. Anderson doens't know one thing: originality.\nThe story is about Alice and the squad with special mission, who have to (they are told) to shut down the main computer of The Hive, underground institute specializing in the study of lethgal virus.  An accident there changes the workers (and dogs too) into zombies, and in this deadly place with booby traps, Alice in undergraund has to fight with a vengeance.\nOK. ...are  As it is, fondly remembering James Cameron and David Twohy, I started to get bored after a while, the film being completely relying on shock tactics of sudden big \"Bang!\" and strongly suggested violence.\nJovovich (a bit one-note) is so-so, though lacking the presense of Jolie; Michelle Rodriguez is good, but I frankly thought they are wasting the time and the career.  All in all, just a passable flick though I strongly recommend that you  watch \"Aliens\" instead.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Everybody has something that they enjoy and just can't explain.  They might even be a little embarassed to admit that they like it.  Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In \"Spice World,\" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.\nFunny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls \"interact\" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the \"telly\" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip.\nAlan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well.\nThe only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie.\nOverall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.", "label": 2}

Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, \"Steel Magnolias\" concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, \"Fried Green Tomatoes\".\nColumbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.  Although we learn why the film was written, there are virtually NO INTERVIEWS with principle cast members and very little in the way of background on how the film was made.

Sexual assault is one of the most under reported crimes: at least 54% of rapes are never reported; 3% of cases see any type of conviction (DOJ, 2006) -> so films like these that make it seem okay to sexually assault somone aids in the rape culture that preaches acceptance and makes women (especially women) less likely to report sexual assault.\n\nI mean why would you report to the police something you just saw Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah acting out on the big screen (or your flat screen since its miles old now).

I watched this with my male friend and at the end we both turned to each other and said, \"Never go to Turkey.\"  Others have said, \"Never smuggle drugs in Turkey.\"  The movie failed to make a legitimate point, or explore a theme.  It exploited drugs, violence, and sex.  It simple took pleasure in machismo -- whether hetero or homo machismo.  IT FAILED TO EXPLORE THE TRULY HUMAN.\n\nI had hope when I saw the father come to visit the son -- as in the movie \"In the Name of the Father\" a 5 star movie about prison, cross-cultural (Irish-English) life.  But when I saw the father shout threats at the prison warden for no other reasons than sheer anger-indulgence, I realized this movie was probably bankrupt.  The movie reflects immaturity and failure to develop a controlling vision.  There were SO many wonderful ways this material could have gone.  The creative potential was enormous.  The 70's macho culture could only see this?  Slaves to their narrow world view.\n\nThe only thing good:  the cinematography, and evocative music and some of the nonviolent prison scenarios.  I was reminded of Dante's circles of hell.  Then a little research was in order.  I was thinking of Turkey's struggles between secular democracy (Ataturk's reforms) and its Medieval past.  There were clearly two power structures and judges (the secular and the religious?) struggling for dominance.  I was thinking of the issue of individual justice and the needs of society to make an example of Billy etc etc etc...But director and producers did nothing to develop any ideas.  I have so many ideas about how this material could have been developed....  it is frustrating to see that too often this type of junk wins out.\n\nI don't trust Oliver Stones movies about \"real life.\"  That is a joke.  Real life is more interesting and rich and meaningful than what he \"created\" -- here at least.\n\nGo to YouTube and get the backstory on this movie. That is far more interesting.  Billy is kind of despicable, but if they had honestly told his story, perhaps tweaking it here and there...the movie would have been much better.  Billy claims the experience was the best thing that happened to him!!  Why didn't they run with that?

{"text": "THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snow-cat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad village named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the \"Burgermeister Meisterberger\", toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toy making. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. When the boy grows up he is given he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to sneak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it received huge ratings. It still airs every year.\n\nThis special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailman's voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Children's Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.\n\nThere are several releases on VHS, laser-disc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly recommend.", "label": 1}

The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.\n\nThere's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.\n\nThere's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.\n\nPotiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis.

{"text": "It is beyond me how anyone can say this is the best version of Bronte's novel.  Beyond the highly truncated screenplay which makes little attempt to be faithful to the novel, both Morton and Hinds are horribly miscast.  I love both these actors and was initially excited to see them in these roles -- until I sat down to watch it.  Hinds made a wonderful Capt. Wentworth (and many other roles) but as Rochester all he does is shout and bellow his way thru the story.  His Rochester is entirely one-note, a very shallow performance on his part -- there's no dimension, no spark, no inner life.  He seems to have viewed the role as just a cliched cartoonish gothic hero - he doesn't approach the character with any seriousness.  Morton is equally shallow in the role - neither actor seems to have taken their characters seriously.  There are good production values and Morton and Hinds are good enuf that some good moments come thru.  This certainly is superior to the William Hurt/Zeffereli version, but then that's not too difficult.  Even the recent flawed Toby Stephens version is superior to this one as well.

{"text": "I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.\n\nInstead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials.", "label": 0}

The child does not reappear, and the way the family deal with it  is extremely well done.  Pfeiffer portrays the mother who never gets over  the grief extremely well.  The second half of the movie deals with the  family moving to Chicago, and by an amazing twist of fate, stumble across  their son. Naturally it is NOT all roses from here on.  The son is taken  out of the home he is used to, told that he was kidnapped and expected to  fit in to his new family. By this time, I was very sad as I just wanted it  to come together nicely for the family. For awhile the movie seeed to drag,  but it was still watchable.  Fine performances from Treat Williams as the  father who expects everything to fall into place, and as mentioned above, a  great performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who has to endure so  much pain.

The problem was there were none, and not only was there nothing different the movie never even pretended to try.

{"text": "\"Jesus, His Life, Mystery and Message\" is a marvelous film on the life and times of Jesus, and though in its 10 chapters it skips around a bit, and there is an occasional slip in the script, those familiar with Scripture will appreciate this ambitious project, and the content that is biblically based, as well as the visual presentation. An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.\n\nIt delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity. I give it 5 stars for making the most of a low budget production. Total running time is 160 minutes.", "label": 1}

The musical is modified in several ways. Of the original 14 Rodgers and Hart songs, 8 remained with the movie. Sinatra sings classics such as; \"I Didn't Know What Time It was\" and \"I Could Write a Book,\" and \"The Lady Is a Tramp;\" and \"My Funny Valentine\" by Linda English is perhaps the best parts of the movie.\n\nThe story is about a singer named Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra), known for his womanizing ways is an out of work singer looking for a job in San Francisco. He meets a chorus girl named Linda English (Kim Novak), slowly, but steadily their friendship blossoms into love and romance. In the meantime, he develops a relationship with a wealthy widow named Vera Simpson (Rita Hayworth) to seek her help to finance his dream, \"Chez Joey\", a night club of his own. When the new night club is about to open, Vera finds about Joey and Linda, and she asks Joey to fire Linda, and he refuses, and Vera withdraws support for the night club. Joey and Vera use each other to the bitter end, ultimately Vera gives in, and Joey wins not only the club but also his prize, Linda.

But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision.\nAnd yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're \"sensitive\" and intelligent, we're supposed to go \"awwww\" and think how wonderful they are.\nThe acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.  Other than Ms. Garr, the rest of the cast is either way over-the-top (Dreyfuss) or forgettable.\nClose Encounters is long, pretentious, sometimes dull, but often visually interesting to look at.

But this movie is not neccessarily meant for adults. I mean, the special effects for one thing were not spectacular. Like The Ring, the effects were indeed creepy but not great. The plot is all right but at the end it gets shady, and the ending itself was kind of a cliff- hanger and I'm one of those viewers whom don't like cliff- hanger endings that much. If you start a story, you should end it as well in my opinion. Overall it is meant to be a teen thriller, one that does not have great talent and special effects but of average quality like they use in teen filcks. And there were one or two other questions they wouldn't answer exactly. It wasn't exactly a mature film. But nonetheless I would recommend it for a night when you just want to relax and get creeped out, because indeed you will. So I give it three stars as a fun horror movie, not great, but not at all horrible either.\n\nI don't want to give anything away so I will merely say that The Grudge is about Karen, an exchange student (Gellar) whom is working in Tokyo, Japan as a house nurse to a sick old woman, and soon she figures out there is something wrong with the house.

The music is beautifully arranged and doesn't sound like a low budget synthesizer.  This is actually well orchestrated and professionally recorded.  The lyrics are straight out of the Bible, and a terrific way to memorize scripture!  Our son has thoroughly enjoyed the music, and begs for us to play it for him over and over.  We have listened to the CD so many times I'm amazed it hasn't gotten worn out, and even more amazingly my husband and I are not sick of it...on the contrary, we are sincerely uplifted by it.  It hasn't gotten on our nerves, the way so many other kid's CD's do.  The DVD is definitely outdated, as far as the outfits go, but the content and the music are delightful!

Their reply is for the French to quote\"Go F**K Yourselves!\",Shortly after the siege takes place,there is an endless round of \"F\" words. I'm sorry. I'm no scholar,but I don't think that,in 1420,that F word was even invented much less used in such a casual manner..

Now more than thirty years later, it doesn't resonate as well. More recent productions of the same storyline are more emotional, awestruck and have better photography and musical scores, but this version of Jesus is a pure bread and butter version especially suited for those not yet familiar with the teachings of Jesus and need an initiation presented in a plain and simple way. A few years ago, this same evangelical production company created a wrap-around version of the film centered on the conversion of Mary Magdaline which, oddly enough, seemed more affecting than the original.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I guess like most people who bought/rented this dvd, I am a huge fan of medieval flicks. Granted, most films set in this period are bereft of historical accuracy; Braveheart and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves being two obvious examples. But if the film is a genuine masterpiece then such concerns are - within reason - mere side-issues.\nBut this effort from luc besson is no masterpiece - not by any manner of means. The rot stems from Milla Jovovich's catastrophic portrayal of Joan of Arc. If I was French I'd be mortified at the  thought of seeing that nation's most revered heroine depicted as a screaching harpie. The character of Joan comes across as downright irritating and, quite frankly, ridiculous.\nWhat vestige of credibility may have remained was scattered to the four winds in the scene when the English Army refused to fight the French with Joan as their general. After all, this is the same band of soldiers that brutally killed and raped a member of Joan's family only a few years before (apparently): is it really believable that the rantings of such a derranged brat could inspire so much confidence in her men  - and fear in the English - that she could lead the French to victory? Of course, this did actually happen, but in the context of this film its absurd.\n..., you actually find yourself rooting for the English - hoping they put you out of your misery by burning the witch at the stake post-haste. This really shouldn't be the case, but it is.\nFrancophiles and lovers of the Joan d'Arc legend beware: This is  three hours of torturous tosh.

Is like the same angel or saint in three different ages. The movie has more o less a slow pace and it turns really boring after 3/4 parts of the movie had elapsed. I think the version of Joan of Arc, starred by Lelee Sobieski is more loyal to what really happened than this one.

{"text": "There is only one brief moment in Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided film of Resident Evil in which he actually captures the awesomely creepy atmosphere of the original games. It's when we first meet Milla Jovovich's character, dazed and amnesiac, waking up in the shower in a dark and deserted mansion. It's also the only scene that can reasonably be termed \"horror.\" For most of the rest of the film, Anderson tries to capture a riff similar to that of James Cameron's Aliens...and fails. Sure, there are specific elements of the game introduced here and there (like the skinned-looking zombie dogs), but what on earth kind of zombie movie is it that has NO GORE!? Perhaps fearing those prudes at the MPAA, Anderson gives us close-ups of muzzle flashes in the gun-battle scenes when any REAL zombie movie would be bestowing its special make-up effects crew with the latest means of molding exploding heads. Make no mistake, this is an action movie, not a horror movie, and not a particularly tense or original one, borrowing as it does from every \"bunch of folks getting picked off one by one\" plot that's come down the pike. (For a movie that's almost identical to this one but actually remembers to be good cheesy fun, try John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars.) There is, now that I remember it, one other shot that reminded me of the game, and that was the final one in which Milla is gazing out upon the Raccoon City street littered with burning cars and wreckage. It's a sign that Anderson could have actually made a Resident Evil movie if he'd wanted to, but he just didn't. I told myself I'd give this DVD a rental if it proved to be an extended unrated director's cut, with excised blood-n-guts restored, but it looks like this \"special edition\" is going to be nothing more than the sanitized-for-your-protection theatrical edit after all.

Unfortunately,  \"Girl\" isn't up to that standard in any way.  She does what she  can, but the movie is another cliche-ridden teen film.  The supporting cast  makes a great effort, particularly Selma Blair (she must be seen in  \"Cruel Intentions,\" a wonderful comedic performance).  However,  by the end of this film, I found myself wondering why the main character  Andrea was worthy of my attention for 99 minutes.  She doesn't seem to  change or grow significantly, although clearly that was the intention  (i.e., she becomes a woman, not merely a girl, because she stops chasing  after an immature rock singer).\nDespite the somewhat poorly told story,  this is a cut above much of the recent teen-flick product.  Besides the  good performances, I give this film some credit for at least attempting to  treat its subject with a degree of seriousness.  As for the DVD, although  not specified here on the amazon.com listing, there is a short 'making-of'  featurette and a commentary track with the director and Dominique Swain.

{"text": "One of the fringe benefits of a major format change is the inevitable markdowns of old stock of the old format.  I've been taking advantage of the VHS sales in local video stores for quite a while now.  Many of them are dirt cheap, and if you still have a functional VCR and don't demand all the \"extras\" of the DVD format, you can find all kinds of bargains.\n\nAnd all kinds of dross too, unfortunately.  I purchased this movie recently, along with several other films starring Michelle Pfeiffer and was contemplating holding my own personal \"Pfeiffer Film Festival,\" but for better or for worse, I started out with DEEP END OF THE OCEAN and that pretty much nipped those plans in the bud.  I wound up shelving the other entries in the Pfeiffer filmography for another rainy day.  This one was just too depressing.  And I don't mean the content.\n\nI think most people recognize that Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress as well as being a very beautiful woman.  But like many good actresses, she seems to wind up in mediocre film after mediocre film.  Maybe it was ever thus.  How many truly great films did a Katharine Hepburn or a Bette Davis really do in their day.  And Liz Taylor did clunker after clunker in the late 60s and early 70s.  But there was a significant change in recent decades.  Even our biggest stars of today don't carry films the way they once did.  No one goes to see a Michelle Pfeiffer film just because Michelle Pfeiffer is in it these days.  The pressure is on, then, for an actor to pick vehicles worthy of his or her talents.\n\nA number of the reviews I've seen posted here and elsewhere have elaborated on THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN's storyline, so I won't belabor that here.  Suffice to say that the story of a child's kidnapping and the subsequent emotional trauma it inflicts on an entire family is a potentially powerful one.  Pfeiffer heads a strong cast, including Treat Williams as her equally grieving but more resilient husband.  They all have good moments and make the most of their screentime, but the story never quite gels.  And it doesn't get much better when after ten years, the family is abruptly reunited with their lost son.\n\nThe fact that the reunion is highly unlikely is not so much the problem.  I'm not out to revoke anyone's dramatic license here.  What makes no dramatic sense or even common sense is the family's handling of the situation.  In the Age of Oprah, how come no one even considers any kind of counseling for ANYONE in the family.  Many people (and many entire families, of course) are resistant to seeking psychological help, but under such extraordinary circumstances, it's hard to imagine this family not even considering the option.  If not for themselves, how about for the boy?  After all he's been through, even the proudest of families should feel little compunction about his receiving professional help.\n\nLike many other reviewers who have not read Jacquelyn Michaud's acclaimed novel upon which this film is based, I am guessing that this is likely one more case in which the \"book was better.\"  A novel, of course, can indulge in more leisurely pacing, and provide more background and, most importantly, can utilize techniques like interior monologue which contemporary cinema rightly eschews.  (Voiceovers don't cut it--and never did).  I wonder too if the book might not have provided us with some kind of explanation for the evocative title.  There seems to be a trend toward a kind of emotional topography in recent fiction and cinema (not only \"deep ends of the ocean\" but also \"maps of the world\" and of \"the human heart\").  Apparently, they mean something.  The book may make it clear.  The movie doesn't really bother.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The best part of this DVD is the bonus \"Making of Easy Rider\" documentary.  It unintentionally helps to deflate all the current bloated ideas about the significance of this movie.  Take this movie for what it is: a film with two hippies enjoying freedom by riding cool bikes through beautiful scenery with cool music.  Add to it some good acting by Jack Nicholson (which offsets Peter Fonda's atrocious acting) and some fairly good documentation of the zeitgeist, and it's certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.  But don't look to this as a profound comment on life and society, because it's too mixed up and/or lightweight.\n\nWhy was it mixed up?  Partially because everyone except the cinematographer was stoned all the time, including the director Dennis Hopper.  No one was really in charge.  Everyone had big ideas for how things should go, more than half the dialogue was improvised, and lots of other things were determined on the fly as well (after huge arguments). The funniest revelation in the \"Making Of\" documentary was the fact that Hopper's original cut of the movie was three hours long! He apparently thought he was making a huge statement with this thing, but it really just shows his lack of directorial judgement and clear concept of what he was trying to accomplish.\n\nThere's a lot of silly, amateurish symbolism in the film: the scene where Peter Fonda throws off his watch, the simultaneous horseshoeing and motorcycle tire-fixing, the \"Wyatt\" and \"Billy\" cowboy stuff, etc.  The \"Making Of\" documentary reveals that the guys thought they were packing the film with a lot of other symbolism as well, none of it very well done: the cemetary statue that Peter Fonda talks to is supposed to represent the Statue of Liberty; when the plastic tube full of drug money is being shoved inside Peter Fonda's Stars and Stripes gas tank, that's supposed to represent money screwing America; and so on.\n\nWhen the guys producing/directing a film have no real focus,  are making it up as they go along, have no self-editing abilities to begin with, then aggravate that problem by staying stoned all the time, it's expecting too much for there to be a coherent end product.  What is the message of this movie anyway?  There's probably a little morality tale in there somewhere, something along the lines of \"freedom is good, prejudice is bad\", but to read much more than that into it is to wander into a thicket of half-constructed themes that aren't very well thought out or presented.\n\nSo, don't take it too seriously.  It's definitely better than the rest of the biker films of the era, because it doesn't rely on the scandalous antics of depraved Hell's Angels-types.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a rather irreverent and disturbing look at the life of Saint Joan of Arc. The portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity and piety that made the child Joan an attractive character.  However, once Milla Jovovich took over as the teen Joan, she became a  raving lunatic. Clearly, this was no accident. She and director Luc Besson  are husband and wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined  interpretation of Joan.\nThe problem with this portrayal was that Joan was  made to be appear so demented that she lost credibility as a believable  character. Her belief in her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism  than unshakeable faith. Personally, I have no problem with this  interpretation, since I am more apt to believe her voices were the result  of an unbalanced psyche than the voice of God. The problem I have is  believing that anyone, even in the 15th century, would give an army to  someone who is so obviously over the edge. Moreover, it is a stretch to  believe that even the most desperate of simple minded men would follow such  a character into battle.\nIf the portrayal were just a little more  balanced, with moments of piety, sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the  other characters around her might be justified in saying, `Is she divinely  inspired or simply mad?' Only when that question resonates has Joan been  portrayed effectively. In this interpretation there was never any question.  She was clearly a madwoman. It was almost a relief when they finally did  away with her.\nThat being said, I must say that from a technical  standpoint this was a brilliantly directed film. Luc Besson has produced a  compelling visual work of art. The opening scenes of young Joan running  through the fields were exquisite. The battle carnage was authentically  grisly and the action realistic. The costumes were wonderful and the  locations and sets well chosen and well crafted. His camera perspectives  gave great impact to every scene. His imagary of supernatural events was  electrifying. In every regard, other than Joan's character interpretation,  this was an inspired work.\nMilla Jovovich gave a superb performance as  Joan The Mad. Though I don't agree with the interpretation, I can't imagine  such insanity delivered any more effectively. She really seemed well suited  for a jacket with wrap around sleeves. In every scene she exuded white hot  intensity, especially in the battle scenes. Her performance was truly tour  de force.\nFaye Dunaway was fabulous as the cunning Yolande D'Aragon. She  was so nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving.\nJohn  Malkovich did an excellent job portraying Charles VII, however he was a bit  old for the part. Charles was born in 1403 and met Joan in 1429 at the  tender age of 26. Malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no  less 26.\nDustin Hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite  well done. Unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never  really put in context. Was he another of Joan's creations or an actual  being? A little defining dialogue would have helped develop his character  better.\nThis is a fine film with a fatal flaw. If the story is to work,  Joan must be a beloved heroine. In this portrayal, she does not endear  herself to the viewer. Contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting  character. For this reason I rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as  a filmmaking 9 or 10.", "label": 2}

The constant need to convince everybody that a) the neighbor is a vampire, and b) they need to kill the neighbor dragged on and got kinda tired. Then there's the whole dance club scene that killed the flow of the movie for me. It just went on for far too long. Then there's the Evil Ed character, I don't remember him being nearly as annoying as he is to me now. But then again, Sesame Street isn't annoying when you're a kid either.

{"text": "Die Hard on Air Force One with the President of the United States as John McClane?  This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.\n\nIn light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.\n\nThe problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.\n\nI'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.\n\nFor a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?", "label": 2}

{"text": "Two hippies, Wyatt and Billy, drive cross country on their motorcycles in order to blow a lot of money at Mardi gras.  In the process they meet a slew of strange yet vital characters in their eventual understanding of their own existence.\n\nThe problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).\n\n`Easy Rider' is sort of boring.\n\nDennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.\n\nBut, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.\n\nJack playing Jack to perfection.\n\nIn the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.\n\nThis is the definition of a missed opportunity.", "label": 0}

Suffice to say it's a sorely needed if temporary anachronistic antidote to this emasculated age of Oprah, metrosexuals, reality shows, and self-help guides. It'd be a good double feature with Emperor of The North Pole or Fight Club. A good, tight, no-nonsense story that doesn't pull any punches or make apologies.\n\nThe problem with this DVD is the DVD itself. The print is actually decent for a straight 35mm transfer with only a handful of grainy and artifact-ridden scenes. Audio is passable. The big problem is that it's not letterboxed -- entirely pan-and-scan, and noticeably so.

{"text": "This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).\n\nIt's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.", "label": 0}

I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.\n\nI already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.\n\nAfter the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself \"I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act\" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.\n\nThe movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.\n\nUnless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.\n\nThis opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.\n\nI couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.\n\nRecommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films.

Fortunately, that togetherness remains intact. Unfortunately, about ten minutes worth of footage has been edited out and therefore makes this DVD inferior and uncomplete.\nBesides the Muppet family all getting together, I fondly remember a comedy act Fozzy practices with a snowman and about a minute's worth of a Muppet Baby family video.

After all it is the Muppets and even when they are cheated from their just screen time, they make 40 minutes worth of viewing much more enjoyable than most of what can be found on television today.\nI would give this DVD 5 stars, but because of the missing scenes, it's only getting 3.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Punk--at least as it is portrayed in the media--became cliche a long time ago, so the scenes that are intended to show us the punk movement in general terms, such as the party and concert scenes, seemed somewhat passe.  This film's strengths lie in its specifics--the characters and the performances--rather than its portrayal of the milieu they inhabit.  Matthew Lillard is great as Stevo, an achiever who can't find a constructive way to channel his energies, filled with anger about the hypocrisy of the mainstream world he must one day join.  Michael Goorjian is also very good as Heroin Bob, a gentle non-conformist who is terrified of illicit substances.\nAlthough I was never a punk myself, it seems to me that this isn't really a punk movie since it depicts the scene as a way station on the road to either dying or putting on a suit.  For a film with a more subversive attitude, check out \"Repo Man.'", "label": 2}

{"text": "OK so the BBC in the 1970 decided to produce a long runnig series of the lives and loves of the decadent Edwardian rich, only problem, most of the unions in the production studios were on strike. So, do they wait to start work on the series when all the techs are back OR do they just go ahead and film the thing in B&W with poor sound etc etc ....\n\nYup you guessed it .. they started the series in B&W cause the execs at BBC never really expected this series to take off.\n\nThis may have been very good and well back in the 1970's but they should have explained it to the buyers of the DVD set that the first few DVD's of this box set are in B&W and really really bad production... It took  me a while checking my equipment and the disks to realize what they did .. menu in colour and movie in B&W ... thanks!\n\nI sort of expected the DVD set to improve after disk three when it switched to colour but, trust me you could clearly see a substandard production of the 1970's .... I guess for the purists they did nothing to fix the production with today's modern sound, video enhancement programs/computers  ... What you saw is what you got ....\n\nOK so I am really bugged out because I bought the box sets of 'The Forsythe Saga' and of 'Horatio Hornblower' series that were produced and published by the same BBC and A&E people, so you can probably understand why I was so so disappointed with this 'megaset' .....\n\nThe three star rating on this set is certainly deserved by the writing, scriting, casting and most certainly the acting ... the directors and the producers though should be punished....", "label": 2}

{"text": "I watched this movie again last night after not having seen it for about 25 years.  I had almost completely forgotten the plot, except for the ending.\n\nI did not grow up here, but I have lived in the deep south all of my adult life, and as usual the actors in this film have the stereotypical phony Southern \"accents\" -- even Dolly Parton has been too long in Tinseltown.  And even here the accents change somewhat (NC being different from GA, which is again different from an LA parish).  I understand that the rest of America cannot hear it, but native southerners pick right up on the forced sound of the actors.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me this go-round was the obvious change of seasons in the story (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and back to Easter over several years) -- all while the native foliage is in the full bloom of summer.  We do have the four distinct seasons here, and our deciduous trees all turn colors and are then bare by late Fall every year.  However, I don't remember one outdoor scene where the trees were anything but fully green.  It gives the impression to the viewer that the entire movie was shot start-to-finish in about eight weeks.  The IMdB website of this film lists at least 34 shots where there was some flub or mis-continuity, but never mentions the obvious lack of outdoor seasons.\n\nOther than that, a sad and funny film, with a wonderful title theme from Georges Delerue.", "label": 2}

However, I feel that this film does not do the video game classic justice. It DOES have an all new story, and it DOES have all new characters. However, this surprisingly is not the reason that I disliked it. I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE.

There is nothing here that has anything to do with small towns; it is pure Hollywood.\n  Not even the slightest attempt to portray a real small town. I mean ... an underground speak-easy club and a gambling club all in the same small rural Montana town.  Pleeeze give me a break. This isn't Chicago! There aren't enough people there to support that kind of sin infrastructure.\n  The whole movie is so unrealistic, so contrived, so full of paltitudes - it is just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\n  Of course in our times it is lauded as a great tribute to rural America, but it is nothing of the sort. Brad baby never has a hair out of place. He is gorgeous in every shot, as is his brother and everyone in town. No dirt under their finger nails. The people who live in that type of town lack hair stylists and manicurists. They don't look like movie stars and don't act like brats from suburbia. The people in those towns are generally not good looking, they are slow, not to energetic and, well, strange. You'll see nothing resembling that in this glamorati vehicle.\n  The whole moral is that even if you disgrace your family, even if you are a drunk, a blaggart, a loser, a gambler - you really are perfection if you can fly fish. Virtue reduced to fly fishing - so 90s, so now, so trendy of Hollywood's new love of high priced cabins in Montana and long retreats in the mountains. I may not be so virtuous, but I'm a helluva fly fisherman so that's what counts (substitute \"actor\" for \"fisherman\" and you have the formula for Hollywood virtue, i.e. I may be a miserable useless human being but they love me on the big screen).\n  As I said tripe.

{"text": "Well first off this film was far above any expectations that I ever had. I played all the RE games to come out on PC and playstation, anyone who hasn't played them should know that these games are legendary and coined the phrase 'survival horror' to describe their puzzle solving/action/horror/roleplaying style. Playing throught the games themselves is no so far detatched from watching a film as they have story lines (quite good ones too) and closing credits. They are a really great suspensefull and in their own right cinematic experiance.\nAfter the slew of terrible video game films (Mario brothers, the live action street fighter, double dragon, two mortal combats and the extremely [bad] tombraider film) I was expectining a terrible unwatchable film. Anyway I got a hold of a bootleg and was surprised to find that the movie was very decent. The sets are close to the gaming enviourments, especially the train (a scene from the game when the monster attacks throught the wall of the carige is recreated in the film) and the mansion while not the same as RE 1 still had the same feel and decor. The story was in line with the game plots, which is great seenings how I expect some wise guy director to rewrite the story for 'his film'.\nThere is plenty of nail biting suspense, ...But still I cannot bring myself to really like this movie even though it is true to the games simply because it completely lacks any graphic flesh eating scenes. I guess that truely gorey scenes are not in vogue in mainstream horror productions which is a shame because with such a big special f/x budget and some first 20minutes of saving private ryan quality make up, they could have created some truely gut wrenching zombie flesh eating scenes. I mean it is no where near as great as zombie films like braindead (or a hidiously cut dead/alive in the states), dawn/day of the dead, zombie, beyond ect it would be piontless to list the amount of supieror \"zombie\" films, not to memtion it would require more that 1000 words just for the titles.\nSo in conclusion this is hands down the best game to movie adaptation ever!

Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.\n\nThe two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.

They all liked it, and they can't seem to understand why I didn't like this movie as much as they did.  Yes, surprisingly, the movie is close to the games, but it's cheesy and forgets that while it's a movie, things do need to make sense before you can mess them up.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at least, that the movie does manage to help me learn the gist of what happened in the first one.  Now I don't have to watch it.\n\nBut the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\"), which makes the film not scary at all.\n\nThe action sequences were tiring at most.  Too flashy and perfect.  It also seems that characters don't have to have knowlegde of where characters are to find them.  For example, Jill and company are fighting off a group of lickers in the church when Alice comes riding through the cathedral on a motorcyle.  She's completely in gear and ready to go, doesn't sustain any wounds from the glass, manages to flip off the bike and kill all the lickers.  But she somehow knew Jill and company were there.  How?  Forget how cool her entrance was!  And then she manages to KNOW them all?\n\nI'll give the movie this though.  Anyone who was a big fan of Resident Evil 3 will appreciate the costume design for Jill and will REALLY enjoy seeing Nemesis on camara.  Even though the plot twist at the end is predictable (OH MY GOD!  Nemesis is Allice's old partner?  you mean we WEREN'T supposed to see that coming?), it was pulled off pretty well.  It was also stupid that Nemesis ends up helping our main protagonists through a disneylike \"Yeah, we used to be buds\" moment.  In the game Nemesis was a relentless bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.\n\nReally, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.  It's mindless, and the parts that should be funny aren't.  There was nothing really memorable about the film.  For an action film it's shallow, weak, and the main action heroine is much too perfect.  Was John McClane in Die Hard perfect?  Nope, he still got wounded.\n\nFor horror, the movie isn't scary.  Too much of it is ruined by building up too much suspesne.  It comes off as more of a \"OK, let's take bets.  Who is going to die next?\"\n\nReally, this isn't a \"horrible\" movie, just a \"bad\" one.  Go on and buy it if you enjoy a lot of mindless action.  But if you're like me, mindless action DOES have to make a little bit of sense, or else it isn't \"mindless\" it's just \"stupid\".", "label": 0}

{"text": "Really. I grew up loving Robert Redford. And his voice is about the only thing good about this film with the exception of the cinematography (and the native chick's hair). But visuals do not make a story. Please...the book is a separate issue. I can imagine if you read it, this might make a great accompaniment to the story but on its own - uh uh.\n\nYes, it is begging to be some sort of metaphysical contemplative puff piece on the nature of family, love, existence, blah blah blabbity blah! What this film lacks are strong characters, heroes, thoughts, ideas, a plot, and anything else worthy of the concept of \"story\". Is it a visual poem? Maybe. But is it good poetry? Does it show why life is worth living? No. It does show why fly fishing is worth pursuing or why Montana may indeed be a nice place to visit or that all young men should grab a hot native chick off of a reservation and get thrown in jail with her.\n\nLegends of the Fall is infinitely better in every single aspect than this little annoyance if you're into Pitt and the whole Bad Brother routine.\n\nYou know people who love to have coffee table books around, or Marxist dialectical imperative pamphlets lying around that they pretend to read? Or Jean Luc Godard films that they pretend to understand? Well this my friends is the American equivalent. Think Antonioni but without Monica Vitti and Alain Delon. And Eclipse almost made me gouge my eyes out.\n\nIn truth, sans sarcasm, I really wanted to love this film. I did not. I will not. I cannot. As it sadly suckity suck sucks!\n\nGod bless all of you.

{"text": "Not only is Joan of Arc presented as a nut in this film, she's clearly tripping on speed: Jumping out of her skin, screaming her head off and delivering banal lines with halting, eye-bugging intensity.\nIt's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day, let alone follow her into battle.\nMon Dieu! Run awaaaaaayy. . .\nBut I'll say this for the director, he's consistent. It's fast paced all the way through, what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.\n Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed.\nBut as far as the real Joan of Arc, the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony---Oh well, in the first place she's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to  balance this dramatization, and in the second place, as long as we're making films about protagonists who hear voices, wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse.\nHow about: \" Socrates, Herald of Hades! \"\n(sigh)", "label": 0}

True, it launched the  careers of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson.  It featured  some of the best rock music of the time in the soundtrack. The  cinematography is wonderful as well.  So what's the problem?  Well for one  thing the characters are not developed well at all.  By the film's end I  knew little more about them than I did when I started.  It was also fairly  boring too.  It did not move fast at all.  But it is worth a watch if you  want to see some great actors before they hit their prime.

{"text": "I have played none of the video games so I must judge Resident Evil as a movie alone, and this is a good one.\nThere is a disappointing beginning which sets up the movie as standard Hollywood formula (i.e. garbage). As events progress it becomes clear that the writers actually know how to make a good movie (we must keep Hollywood from killing or corrupting them!). There is a scene which looks like a formula-movie contrived ending, but it isn't the end! This gave me a letdown, followed by a swift kick; an incredibly refreshing approach to audience entertainment.\nThe atmosphere becomes extremely intense after the Doomed Elite Team discovers they have been lied to by their employer, the Faceless Evil Corporation. Be warned: There are a lot of cheap scares, especially with the infected bodies (zombies) and I felt that detracted from the overall effect.\nI don't normally get into horror, but Resident Evil is effective.

{"text": "A series of tragic world events seem to signal the End of Days as prophesized in the Book of Revelations, with a pregnant housewife left to decide the fate of the world in THE SEVENTH SIGN! Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. Jrgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation. Only fans of other religious thrillers like THE PROPHECY or STIGMATA will find any interest here.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies", "label": 2}

{"text": "I must say, this movie was interesting in how it carried itself. It reflected a nice idea of how the sub-culture of freedom was mashed with the majority of close-minded fools. It had some of the same ideals I tend to have about the mixing of beliefs.\n\nThe movie gave you plenty of images of how Wyatt and Billy's life could be. Buying their own farmland, living on a commune, or even catering to the majority and living in an all prejudice town. It even talks about the idea of perfect communism (Which is unachievable by man) in Jack Nickolson's UFO speech. You look at the lifestyles of the commune and the two bikers and see how redneck bigotism treats this change from the socially acceptable. There are plenty of subtle messages in this movie that you would have to think about to understand.\n\nI bet almost anyone would tell you that Jack Nickolson portrayed George Hanson better than any being on earth. That's because it's true. Unless you are the redneck bigot as explained above, you can't help, but like George. Sure, he may be a drunkard, but he is the embodiment of activism for freedom and sanity in this world. He just wants everyone to get along. He also shows that even someone from the south does have common sense. This is perfect, considering many pre-judgements upon southern people. You just wish he didn't have to die, but because of how pro-freedom minds were treated, it was inevitable.\n\nAlthough this movie has wonderful ideas and promotes a humanitarian view, it doesn't quite always get the ideas down well. I found the movie to be very plain in the beginning, because I found that to be one of the most boring drug runs I've ever seen on movie. I might have missed something with the planes going over the car, but that seemed like a waste of time to me. It trails you off until you reach the farm and start to see some ideas grow. Another part was Mardi Gras. I felt like that man could have done anything better than he did. It wasn't the drugs that bothered me. It was how they enacted self-demoralization, which I felt wasn't really important to what the movie was trying to say. I was so excited for Mardi Gras and a big let-down fell over me when I saw it. The prostitutes were fun, the idea of going out was amazing, and BAM! I already get proselytized enough. If these things were out of the movie, I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nThe ending couldn't have been more true. This was really the way it had to be, considering the time-frame they want to cover. It had all the things to leave you feeling cold inside. That's the way a strong tragedy ends. This ending was so good, it was covered by the Venture Brothers in the last episode of the first season where the two boys die.\n\nTo head onto the book, I found it almost pointless. It just seemed like a bunch of vanity rolled into ready made bong material. The book could have been perfect if it just had explained all the signs in the movie. No one cares about Fonda picking his nose. Unless you want to, of course.\n\nThe biggest failure of this movie is how corporate capitalism rips off the public with it's \"songtrack\". People want to watch the movie and if they like the music, listen to the full version soundtrack. If you want to buy this, get the non-special edition.\n\nOverall it was worth watching and maybe more of a rentable than a buyable.", "label": 2}

{"text": "There honestly isn't much I can say in favor of The Messenger.  The acting is terrible, the technical elements are a mess, and the movie leaves to many critical elements unexplained.  Worse still, the movie claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' but utterly ignores the historical evidence on Joan.\nUnlike so many other bad movies, the horrendous technical elements make this movie almost unwatchable.  Le Hire looked like a refugee from Mad Max.  Some of the buildings look like they were designed by amateurs.  The church, for instance, near Orleans was actually shorter than Joan on horseback while the castles sported bizarre chutes designed to drop cannonballs onto invaders.  Even minor details, such as the ever-changing color of Jovovich's hair show nothing short of sloppy continuity and bad design.\nBad acting only complicates the situation.  Milla Jovovich, inexplicably, maintains the same expression throughout the entire movie - up to and including during Joan's burning.  Ms. Jovovich has said that were Joan alive today she would be sitting in an internet cafe sipping coffee.  Unfortunately, such utter misunderstanding carries over into her performance.  Her performance manages to portray Joan as a delusional maniac with zombie-like expressiveness.  Le Hire was portrayed as a caricature of a barbarian and lacked any real sense of definition.  The only decent acting jobs were by Tommy Lee Jones and Dustin Hoffman.  Jones put forward a solid, if somewhat lacking and one-dimensional, performance as Charles.  While I don't agree with his interpretation of the character, I can appreciate the skill that went into creating the role.  Hoffman was simply superb.\nHowever good Hoffman's portrayal was, it brings up one of the serious problems in the movie.  His role is never explained, let alone supported historically.  He shows up in Joan's cell, questions her actions (it should be noted here that the directing here was really distracting, particularly the frequent cuts from the cell to the brightly-lit exteriors and back), and somehow turns in a very good performance.  He brings a lot of class to an underdeloped, pointless role.  It should be noted that this is the only high point in the movie.\nMy biggest complaint with The Messenger is that it claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc' and bears little to no resemblence to the historical record.  Despite theories to the contrary, Joan was no fanatic - this charge was never even made by her enemies - and that is what the movie insists on portraying her as.  Similarly, the entire motivation for Joan's actions, the death and rape of her mother, is pure fabrication.  Isabelle Romee, Joan's mother, actually survived Joan by almost 20 years and was instrumental in getting her daughter's condemnation lifted.  Artistic license is one thing, but if you want to tell 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' actually *tell* the story rather than resorting to utter fiction.\nThe lesson here is to avoid movies made simply to showcase the director's girlfriend.  That's why The Messenger was made and it further illustrates the lack of respect the director and cast (Hoffman and Jones excepted) had for the material.  Its false claims to tell a historical story are dangerous and irresponsible, while bad elements and design make for an unpleasant experience.", "label": 0}

First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses.  Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused.  The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house.

But, with that said.....the good far out-weighs the bad in this film....the cast is marvelous and so is the music.  I have long been a fan of the stage show....so my one big complaint about the film is the changing of the ending from Christmas to July 4th. If my memory serves me correctly this film was a summer release, so that may the reason for the change of holiday.  Christmas just works so much better in the story.

They make me so mad with all those lies but hey it's just a game... Ok now here are the facts..\nPROS:\nVery nice Commentary w/ Milla Jovoich (Actor), Michelle Rodriguez(Actor) , Paul Anderson (Director), Jeremy Bolt (Head Producer).\nVery good acting, I personally liked Milla Jovoich's kicks and moves, she's good!\nEnough Action to satisfy anyone... Lots of Zombies\nCONS:\nThe parts of the game they put in here are not very well designed, for instance, The Licker. The Licker is the weird bizarre creature we find in Resident Evil 2 on the ceiling of a Police Station in Raccoon City. Well see the thing is that this Licker design in the movie is not completely a clone of the one from the game, so it's not quite like The Licker you'll see in RE:2.\nNot well Budgeted..... This movie was not well budgeted and here is why... When you see that lady in the elevator about to get her head chopped off after the T-Virus is released, why don't they show the head get chopped off? LOL Michelle Rodriguez complains about that on the commentary. This movie is Rated R so why can't they show that much gore? Paul Anderson (director) said that the movie had insufficient funds to possibly make gore and stuff. So that was lame. Also Michelle never got to use her knife, and it was because they didn't have enough time or money to show zombie guts getting taken out.\nThe Ending was terrible.... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENS! THATS SO ANNOYING YOU CAN'T JUST GET AWAY WITH THAT! The ending leaves you wondering if Matt turns into Nemesis cause that doctor says \"I want him in the Nemesis program\". And where is Jill Valentine? Where is Brad Vickers? I will give them credit on one condition.... IF THEY PUT JILL VALENTINE IN THERE! WHAT THE HECK WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE IN RESIDENT EVIL 3 THE CITY IS NUKED AT THE END! So how could Alice (milla jovoich) possibly get out of Raccoon City? Thats gonna be an outrage if they do not put something about Jill Valentine on there. Also they MUST have Nemesis! They must because he was part of the story!\nFinal Point: This movie is good but not great.... The story line isn't good enough.... But lemme tell you the commentary is great, one of the first I've been happy to hear. So good bye yalls and thanks for reading", "label": 2}

Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.\n\nIf you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube.

{"text": "British director John Boorman's 1968 consideration of the  tremendously vicious hemispheric Pacific conflict of WW II is a brief, but unfortunately unsatisfying examination of the here leaderless, very dirty hand-to-hand combat that was island-hopping in the war.  Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese \"star\" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?

Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy (Fargo), Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and Timothy Carhart (Beverly Hills Cop III).

{"text": "\"Resident Evil\" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.\n\nI spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike \"Blade.\"\n\nAs stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some \"Mortal Kombat\"-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to \"Mortal Kombat.\"  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  \"Resident Evil\" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.\n\nThe horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of \"jump-at-you\" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.\n\nAs far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of \"making of\" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to \"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.\n\nOverall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.", "label": 2}

Any surprises here? Unfortunately not - the formula has been squeezed just a little too much for any real shocks, but it does maintain a steady pace and is a pretty watchable and thankfully short movie.\n\nStarring the cleavage-based talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is essentially a vehicle allowing said actress as well as Brandy to wear the skimpiest clothes possible. From this angle, the movie does not disappoint. The producer Neal H. Moritz claims he wanted this movie to be scarier than the original; in my mind he failed by a long shot. However, the production is slick and tight, the sound is glorious and the image is close to perfection, and I am sure many will enjoy it; men maybe more than women though - sexist remark as it may be, but Jennifer Love Hewitt didn't land this role for nothin'!", "label": 2}

From there, things get even sillier.\nAnother thing that makes this film fun to watch is the skillful animation of Terry Gilliam. The cartoon segment where King Arthur and his men encounter God is especially funny as is the scene where Arthur and his men run away from the dreaded black beast.\nEssentially, THG is a compilation of funny skits that are loosely held together by a contrived plot. THG is one movie that will definitely keep you in stitches but it will also let you down as the ending is rather weak--to say the least!\nHaving seen this film several times over the past two decades, it seems to me that THG was more than the Python gang could handle. This film has an aura of impatience about it and it seems that the Python troupe were glad to get it done and over with.

{"text": "You'll love every minute of this three hour movie. Filmed in Morocco, this treatment of the rags to riches biblical story explores the political intrigue of Joseph's polygamous family and subsequently the Egyptian court. Joseph has long been regarded as a forerunner of Jesus, and the movie alludes to this similarity several times. In fact, Joseph's story is an Old Testament illustration of Jesus' observation that \"no prophet is accepted in his own country,\" (Luke 4:24). Joseph's talent for interpreting dreams provokes his brothers to sell him into slavery, but the same talent proves enormously profitable for him in Egypt.\n\nPerhaps the most relevant connection between the 1995 movie and the present time is the debate over prosperity theology, which proposes that one can enjoy God's blessings --particularly health and wealth-- on earth. Joseph, as portrayed by the athletic Paul Mercurio, is certainly capable of fighting back against his oppressors, but instead of physical aggression, he chooses to assert himself through faith, talent, honesty, and impressive political courage --attributes which eventually earn him riches in Egypt.\n\nFollowers of prosperity theology are seen by some Christians as heretics who love money, but the Joseph movie is an epic struggle for the good life, and it raises larger questions. Don't most Christians work for a better life? Don't they repeat refrains, such as \"God helps those who help themselves\" and \"When opportunity knocks, answer the door\"? Is the ascetic life advocated by the Bible practical or even responsible in the postmodern world? Was Joseph as a long suffering slave morally superior to Joseph as a rich governor who saved Egypt and its neighbors from death by famine? Several biblical characters have inspired many an inspirational film, but the Joseph movie strikes at the heart of money's problematic role in Christian life.", "label": 1}

{"text": "One of the staples of the slasher genre has been the quick turnaround for a sequel.  While the 90s resurgence in the genre tried to change many things about the genre, the quick sequel was not one of them.  Thats why, a year after the first came out, we got I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  It needed more time to iron out some serious plot issues (and considering this is a slasher, thats saying something).\n\nAs the movie opens, its been a year since fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson) stalked Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray (Freddie Prinz, Jr.)  and their friends and two years since the four friends hit Ben with their car and left him for dead.  Julie is still struggling through all that has happened, which is why she finds herself struggling with grades while in summer school again and having recurring nightmares.\n\nThings are looking up when her friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to the Bahamas over the 4th of July.  When an invited Ray doesnt show, Julies friend Will (Matthew settle) joins Carla, Carlas boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Julie for this trip.  They arrive on the island just before the first storm of the season hits, leaving them stranded as the only guests on the island.  But a message for Julie leaves her convinced that they and the skeleton staff are in danger.  Is she right?  And what happened to Ray?\n\nThe film actually gets high marks right away for addressing the tag from the previous film and trying to give us some character development for Julie and Ray.  Unfortunately, in an effort to increase the tension, we get several painfully obvious false scares before we get to the island and the movie really begins.\n\nNow heres the part where Im going to be painfully stupid.  One of my problems with this film is all the people who are killed when Julie and Ray are the real targets.  I get that this is a slasher film.  I truly do.  That means lots of people have to die.  But I don't get why we are going after the people who do die.  In the first film, the collateral damage victims make a little bit of sense, but not quite as much here.  And this doesnt bother me in the Scream films like it does here, either.  Go figure.\n\nSo leaving my personal issues aside, we do get some decent stalk and kill sequences and a mix of sympathetic and annoying characters to be eliminated.  This part is all well done, and when the storm hits and the killing starts, its easy to feel the tension building.\n\nWhich brings me to the part that feels rushed.  In an effort to provide a twist to the story (required of all slashers, especially during the 90s), we learn a bit more about Ben, but none of that makes sense.  Even watching the movie knowing what will unfold, it feels like it is forced into the film.\n\nAnd, despite efforts to set things up earlier, the climax still feels a bit du ex machina for my tastes.  Then theres one characters fate, which makes no sense.  Plus don't get me started on the final scene.  What worked in the first film definitely doesnt work here.\n\nThe acting is still decent, and I don't find anything to pull me out of the film.  Thats impressive considering the script the cast had to work with.\n\nAnd Id be remiss if I didn't point out that the accident that started the whole rampage was actually two summers ago now, so the title really doesnt work either.\n\nThe thing with 90s slasher movies is they tried to be more intelligent than the ones that had come during the slasher mania of the 80s.  Sadly, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer fails in those efforts.  There are still some decent death and chase sequences, so die hards of the genre will want to check it out.  But be sure to turn off your brain before you start watching it.", "label": 2}

This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what \"A Hard Days' Night\" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.

{"text": "i've seen my share of adaptations of this great story and i'm convinced that there is just too much going on to be able to fit it into 108 minutes of film. still this is pleasurable and i would give it 3.5 stars if allowed.\n\nif given a longer production and more loyalty to the book, i could imagine this would have been a particularly wonderful adaptation. ciaran hinds and samantha morton are wonderful as rochester and jane. i really enjoy watching their performances. i can feel their frustrations and passions. their conversations are powerful although condensed. hinds is an amazing actor, and i enjoyed his portrayal. morton - although hindered by a short script/movie - was excellent. i am convinced morton's portrayal of jane eyre is the best out of all the adaptations i have seen. this makes it particularly disappointing that she (and hinds) were not allowed to fully incorporate all the details of the book, spread out over hours of film. ah yes indeedy, that would be sweet.\n\nso i think the only 'problem' i have with this adaptation is the length and the resulting lack of true-to-book dialogue and story-lines somewhat external to the rochester/jane focus, such as her prolonged visit to her dying aunt, and the real way she met up with mr. rivers and his sisters, and how she inherited a fortune from her uncle. of these ommited or condensed things, i especially miss the grand debates between jane and edward. it doesnt allow the viewer to fully experience the chase, to savor their growing desperate love and passion. (the dalton/clarke 1983 version and the jayston/cusack 1973 version both are long features which follow the book much more closely, if that is what you are looking for.)\n\nhowever, the condensed story and deviations from the book do not take away from the actor's performances. for example, i found the final scene particularly wonderful. when she finds him a broken man, and he tries to cast her off for her own good, she refuses, and he cries for all his past pains and and present joys. hinds, as i said, is amazing.", "label": 2}

Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy.

Wrong! I was right. The movie is great.  I really do not understand how any one can NOT like this movie. AND I HAVE  SEEN A LOCAL PRODUCTION OF ''ANNIE'' RECENTLY. The play, like the 1999  movie is quite nice, but it just doesn't have that spark, and liveliness  that this movie does. What would lead others to call this movie ''charmless  and dull'' is beyond me. I do not agree at all. I have read many reviewers  trying to persuade potential viewers into seeing or buying the new 1999  movie version. ( I have also read an extremely biased nasty review by a  ''Lori.'') I have news for all those desiring to see the new version: it is  a sweet, nice version. But there is no comparison. That movie perhaps does  have a better sense of setting than this old version.( and the play I saw  did have an enjoyable song called '' We'd like to thank you Herbert  Hoover.'') After seeing the play, I wish some of the songs could have been  included here. But the play seemed missing something. People call this  movie ''overblown... happening in a void, overacted...''But this movie was  really TRYING. The actors were confidant, and gave STRONG performances. (  While Alicia Morton as Annie, gave a quiet, calm, quite lifeless  performance, and Andrew Garber as Daddy Warbucks can never compare with  Albert Finney.) I do agree some good songs were left out- and I wish those  had been added here. But certain scenes:( the car chase, the interaction  between Hannigan, and Warbucks) are sorely missed in the new version. This  movie does add a lot of things to the musical. But new characters, and  overlaying, enthusiastc plots make the movie multi-faceted to me anyway.  Plus a lot of songs such as '' We've got Annie'', ''Sign'', and '' Dumb  Dog.'' are very enjoyable. All in all, this seemed to me a nice movie, and  very enthusiastically produced.", "label": 2}

It's not great but it's hardly  the worst movie either. Sarah Michelle Gellar is basically playing Buffy without powers and without the neurosis. She's saddled with a cute but dumb as dirt boyfriend who, like the boyfriend in The Ring turns out to be fairly useless. Since I brought up The Ring I have to say that my first feeling about the Grudge was that it was a Ring rip off. When the ghost comes crawling down the stairs it looks just like Samara Morgan coming out of the TV but after watching a few Japanese horror movies I've come to the conclusion that the ghosts in this particular genre tend be grotesquely misshapen things that creep and have messy hair.\n\nThe Grudge was okay.

{"text": "I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released. I'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters. The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who):\n\"Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.\"\nThat about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.\nSean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.\nThere are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.\nThe final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Director:  Andrew Niccol\n\nCast:  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Jayne Brook, Elias Koteas.\n\nRunning Time:  106 minutes\n\nRated PG-13 for brief violent images, language, and some sexuality.\n\n\"Gattaca\" is intended as a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. The film takes place in a future world, not too far removed, where destiny is determined by genes: all babies (except for a few \"accidents,\" known as \"invalids\") are genetically engineered to near-perfection, people are hired on the basis of their genetic profile, and the imperfect products of accidental births are relegated to low-status menial jobs. Our hero, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), is an \"invalid\" who wants to rise above his genetic destiny. So, in an elaborate scheme, he buys the identity of Eugene Morrow, a genetically perfect athlete crippled in an accident, and gets the job he always dreamed about in a space-exploration program.  When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered; however, investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity, and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his life-long dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene (Uma Thurman) and Jerome on his side, Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build.\n\nThe film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone, and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.', Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us, as a natural species, obsolete.  Director Andrew Niccol (\"Lord of War\") has done a fine job in transforming this sci-fi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular, but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure, with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it, and this is made very clear from beginning to end.  The acting performances are all very adequate, but the stand-out ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, who seem so comfortable in their characters and, truth be told, share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films, and it is a remarkably impressive debut.  Basically, this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection, people still suffer, the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold, 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind, the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we, as a society are truly striving for.", "label": 2}

But on the whole, if you  want to see a film featuring everything from baddies in teddy bear costumes  to mechanical wasps(that's right) to Uma Thurman in a cat suit(it looks  nice on her actually) and an equally daft and strange plot, then this film  is for you.

The Special Tactics and Rescue Squad gets stuck in a mansion full of Zombies, Mutant Dogs, Frogs, Spiders, Bees, Sharks, you name it, they've got it, and an excellent character cast to go with it. Instead, they chuck it all out except for the mansion, the Zombies, the dogs, and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. And gore wise, it's pretty clean compared to the games.

This film features some spoofs to classic horror films like \"The Shining\", \"The Evil Dead\" or \"The Night Of The Living Dead\". As a matter of fact, \"Idle Hands\" works better as a comedy than as a horror film.\n\n The cast includes a lot of young actors like Devon Sawa (Anton), Seth Green (Mick), Elden Hensen (Pnub) and Jessica Alba (Molly). We already know that Seth Green is very funny and Jessica Alba is charming, but the surprise in this movie is Devon Sawa. He uses a lot of physical tricks and shakes his hand in a funny and convincing way.\n\n The plot is kinda silly and obviously has holes here and there, but the dialogues are the main attraction here, the characters talk in double sense, with irony and black humor, and they make a lot of funny references to Anton's hand, Pnub's severed head or the bottle inserted into Mick's head.\n\n This an amusing movie, it's good enough to entertain the audience for 90+ minutes, the MTV 2 soundtrack features tracks performed by bands like The Offspring, Rancid and Rob Zombie. \"Idle Hands\" is a movie for young people looking for laughs, it's much better than the average teenager slasher flick.

{"text": "Director:  Danny Cannon\n\nCast:  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson, Bill Cobbs, Mathew Settle, Jeffrey Combs, Jennifer Esposito.\n\nRunning Time:  100 minutes\n\nRated R for intense terror violence and gore, strong language and some drug use.\n\nIt might not have been the greatest movie ever made but, thanks to the canny direction and score, \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" was a very effective thriller. Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.\n\nYou can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated \"Judge Dredd\" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. \"I Still Know...\" fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying \"shocker\" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years.

{"text": "This is a review of the 2014 Blu-ray release.\n\nI never understood why this movie didn't do better.  Perhaps because it didn't take itself seriously - it is, after all, an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies - so maybe we feel like we shouldn't take it seriously either.\n\nArnold by this time had well established himself as an action hero, indeed THE action hero to many.  But he had also starred in several successful comedies, such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop.  And while there is plenty of action in this movie, it is more a comedy than an action movie.  It is surprisingly (and refreshingly) self-aware in its analysis of the fictional reflection of our real world that exists only in the movies - sort of a modern-day Alice Through the Looking Glass.  Whether mocking that there are no ordinary-looking women in the movies, only gorgeous models; or the impossibility that all phone numbers begin with \"555\", this movie asks us to examine the holes in the fictional reality we are fed in the movie theater, rather than overlook them.  It is not often that we get a refreshingly honest script as this.\n\nUnfortunately, this Blu-ray presentation leaves something to be desired.  The transfer is a bit soft, with weak blacks, and even some fuzzy blurring to the edge of the image in at least one scene (the last projection booth scene).  There are ZERO extras, (not even a trailer), and the menu consists of one choice - \"Play Movie\".  No soundtrack or subtitle options.  Obviously Columbia has not shown the love to this movie.  So, much as I regret it, this Blu-ray only gets 3 stars, due to the quality of the transfer.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  This really is a gem of a movie.", "label": 2}
{"text": "THE EYES OF LAURA MARS D: Irvin Kershner (1978) Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Raul Julia, Rene Auberjonois, and assorted disco-era models and fashionistas\n\n  Jon Peters' first production as he transformed himself (with girlfriend Barbra Streisand's help) from hairdresser to movie producer, the movie is a gem of Seventies style at it's finest. The clothes, the hair, makeup, music, attitude, interiors and locations ride the crest of the high-style wave that flooded the world through the Eighties. Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion, with a story that centers on a famous photographer (Dunaway) and her ability to *see* her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered, *Eyes* has moments of serious suspense, but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton, the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to, but then, again, this movie was *made* in 1978, not 20 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch, with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models, clad in garter belts and fur coats get in a cat fight before the camera. The ingenuous use of *real* models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed disco-dancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie, and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment: Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press *why* violence is important in fashion photos.", "label": 2}

There was a director of the name George. A.romeo.\nHe is the genious behind the zombie movies such as Day of the dead. His R.E script wasn't approved because he wrote the names of the real characters in his script. This is when Anderson was transferred and decided to change the whole script by using everything in his little imagination.\nNO ORIGINAL CHARACTERS AND STORY\nSo how can this movie be a success, if the director cant even create the original characters of the game and get the authentic storyline. Not one original character is present in the movie, which is a huge dissapointment to the fans and CAPCOM's unappreciated efforts of creating the brilliant characters.\nNO HORROR\nThe other major dissapointment is that the zombies and dogs looked pathetic, which i found more real terror in the 32bit game itself.\nThe movie should be aimed at children who enjoy watching goosebumps instead of being aimed at ages above 15.\nSPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY\nI would recomend you R.E fans or just horror lovers to think twice before buying this movie. If you are a R.E fan you are better off buying the resident evil comics, because the story and characters are related to the game. If you are a zombie horror fan, i recomend you to buy movies directed by George.

I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money.

{"text": "Besson's film on the legendary Joan of Arc leaves mixed results. Although he presented an original angle in showing her to be less than heavenly inspired, Besson has seriously and uneffectively distorted several documented facts about Joan of Arc. This is rendered worse by a bad script and questionable acting.\n\nAll historical accounts suggest that Joan of Arc was soberly persistent in her pleas for the Dauphin to give her an army but she was never the delusional psychotic as shown in the movie. Her visions were inspired by the Saints and not by Christ Himself. All accounts are conclusive in that Joan of Arc was leading as a symbol of inspiration to the army and never once raised a weapon against the enemy: she never shed any blood. Finally, Joan of Arc never reneged her faith or retracted her statements about her divine mission: that's why she was put on the stake.\n\nThe film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.  The battle and siege scenes are interesting but perhaps a little exaggerated.\n\nThe movie is perhaps worth renting once but this is certainly not the best rendition on this most intriguing of Christian saints/martyrs.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I was so excited when I heard A&E was doing \"Jane Eyre,\" especially when I heard Ciaran Hinds was cast as Rochester. I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of \"Pride and Prejudice.\" I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!\nMy main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. \"I feel your passions are aroused\"? I found myself screaming at the screen \"he'd never say that!\"\nMy second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.\nI did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak.\nThe Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite. Too bad Hinds and Morton didn't have that script and that director!", "label": 0}

{"text": "My kids found this movie amusing and, reading the reviews here, I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thought this was not a very good vampire flick. I liked the story line but the acting in some cases (Stephen Geoffreys and Chris Sarandon) was quite shoddy. I loved the \"seduction\" music and was a bit ticked when I bought the tape and found it a vocal instead of the sexy sound I heard in the movie.\n\nWilliam Ragsdale was quite good as Charlie, all hormones and teenage lust, and still fairly normal in spite of his dingbat mother. Amanda Bearse is sweet. I liked her maturing transformation on the dance floor. In fact, this is Sarandons one good moment in the film. The dance is all about seduction and he does an incredible job. As long as he isn't trying to actually spout lines he does all right. Stephen Geoffreys was bloody awful and I do not find it a mystery that I've seen him in nothing since.  Johathan Stark as the modern day \"Igor\" is very, very good. A great addition to a small budget film and I wouldn't mind seeing him in other things, he was that believable.\n\nRoddy McDowall is not a great film actor. Maybe he is better on the stage, I don't know. However, he gives an adequate performance here as PETER VINCENT, VAMPIRE KILLER. I think Vincent Price (who I adore and who was also NOT a great actor), could have had a ball in this role and it's a shame that he didn't get the chance to try. Regardless, McDowall also has some fun here and he is amusing to watch.\n\nTo me, this is a nice old vamp flick, good with popcorn and a group of teenie-boppers. I don't think the older teens will like the lack of special effects and adults will see the lack of acting talent.  Great to rent, good to buy only if you get a good deal on the price.", "label": 2}

{"text": "It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster.  Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense, and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc.\nUnfortunately, Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick.  There are a number of \"spirtual\" moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God.  However, it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other.\nUnfortunately for Besson, this is the first movie to involve knights, castles, and battles since Braveheart(Gibson, 1995) which seems to have become the obvious comparison.  Even the \"revenge\" story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart \"righteous revenge\" theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger.\nEven an \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger, you will really feel that you have seen it all before.", "label": 0}

{"text": "The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are \"ghosts\" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the \"wronged parties\" or \"ghosts\" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really \"get\" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless. On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in \"Lie to Me\", and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the \"ghosts\" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in \"Out of Mind Out of Sight\" from season one.", "label": 2}

The finale is a little subdued, as well.\nNevertheless,  it's a fun film.

{"text": "I do not like Sinatra, and as someone once said, Joey is the role he was born to play.  A self-important little heel.  I think he had a very slight singing voice (with orchestral delusions of grandeur, look at the arrangement of his \"Softly, As I Leave You\") and I think he was a megalomaniac.  Also, before I drop the subject, the tune in this flick that floored all the other reviewers here (\"The Lady Is A Tramp\") was written for a woman and has many more, and many cleverer choruses, and was written for \"Babes in Arms,\" not \"Pal Joey.\"  Rita Hayworth (whose character, Vera Simpson, was just rich on the stage) plays a former stripper, not a former singer.  And her number, \"Zip!\" has words in it not even written by Hart!  The plot of the show (par for Hollywood) was bowdlerized, rewritten and destroyed for the flick, and left simplistic and with most of its songs gone.  Good ones too.  I've read O'Hara's libretto and I've heard the score.  The film is a colorful diversion (like the films of Porter's \"Can-Can\" and Loesser's \"Guys and Dolls,\" both also with Sinatra, both also eviscerated and abridged, though Loesser fared best of the three), it'll kill an hour and a half, Rodgers' tunes are done well (as well as non-singers can do them), O'Hara and Hart are rewritten with only the bare bones left, but in 2003, who really cares anymore.

{"text": "This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a \"star vehicle\" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.\n\n\"Air Force One\" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?\n\nThe Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.\n\nFord mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.\n\nDon't expect a tremendous amount from \"Air Force One.\" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief.

It is easier to follow than Ju-On and it is easier to keep track of who are the characters. It doesn't have the same creepy feel to it that Ju-On had and some of the jumps come off as comical instead of scary. There are a couple of good scenes that will make you jump in your seat, and it isn't a waste of money to rent or even buy it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in the movie, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I would say that if you haven't seen Ju-On then you will like the Grudge. If you have seen Ju-On, then the movie seems more like a pale comparison rather than original. It is a fun movie and not as violent as Ju-On, which I believe was rated R, but it never really gets into your head the way Ju-On managed to creep you out. If you compare it to The Ring (another American remake), it doesn't stand too well because The Ring was able to live up to the original.

Since Alice wasn't in any of the games and this film is supposed to be about the third Resident Evil game, this puts the film in the \"it's kind like but kinda not like the game\" category, so you don't even know where it exists in the canon of the games' storyline. Second, some of the plot points are incredibly stupid from the start. After all, why would a corporation design a research facility with a special security system designed to seal the place off should something disasterous happen and then try to reopen the facility not once but TWICE once something so bad happens that the place needs to be sealed off? Couldn't they take the hint the first time they reopened the place and lost an entire Special Ops team inside? And wasn't the guy that escaped that was infected with their T-Virus enough of a hint that there had been a T-Virus outbreak? The logic that sets this film in motion is so annoyingly flawed. You'd think a major coporation like Umbrella was smarter than this. They could have at least tried to explain it off that the Hive was reopened with the purpose of letting the T-Virus escape to see how effective their bio-weapon was in a major city? That's one of the explanations they give in the game, but they don't even do that in the film.\n\nSecond, why are they giving Alice more and more powers? How are we supposed to relate to her? Part of the appeal of zombie films - or most films in general - is that you can relate to the characters. You can mentally put yourself in their position, and you worry about their well-being. But what happens when the character you're supposed to relate to becomes so powerful they can do somersaults, know tons of martial arts out of the blue, and can kill people with telepathy? Alice becomes so powerful and superhuman, you never fear she won't survive. It's called the Superman Syndrome - a character becomes so powerful, that you don't care what happens to them because you already know.\n\nNow there's the Nemesis. They turn a badass killing machine into a good guy in the end! Part of what makes some villains so fun is that they're so bad - they're so bad, they're good. That was part of the appeal of Nemesis. But instead, they turn him into a kinder, gentler Nemesis who saves the day in the end.\n\nThe Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look \"cool\". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.\n\nThe first film spent half its running time zombie-free, as they tried to set up suspense and that's pretty understandable. This time around, there should be zombies galore, right? But the plotting is so damn slow, you almost forget there are zombies in the film! And even when the zombies are on-screen, they use this filming style that looks like choppy stop-motion animation! Who thought this was a good idea in post-production? Whoever has this film editor hired now on ANY film, fire them immediately.\n\nUPDATE - This visual characteristic is called \"dropping frames,\" and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is \"dropped\". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.\n\nI'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.\n\nAnd I'm certain that the only reason they made it possible to kill the zombies by snapping their necks was to tone down the gore and get it past the MPAA with an R rating, not to mention that video games still have the \"just kid's stuff\" reputation, and thus movies based on video games suffer a similar stigma so they have to be toned down for \"the kids.\" But this is supposed to be a ZOMBIE FILM, it's supposed to be gory! The games, which are supposedly \"just kid's stuff,\" actually have MORE gore than the movies made about them. So as far as zombie films go, the Resident Evil films are pretty tame. Hell, they could have gone with more gore, taken it out so the film could get an R, then put it back in for an Unrated Version on DVD. That would have been more acceptable than these zombie film abominations.\n\nAnd am I the only one who is so tired of the blue tint they see in every action/sci-fi film since The Matrix? I haven't been to a single city where the lighting is blue EVERYWHERE at night. Enough with the blue lighting, damn it.\n\nBelieve me, if I could have given this film 0 Stars, I would have. This is truly a horrible film. Horrible-looking, horribly-written, horribly-directed, and so on. It's such a shame that video games are being so poorly represented on film this way.", "label": 0}

I'm a big Arnold fan, but this kind of role just wasn't meant for him.  He's a great action star, but the depth of emotions the main character has to go through would have been better served by another actor.

Instead of just handing you joan of arc on a plate, ready to eat, this movie says \"Who is Jeanne?\" This movie takes you in the direction of \"What if?\" rather than saint hood. It asks \"What else?\" instead of feeding you glory.\n\nOther than some risky directing by Luc Besson (made me laugh at times) and some weak character development, it's a definite watch for anyone who loves a good drama, and anyone who wants to get a different look at the famous saint.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone \"Party, and you'll be alright.\" It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right \"We Blew It.\" I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album \"Do What You Like\".", "label": 0}

{"text": "Luc Besson looks now as a man with the Midas touch  surprised for the first time in his life by the result. The thing he'd touched did not turn to gold but to something less valuable - something more like copper.\nI  was stunned by Nikita - no one was expecting such a cool and modern action  movie from a French director. Professional was much more kitschy but still  enjoyable. The Fifth Element's visuals were so exciting no one really cared  about the content and just enjoyed the extravaganza.\nNow it seems Luc  Besson was carried away and decided he can create a masterpiece just from a  scrap - from his girlfriend's photo to be exact(see the DVD's  leaflet).\nHe employs and directs the team of very skillful cameramen and  costume designers, gets the adequate funding - it's easy for the most  popular French director planning to tell the story of the most famous  French heroine - employs the most handsome French actors and invites some  Americans. Like an experienced pyrotechnic he puts together the fabulous  fireworks expecting them to burst in the sky in many-colored blaze.\nWhat  we have instead? Psssshhhhhhhhhick.\nWhy?\nObviously Luc Besson has  nothing to say about Joan of Arc.  He had no coherent idea to express -  just action, design and music.\nThere are 3 definite parts in the film -  The Visions, The Battle, The Trial.\nWhen he feels one more vision would  be one too much Luc Besson lets the battle begin. Battle scenes are a genre  in themselves, they can hold the viewer's attention with the gory action  and display of curious war machines, weaponry and armour. But after an hour  it all began to look too much. That is 101th time we are shown \"The  True Face Of War\" in recent years, all these crows pecking dead flesh  and oozing bloody limbs lying all over are something we expect to see -  their's shocking potential is exhausted.\nWhat's next ? The Trial. Nothing  memorable here. Dustin Hoffman contributed his name to the film's posters  and DVD covers. I am sure it helped to sell hundreds thousand of tickets  and copies extra, but the role is just ridiculous. Hoffman in gray beard  and hooded robe looks barely recognizable  - his best disguise since  Tootsie. In a sadistic monotone he is stubbing the girl with his stupid and  pretentious questions.\nBy the way - no doubt that was a fashion these  days but Faye's shaven forehead makes her look so much like RoboCop I could  not concentrate on her words - just enjoyed the unexpected  similarity.\nBut! I think that Milla is perfectly cast. Of course first of  all she is a model, but do we need a Meryl Streep for the role of young  peasant girl, the messenger, the medium? And the girl is so suitably  androginous yet sexy, great to look at  - since the film is obviously not  \"serious\" I'd prefer to see Milla in a leading role, not someone  with richer inner life but not-so-perfect body.\nBesides, she is a fellow  Slav. Any French actress with Gallic calculated charm and sophistication  could not be credible in her fervour.\nThe dialogues are contemporary.  When I saw Joan stopping her adjutant on his way out of her chamber to ask  for a hairdresser I was struck by the realisation that Ms. Jovovich in her  The Ritz suite would communicate with a valet in exacctly the same  tone,with the same gesture.\nMost of the reasoning and the concepts worded  are clearly does not belong to the Middle Ages.\nMusic is so predictable  you hear just what you expect to hear.\nAnd the burning scene is so  abrupt! I did not plan to contemplate the death throes, but to finish the  160-minutes long film in the 2-minute haste...\nStill I can not call the  movie a complete flop. There are some images - Milla with boyish face  and  man's haircut on her white horse, raising the banner,etc - that will stay  in public consciousness.

{"text": "Throughout the years, the story of Joan of Arc has stimulated the production of several motion pictures. Her life, actions and words have inspired and intrigued for more than five hundred years. From a historical standpoint, it is unfortunate that we do not know enough about Joan of Arc's life to fully understand who she was and what she did. While what she accomplished cannot be denied, and her recorded letters, speeches and trial manuscripts form a profile, much of what we know of Joan comes from eyewitness accounts and the memoirs of those around her. Due to these historical obstacles, writers and cinema directors will always have room for individual interpretation when relating her tale.\n\nIn 1999 \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" was released in theatres as a full length feature film. Director Luc Besson's intention with the film was to accentuate the fact that we cannot prove what her visions were or from whence they came, and in doing so cast doubt on Joan's legend. Unfortunately, while depicting Joan as a schizophrenic, hesitant self doubter, he also made some glaring historical mistakes.\n\nThe first inaccuracy occurs at the very start of the movie. While Joan's village is being sacked by the English, she is hiding in a closet, watching her sister being killed and having her corpse raped. Admittedly, this does assist in creating the image of Joan as a traumatized nut-job, however, her sister was certainly never murdered or raped.\n\nSecondly, the movie fails to accurately present Joan's wound received at Orleans. It makes no mention of her specifically foretelling her being shot with an arrow between her \"left neck and shoulder\", during that specific battle. More importantly, in the movie, Joan passes out from the wound and awakens the next morning. In reality, Joan was treated and returned to rejuvenate and lead the French soldiers in a final attack, which resulted in the victory.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing errors occur during Joan's trial, shortly before her execution. This is the best documented and most historically evident portion of Joan's life. Meticulous minutes were kept recording every spoken word, and most of the trying members wrote notes concerning the atmosphere of the room and Joan's demeanor and reactions to the questions. Joan was given a wooden bench to sit on and always remained fully chained. Throughout the trial, Joan remained courageous and absolutely steadfast in her faith and beliefs, confidently answering fully any questions asked of her, excepting those which she believed God to have forbid her to. In the movie, she is standing, and only chained at the wrists. In addition, she is stuttering and unconfident, not sure of herself. She is shown to not only begin to doubt what she had done and lose faith, it is also intimated that she did kill during the battles, which is untrue.\n\nWhile whether or not the viewer will enjoy this movie is probably based on their beliefs as to whom Joan of Arc was as a person, which is relatively subjective, the historical mistakes are unforgivable. This movie fails to paint an accurate or truthful picture of Joan because of these misconstrued facts, which stem wholly from the creators apparent need to vilify and lay suspicion on her.\n\nThe DVD does get 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was in fact shot well, with decent special effects and good cinematography. Also, Joan of Arc material is limited and for the most part inaccurate, so this movie is just as good as any.", "label": 0}

I guess my objection is with Conroy both with this film, this book and some of his others, like the Great Santini. While he does a great job of honestly describing his horrific childhood experiences, I don't care for his Pollyanna, whitewash type endings. It is essential that we come to terms with our issues but that doesn't necessarily mean giving a mea culpa to those responsible all the time, especially if they are not repentant or own their crimes. The ending line that \"In families, there is no crime that can't be forgiven\" is particularly disturbing. I don't think that's true at all. And I think Conroy's tendency to always wrap things with a Rodney King-like bow, doesn't work very well and ruins the impact of his truly courageous work.

{"text": "The story begins with Beth Cappadora going to her High School Reunion in  Chicago.  For some reason, she brings all her kids and leaves her husband  behind.  However, a tragedy strikes when she leaves the older boy (Vincent)  to watch the younger one (Ben) and he goes missing.  He goes missing for 10  years.\nMuch of the movie involves the consequences of such an action  immediately after the abduction as well as the scars that it leaves even 10  years later.  Vincent, who is not like 17, has become a hardened teen,  partly because of his guilt for letting Ben go and partly because his  mother stopped doing her job as a parent for so many years.  The  wife/husband relationship is also strained but is on the mend as Ben (now  called Sam) comes back into their lives.\nHowever, Ben/Sam is not happy  to be back.  He has been living a quiet, happy life with the only parent he  ever knew, his father.  To be stripped of his father because of something  the now deceased mother did is also a tragedy in itself.  Who are the  parents here?  The Cappadora who raised him to age 3 and are the biological  parents or George Karras who raised Ben/Sam for the remaining 10 years and  is the only parent that Ben/Sam ever knew?\nWell these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.  I felt  this plotline belonged more on \"Growing Pains\" than on the silver  screen.  The worst part of the movie comes at the end when George suddenly  lets Ben/Sam go \"home\" and Ben/Sam suddenly feels that the  Cappadora's are his real family.  This is after Beth lets him go and  Vincent is a real jerk to him.  It is a cop-out ending IMO.\nIf you want  drama, there are others that are better than this formulaic  timewaster....Rating: C-", "label": 0}

{"text": "My daughter was assigned this particular version by her professor, so I watched it, increasingly reluctantly.  The movie was badly made, revolving around the bizarre behavior of an apparently lunatic Joan, played by the director's wife. Incredibly cheesy acting, which is surprising, given the many quality actors and actresses who appear in the movie.\n\nHowever, the main problem with the movie is the thrust of Besson's portrayal of Joan, which goes against the copious first-hand sworn testimony of her neighbors, friends, soldiers, confessors, and acquaintances at Joan's rehabilitation trial after her death. She was known by all to be a sober, steady, stable individual of great self-possession, who inspired great respect, admiration, and deference by all, especially the rough, no-nonsense soldiers who followed her.  Thus, soldiers sent to bring her to the King, intending to throw the peasant girl into a ditch, were won over on the way back to the king with their distrust turned to great respect. And too many other accounts like this to mention here. She won love and admiration by something other than magic tricks--by her character, demeanor, strength, and goodness. That's in the historical record.\n\nThe movie never makes it clear why anyone would have wanted to follow its portrayal of Joan, which inspires revulsion rather than love and admiration. The depiction of Joan's \"Voices\" is especially pejorative and is contradicted by Joan's own recorded words at Poitiers when examined by King Charles' representatives, at the trial of condemnation at Rouen, and the testimony of many witnesses at the rehabilitation trial.  That she was the victim of demented visions is not born out by the actual record. This isn't to claim that what she said is true; simply that the content of what she says she saw and heard are nothing like Besson's fabrications.\n\nMany different interpretations of who Joan of Arc was are possible. But to be remotely honest, they have to respect the basic facts that are right there in the historical record, available to anyone with a minimal effort. Besson did a hatchet job on Joan of Arc, and not a very skilled one at that.  I don't recommend this movie as deserving even casual attention.", "label": 0}

And all the girls, who are mere mortals, and do not have hair & makeup artists, great clothes off a rail which you don't have to pay for, and who are not blessed with such generous ... good looks :) are going green with envy!\n\nOK, so that's my rant over. Considering this is a horror movie, and it's a sequel to a horror movie, you'd think there would be a third too right? Wrong! For some reason, the makers didn't follow the Scream route, and make a trilogy (or the following Scary Movie), but decided to go down the Urban Legend route, and only release two films. When we all know these horror movies are supposed to be trilogies! All great films are trilogies, come on! OK, maybe I'm going OTT.

While it's not a film I would own or dare I say ever really watch again it's a film I'm glad I saw at least once.

Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.

{"text": "The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. \"Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth\" may be a better title.\n\nTonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the \"Spritual Warm-Up\", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular \"stretching\" video.\n\nThe practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.\n\nThe introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to \"Acres 4 Life\" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.\n\nIf you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:\nFull Body Stretch by Karen Voight\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Full-Body-Stretch/dp/B00467182C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Full Body Stretch</a>\n\nCool it Off by Mary Schaefer\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cool-It-Off-Debbie-Siebers-Slim-Series-Stretch-Recovery-Workout-DVD/dp/B000A3XER8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cool It Off - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series: Stretch/Recovery Workout ( DVD)</a>\n\nTotal Body Stretching by Cathe Friedrich\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cathe-Friedrich-s-Total-Body-Stretching-DVD/dp/B000B872PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cathe Friedrich's Total Body Stretching DVD</a>\nand Stretch Max\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-Max-with-Cathe-Friedrich/dp/B001E65A8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch Max with Cathe Friedrich</a>\n\nDeep Stretch with Mimi Solaire\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Deep-Stretch-Yin-Yoga-with-Mimi-Solaire/dp/B001JT6Y8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Deep Stretch/ Yin Yoga with Mimi Solaire</a>\nand Back in Shape\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Back-in-Shape/dp/B0001BRMUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back in Shape</a>\n\nSave Your Lower Back with Annetee Fletcher\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Save-Your-Lower-Back-Release-Strengthen-Stretch-with-Annette-Fletcher/dp/B00097C4B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Save Your Lower Back - Release, Strengthen, Stretch with Annette Fletcher</a>\nand Stretch & Joint Mobility\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-and-Joint-Mobility-Therapy/dp/B00095MBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy</a>\n\nPilates for Flexibility by Amy Brown\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pilates-for-Life-Pilates-for-Flexibility/dp/B000BNKB14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pilates for Life: Pilates for Flexibility</a>", "label": 0}
{"text": "First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series.\n\nNow we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, \"STARS!\" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.\n\nTo be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, \"wait, that didn't happen in the game.\"\n\nThat said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.\n\nAt any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I may be a bit cynical about the film version of a book I so immensely enjoyed reading.  Yet, while the book was a spellbinding page-turner, I found myself squirming through much of the film, especially once Barbra Streisand's nails began taking on a life of their own.  The character she portrays is quite secondary in the book, yet here is a central focus, as could be expected.  That said, Nick Nolte is fantastic in a role that earned an Oscar Nomination, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine throughout.  Also, as a director, Striesand does capture some moments of pure blissful perfection that made this an Oscar worthy best film nominee in 1991.  But, there are crucial elements of prose missing from the plot, and I found myself confused by unncessary devices like therapy sessions that showcase la Streisand in place of the story that needed to be told.  Martin SCorcese would have OWNED this film had he directed it.  Streisand, on the other hand, manages to inspire and cajole, but ultimately falls flat when trying to make sense of the characters.  To be sure, she is one of the few Legends when it comes to filmmaking and acting, but \"The Price Of Tides\" pales by comparison to other noteworthy efforts like \"Yentl.\"  See it for Nolte, and then take the book to bed for an incomparable read!", "label": 2}
{"text": "I thought this movie would be a little better than it was, but, oh well. Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the acting. Have you not seen acting this bad in your life? Also, the movie needs a little more Colin Salmon. He is about the only non-boring character in the movie. Another bad thing is the fact that the whole movie takes place in a weird underground facility. What happened to the glamourous mansion and dilapidated laboratory? The game doesn't take place in some shiny, futuristic complex. Another problem. I guess the good parts of the movie are action sequences when fighting the undead creatures. The zombies also look good, but sometimes the creatures look like unscary crap! Who likes that? Take a look at the version of the Licker and you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some very well done jump scenes, such as with the man being attacked by his sister. But others are deliberately there, trying to be suspenseful. Then, after you freak slightly, it turns out to be nothing at all! The movie was well-done, but too short, sometimes boring, and untrue to the game. Overall, if you like zombie movies or Resident Evil, you might wanna check this movie out. If you don't like zombies or RE, stay far, far away!", "label": 2}

{"text": "This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  \"Hollywoodized\" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

{"text": "Whats good about alot of these Christmas DVD's that have come out in the last few years is that they present the specials in their original form. One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.\n\nI watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.\n\nBut there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.\n\nIt is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.\n\nBut thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials. I'm a kid of the eighties. I have no real recollection of what the sixties/seventies were all about but I like the style. For you peeps out there that do remember, you should appreciate the uncut renditions of these specials found on DVD.

{"text": "In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.\n\nWarner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)\n\nThe loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.\n\nOn the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.\n\nSadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.\n\nThere's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.\n\nNot much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.", "label": 2}

This version of Jane Eyre probably would have been more appealing for me had I not read the book for the third time when I rented this movie.  I have also seen the Orson Welles version but being that I am not a Welles fan I could not over look the man for the character.  The Timothy Dalton version was somewhat better for me since more of the story was put in the movie and then the Hinds version was most disappointing mainly because so much story line was left out and alterations were made.

My advice would be to rent several versions before purchasing, especially if you read the book first.  I had set in my mind the perfect Jane and Mr. Rochester and doubt that I will ever find them in a movie adaptation.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Yes, I do like art films, non-mainstream films, thought-provoking films - and for those who are still wondering, I am no fan of action or classic hollywood formulas etc. Thus what I have to say is not based on any heartbreak over lack of action or cheesy romance or a simple linear storyline.\n\nNo, the real problem is that this movie takes on a number of contemporary topics (such as homelessness, urban isolation, depression, existential ennui, inflammatory talk-radio, ... yes the list is lo..ng) mixes them up with a dash of (obviously labored) enigma and a generous serving of shock-value items (violence, language, nudity, meaningless scenes - Robin Williams obliges competently here) and serves them up with the suggestive lure of slightly non-traditional cinematography (odd angles and extreme close-ups of faces, lips - also overdone) - with the hope that perhaps the pseudo-artsy segment will fall for these gimmicks (and forget that there is really no depth, no original thoughts or insights whatsoever) and hail it as another great, maverick production. (And judging from the nominations, the ploy worked!)\n\nYes, I like Robin Williams and that is why I fell for it - yet that couldn't alter a fundamentally flawed movie that's trying to exploit our interest in these \"deeper human topics/issues\". Great acting (even if I were to concede that) cannot cover-up for a pointless, phony script.\n\nIn summary, DO NOT waste your money (and more importantly TIME) on this one - even if you can see it for free!\n\nRegards all.\n\nP.S.  There is a difference between being creative/unconventional for the benefit of gaining unique perspectives leading to new connections/insights - and being \"creative/zany\" for the sake of it i.e. to get attention and fuel our narcissism.

{"text": "I have had an interest in the story about Joan of Arc ever since I learned about her in 6th grade history, so when I found out they made a movie about her, I wanted to see it. Sadly the movie is highly inaccurate to the story about the young French warrior maiden who saved her country. They start off with her childhood (might I add she was 13 when she first heard her voices, not 7 or 8 like the movie seems to think) where she watches the murder and rape of her sister. Joan did have a sister, a younger sister not one who was between the ages 16-18. While I think that Milla Jovovich is a tallented actress she wasn't right for the role in this movie, she made Joan of Arc seem like a lunatic. To make things worse her voices seem very satanic. If you want my advice avoid this movie and watch the Joan of Arc movie with Leelee Sobieski, it is very intertaining and has a more realistic view of Joan.", "label": 0}

I grew up playing quite a few flight simulators on computers, and this added to my fantasy of someday flying a fighter jet. This is exactly what this movie's about, a kid completely enthralled with flight simulations that he becomes a good pilot.\nThey should have left it at that though. The kid's fantasy of rescuing his dad (also a pilot) from some mysterious middle eastern base should not have been brought to reality. Reality should not have extended past his races in his single-engine crop-duster with a motorcycle. Throughout the movie, the kid does not see the world as a dangerous place. He still sees it as one big simulation. This is exactly how you should watch the movie, otherwise, it will seem like a ridiculous plot that's out-of-touch with the real world.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The best thing about this movie is that its not much different than the Christmas Carols that came before it.\n\nSeriously, the setting is changed, its moved to a small New England town during the Great Depression. This is the perefect setting, the time and place are quite reminiscent of Dickens' London, so you don't have the distraction from making major changes. Aside from the setting, you have a fairly typical Christmas Carol. Sure, Henry Winkler's Benedict Slade doesn't go around saying bah humbug, nor does he have a nephew, but he's no different than Ebeneezer Scrooge. Nor is he a boy growing up in a boarding school (tyical for England at the time) hated by his father for his mother dying in childbirth, instead he's an orphan. Same impact, but appropriate for the time and place.\n\nAs a TV movie, its a bit lacking compared to other versions, the budget is more visible than typical, but wise use of settings and lesser TV actors help. While many of the supporting cast are familiar, none are stars of any sort, just standard supporting actors. The play like use of three of Slade's debtors to represent the three spirits works very well, giving their parts more weight and saving the production money, ditto for the reuse of sets when they're not outside. The ghost of Christmas future is the greatest departure from the original, after all, in this movie he can talk, and we actually see what he looks like. And his very dated arrival is a bit funnier than was intended, but that journey still carries weight.\n\nOver all, well done and believable without significantly rewriting a classic. I recommend this as the best of the alternates for those who like a bit of variety without a complete rewrite of the story.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Since this movie seems to inspire nothing but praise in this forum, I thought I'd toss out an opinion against the current. I think people of faith ought to be warned against this movie. It is the kind of movie that religious people are naturally drawn to. It deals with the brokenness and failure in human relationships, and it has some religious themes, or I should say, the author clearly *thinks* that he is making an artistic commentary on spiritual themes. He portrays the father of the protagonists, who is a pastor, to be a 2-dimensional pharisee, full of reflex prejudices and social conformisms. There is nothing redeeming about the father. He is just a caricature that, no doubt, reflects author's resentment of the inadequacies of the faith of his own parents. In fact, the movie is really only \"spiritual\" in so far as it provides a nice portrait of how liberals view religious people, on the one hand, and depicts the spiritual impotence of faithless people on the other. The sentimentality in this movie is mind-numbing. Once again, this reflects the author's idea of the essence of the religious belief he has personally left behind. It reminds me of a movie Jane Fonda made some years ago called Golden Pond - a movie full of anti-family, anti-religious hatreds, with a veneer of sentimentality that is supposed to disarm religious people, because after all, isn't sentimentality what religion is all about? But this is by no means the most repugnant aspect of this film. This is a film full of despair, written by someone who is powerless to heal a hangnail, much less a serious spiritual disfunction, precisely because the power of living faith is completely alien to him. Obviously, tragedy and self-destructive behavior occur in families of faith, but art is like quantum measurement: it necessarily distorts what it measures, and the more explicit the ideological message, the bigger the distortion. Misery likes company, and this film is simply an invitation to the shared misery of a cynical, sorrowful, spiritually impotent liberal living in a post christian culture. There is absolutely nothing edifying or liberating in the entire film, unless you think bitter self-pity is liberating. Secularists of the sentimental sort might enjoy this opportunity to wallow in their own heartache, and outdoorsmen might enjoy the scenary. People of faith should just pass this one up. Pretty scenary does not give mystical meaning to stupid despair, nor does it vindicate it. If you are a person of faith, save your dollars for a movie created by someone who knows what faith really is. And Please don't give your money to these despairing clowns who are wise in their own eyes. They will only use it to make more vapid movies.", "label": 0}

I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing. Also I thought that the scene with Jane and Rochester meeting Blanche while on the way to shopping was useless. However, if you are not familiar with the novel or other adaptations you might like this one. It's basically poor governess falling in love with a master of the house. I gave it 3 stars because of the beautiful scenery, costumes, and settings, and also I thought that Jane and Rochester's age difference was more appropriately portrayed than in other versions. If you're not familiar with Jane Eyre story, I would recommend that you pick up the book or watch Dalton/Clarke version (it's most faithful to the novel) before watching this movie.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.", "label": 0}

His emasculated, simpering deadpan, dispensing dialogue medicinally as so much cough syrup, completely fails to engage as a romantic figure. The notion of Michelle's ravishing, vivacious character head over heels for him is more than a stretch. I've seen gunfighters with more chemistry than these two. Their first intimate scene, eek!

For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.", "label": 2}

If you want to check out some disturbing prison flicks I recommend Scum and Scrubbers.  The film starts of well and tense but then loses all pace and feels as real as a TVM.  Billy Hayes was a drug smuggler simple as that.  I'm sure his time in prison was quite uneventful as the tongue biting scene was totally out of character but one of the rare highlights in this throughly dull movie.  We got his long drawn out build up to the escape and when it happened everything was over in 10 minutes. I also did not see any caucasian Turkish prison guards with 5 days growth and long straggy hair but he managed to fool the twenty guards he walked past. I think the director had reached breaking point as well. Talk about a cheap ending various photographs of family members meeting him at the airport they must have run out of money.

Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade.

{"text": "This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: \"Outstanding Miniseries.\" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular \"Bible Collection\" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as \"proof.\" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish", "label": 1}
{"text": "Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you.

Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer.

{"text": "Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:\n\nWhat a LOAD!\n\nTell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.\n\nI swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.\n\nY'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.\n\nThe ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.\n\nIt is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the \"R\" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.\n\nAll the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of \"Aw, man, I really liked him/her too\".\n\nNow, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.\n\nThe zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say \"Oh yeah, they're here too\". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, \"Holy crap, they're screwed\".\n\nNot necessarily so, Lois.\n\nInstead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).\n\nNaturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our \"Zombie Reminders\" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.\n\nOkay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.\n\nThen there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.\n\nAll of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.\n\nVery Little.", "label": 0}

Then it goes immediately back to focusing on Joseph.  God's written word is obviously trying to make a point and show a comparison.  The movie grabbed even the smallest details from the scriptures; for example the stranger in the desert that suddenly asks Joseph who he's looking.\n\nI purchased a used movie that was in SUPER, Good, like NEW shape and to boot, the movie was inspiring, educational and so real.\n\nIt's a must see .........", "label": 1}

{"text": "I love resident evil, and the first movie is one of my favorites.\n\nThis movie was such a huge let down. First off the Directing was horrid. The action sequences scream of low quality. The director uses quick jagged camera movements to obscure the action in the movie and give the moive a \"sense\" of action, but people who are used to the matrix/jackie chane show whats going on aspects of a fight sequnce will be aggrivated with the final show down.\n\nOntop of that the movie down right STEALS from the various RE stroy lines. and re-writes resident evil 3 completly,.\n\nI much rather have had a RE type story or one that could have ran parrel much like the first movie. In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning. If it wasn't a complete rip off (say if the character was the same) it wouldn't have been so glaringly bad, but when you go to see a movie you go to see \"new\" thoughts and ideas not just shifted image stolen from video games with different characters doing things that run logically against the game that the images are being stolen from.\n\nAn ok movie for people who have never played the game..\n\nBut the action super hero twist and rip-off only serve to tarnish the fact that its supposed to be a \"resident evil\" movie. The director probably should have looked at some of the movies that RE borrwed from before he went about trying to turn this into a horrible wanna be super hero flick", "label": 0}

{"text": "The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.\n\nIn this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in \"Wives and Daughters\", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version\n\nThe 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.\n\nThe book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: \"Oliver Twist\" 1839, \"A Christmas Carol\" 1843, and \"David Copperfield\" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story \"Great Expectations\" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of \"Great Expectations\" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.\n\nCharles Dickens's book \"Oliver Twist\" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The \"Oliver Twist\" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play \"Oliver Twist\"; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story \"Great Expectations\" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Zombies and guns. Trapped. Zombies and guns. Running. Zombies and guns... It may sound like B-grade, popcorn, adolescent male fodder, but Resident Evil is actually a well-crafted movie of the survival-horror genre. Eschewing gore in favor of imagination, it skimps on the on-screen bloodbath, and instead plays a guessing game that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.\nThe scenario is that in the ultra secret military lab of the Umbrella Corporation, an extremely volatile virus has been set loose. The alarm is triggered, and the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence system, quarantines \"the hive\" to prevent the virus from reaching Raccoon City, trapping the workers in the process.\nIn an effort to save the survivors and salvage the research, a team of commandoes is sent in to reboot the Red Queen, before she seals the Hive permanently. A simple objective, but one immediately complicated by the discovery of our protagonist, Alice, a young woman suffering from amnesia. She has no memory, but the Team Lead recognizes her as an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, so she is taken into the hive with them.\nWhat she finds there makes her doubt that she wants her memory back.\nIt may sound like overdone tripe, but Resident Evil (RE) takes some of the old horror cliches and makes them new again. Alice's memory loss is handled with intelligence, and enough mystery to keep the viewer guessing. The gore is minimal, as the film culls its scares from sound cues and implication rather than onscreen blood. Unlike so many other horror movies, it doesn't have gaping holes in it's plot (though there are a couple of lapses in continuity). Instead it cleverly weaves it's elements, slowly revealing how everything came to pass as it heads towards it climax. The coup de grace though, is the action. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez put the \"grrr!\" in \"girl.\" Wallflowers won't survive in the Hive, and these two ladies are intent on living. When the ammo's gone, they resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.\nI won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares. But for those that love a good action movie, pop a bag of popcorn, and make yourself comfy on the couch. You're in for a hell of a thrill ride. And when the movie's done, check out the special features. The 2-disc Collector's Edition coming later this year will have the lion's share, but the Special Edition is no slouch. There are several \"Making of\" featurettes, a music video by Slipnot, and a commentary track featuring the principal actors and the director. Definitely worth your dollar.", "label": 2}
{"text": "IDLE HANDS has more misses than hits, but one can't help but find the overall movie amusing.  Devon Sawa does a very good job with his possessed hand, some have already mentioned it's likeness to Steve Martin in ALL OF ME.  Bringing back his friends (Seth Green, Elden Henson) as zombies is a direct ripoff from both American Werewolf movies, and even though derivative as such, are buoyant and fun.  Viveca Fox as the hand hunter is hilarious, as is Jack Noseworthy as the pseudo-studly Randy.  There is lots of gore, pot smoking, even nutmeg/oregano smoking, but in this day and age, what teen movie wouldn't have it.  The overuse of soundtrack songs is as always distracting, but again, when one targets a teen audience, this is what one gets.  However, the musical score itself by Graeme Revell is very good.

{"text": "I saw this film once and once was enough. As a secular free-thinker but  Catholic as a child I was taught Jeanne was a saint. Even now, she remains a puzzlement. ntil lately, I could find no objective books about her until I found a book by Frances Gies and other sensible historians (not dramatists) who presented this heroine in a most objective and respectful historical account. Hero tough, unshakeable faith in what she believed  caused her to go to crown Charles the dauphin as Charles VII of France, and to accomplish this she will have to lead an army and raise the siege of--and defeat the English in--Orleans. On that pathway she carried a banner and inspired thousands by proving herself. The film title Messenger does not suit her; more likely it should have been titled The Battle Within. If Jeanne had behaved in real life as she did in the film she would never been put at the head of an army--in fact Robert de Baudricourt would never have outfitted her to go to war but sent her home under guard. Milla Jovovich did a great job of playing a hysterical schizophrenic, not Jeanne D'Arc.\n\nIn the 1400s medieval males, essentially the English army, believed women who were with soldiers were prostitutes. In most of the films about her she was were portrayed, (though erring on the side of religious mysticism)  her as someone with, along with excessive piety, still had some common sense, a very loving, confident, and brave girl (she begins her \"assignment\" at age 17) with no riding or battle experience, is illiterate, and of the people, she never forgets the goal, in short, a believable leader. In The Messenger if it was meant to be analytical they miss the mark by a mile. She is portrayed as a hypertensive, hysterical, half scared Jeanne who, when finally realizing she is doomed to a horrid death, sees her \"conscience\" or some Guy in Black, come into her cell and tell her in effect that she got the wrong message and the joke is on her. As other reviewers who share my disappointment in this film have stolen my thunder and I applaud them for it, I will not repeat what is already intelligently opined.\n\nBut when I saw Dustin Hoffman come barging into her already doomed condition, playing what seemed a Bad Guy, or a spoiler,the \"devil\" or god or a conscience, some unnecessary addition, it really made me shake my head. Years later, after reading the IMDB-presented dialogue  between Jeanne and Hoffman on line, telling her she never heard anything she didn't want to hear, I was plain disgusted. Sure, Hoffman was a good actor in a cameo role and can do no wrong EXCEPT agree to appear as this creepy guy who symbolizes something sinister. Well, I knew why I had stopped watching the movie: because at is precisely where it should have ended  Because that would have added everything up just fine. We all know from history the trial was rigged and that she was burned at the stake: her decision to resume male attire was her downfall--she was attacked by guards when she wore women's dress designated h er as relapsed. She was a true innocent in real life and did what she believed and was portrayed woefully wrongly. What a shame, they got Jeanne all wrong for the sake of titillating entertainment.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I was so upset after watching this film, I had to write a review somewhere to caution people not to watch it.  The old silent version is the best I've ever seen of St. Joan, and the other '90s version with Leelee Sobieski did a much better job of showing St. Joan's human struggles as a young girl responding to the call of the divine, but used by and eventually abandoned by earthly powers.\nOkay, here are my issues with this depiction of the saint's life:\n\n1) The rape scene she witnessed with her sister.  This appears nowhere in the stories of her life.  Yes, we have very little hard facts to go by, but this fabrication made it look like Joan was motivated by revenge for her sister's murder and rape, rather than a holy calling.  The rest of the film for the most part supports this view (Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of her \"Conscience,\" for instance).\n2) The scenes where, after her sister's funeral, Joan refuses to make the sign of the cross, and then removes a chalice of wine from the church's tabernacle, makes the motions of consecrating it, and then pours it down her throat after shouting \"I want to be with you NOW!\"  There are two ways you could understand this behavior:  From a secular perspective, she totally lost grasp of reality after her sister's death.  From a faith perspective, this is complete heresy, not to mention silly misrepresentation of Catholic communion.  There would never have been a chalice of precious blood in the tabernacle (only the Eucharist, the hosts that have been consecrated at mass).  If someone ever performed any behavior like this, they would never be canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Period.\n3) The trippy scenes of her visions, where she encounters a slightly creepy Christ figure, and not St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael the Archangel.  I don't even know where to start with Dustin Hoffman's character.  When I first saw him, I thought he was depicting Satan tormenting her in prison (his behavior certainly seemed more in-line with this analysis, although the credits list him as her \"Conscience\").  Then at the end, he hears her confession and then absolves her of her sin!  We know St. Joan was confessed (by an actual human priest) and received the Eucharist, because we have the priest's testimony.  Another inaccuracy:  They show her finding her sword in a field, and her \"Conscience\" has her consider all the possible ways that what she interpreted as a sign from God could actually have been just random chance.  While it is good to be cautious with interpreting signs, and should be discerned under the guidance of a trusted spiritual director, it is one of the basic elements of her biography that she found her sword in a chapel (I believe it was under a statue of St. Catherine).\n5)Her death scene, where she is screaming as she burns at the stake, while some random person in the crowd waves a cross about, is very disturbing.  Yes the reality of someone being burned to death at the stake is pretty unnerving, but there seems to be something almost mocking about the cross, and her behavior looks more like despair than holy resignation (I know, I could never muster holy resignation while being burned... which is why I'm not a saint).  In her biography, St. Joan asked that someone lift up the cross that she might see it as she died, and her last word as she burned was \"Jesus.\"\n\nThere were a few good moments in this movie.  I like that they show her repeatedly insisting that the army sends messages asking for the surrender of the English.  I like the scene where she rides across the field of battle to do this, prays for an end to bloodshed, and then the English turn away without fighting.  I like how they depicted her discovering the Dauphin in disguise.  But for the most part they made her seem like a raving lunatic.  It was a patronizing film told like the perspective of someone who does not believe in miracles, taking what I will admit is one of the more bizarre and mystifying saints' lives, and looking down on the ignorant peasant girl with a bit of spirit who got a little too much religion which made her an easy pawn for the political powers of her day.  Read the transcripts from her trial and you see a clever and faith-filled woman who is clearly grounded in reality.  This film is a gross oversimplification to the point of obfuscation of the real story of an incredible saint.", "label": 0}

Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S.

Ugh!\n\nFor some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.\n\nA newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.\n\nI don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.\n\nThere's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off \"her\" head - the medic in the laser hallway.\n\nWith a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!\n\nThe extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.\n\nThis is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.", "label": 2}

This is a love story with plenty of treakle but more than an ounce of vinegar as Tom and Lowenstein hit things off, become lovers, but ultimately part company forever to resolve their differences with their respective spouses.\nColumbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of \"The Awful Truth\" or \"Talk of the Town\".

No matter what movie forum you visit you will always see this film averaging around five stars, and (in my opinion) it just doesn't warrant that level of praise. This is just a theory, but I have a suspicion that old movies that have been deemed \"classics\" get a much more benevolent treatment when it comes to reviews. Perhaps this may be due to nostalgia. I'm not bashing old movies in general. In fact, many old movies appear on my Top 100 Films list (Billy Budd, Fail Safe, Psycho, Ben Hur, It's A Wonderful Life, Zorba The Greek, The Virgin Spring, etc.) But like the vast majority of older movies, this film has acting that is way over the top (overacting) and dialog that is totally cornball. Some may rightly enjoy this campiness. I don't. Another distracting thing about this film is that there are plot sequences (particularly relating to their trek with the explosives cargo) that were simply illogical and seemed to be capriciously thrown in so as to create a foundation for a thrill/action scene. The films cinematography and art direction are wonderful and that's what will stand out in my memory of this film.

{"text": "This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!\n\nIt all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.\n\nBut then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.\n\nDon't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.\n\nMorton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.\n\nIn the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!\n\nThere are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to \"The governess,\"while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!\n\nThe second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.\n\nIn the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:\n\n\"So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?\" sneers Rochester.\n\n\"I found someone who wanted to marry me.\" again, the self-satisfied smile.\n\nGood lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.\n\nAs we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.\n\nThe story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.\n\nAs for the \"scares\", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's \"jumps\"(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).\n\nThe performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across. Rent it for your date and see if they'll get scared but you'll probably be creeped out less than the date, if they get freaked out at all.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I will be 33 in January 2002. I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.\nThis was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it. It's not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras.\n\nThis is because while \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five.\n\nLet's start with the movie and some background on its history.\n\nFirst, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.\n\nIt's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. \"Super Mario Brothers\"? Awful. Van Damme's \"Streetfighter\"? Mediocre at best. \"House of the Dead\"? Dumb.\n\nWhich is why when \"Resident Evil\" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, \"Resident Evil\" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.\n\nIt also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with \"28 Days Later,\" the new \"Dawn of the Dead,\" and the Brit comedy \"Shaun of the Dead.\"\n\nThat trend continues now with \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse,\" which picks up right where the first film ended.\n\nThe bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.\n\nReturning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the \"Resident Evil\" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.\n\nOther game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.\n\nPart of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(\"Mortal Kombat\", \"Aliens Vs. Predator\"). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.\n\nAnderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.\n\nI'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:\n\nPoor attention to characters - Though \"Resident Evil\" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.\n\nNot enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.\n\nMike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the \"Friday\" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the same tired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.\n\nAt least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.\n\nNow for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink.\n\nMost interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.  Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think.\n\nI also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them.\n\nWhile this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like \"28 Days Later\" and the new \"Dawn of the Dead\" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  \"Resident Evil:Apocalyse\" just didn't quite meet that challenge.\n\nOne thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in \"Resident Evil 3.\" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I decided to intentionally not watch this movie on the big screen, after hearing reviews from several people. I then wasn't sure if I wanted see the movie at all, but I broke down and rented it anyway, as I am a big fan of Joan of Arc.\nFrom the moment I read about her sister's rape on the cover, I knew I'd have a difficult time watching this movie, since that event never happened.  After watching the whole thing, I found that my initial impressions were correct.  This movie was just a movie, _not_ a historical documentary, which is something to definitely keep in mind.  It would've been nice if Besson had referenced the trial transcripts for a better idea of how Joan actually lived, but alas.\nI (generously) give a rating of one star, only because this work has spread a little more awareness of the life and death of Joan of Arc.  I would also give this movie two enthusiastic thumbs down, except for the battle scenes, and Besson didn't even get all of those right, so a somewhat shaky one thumb up for the battle scenes. The reason for this rating is quite simple - Monty Python and the Holy Grail was much more historically accurate than easily at least half of this hellishly awful piece-of-... movie that rotted sea monkeys could've done better with.  It's much more entertaining, as well.\nThe beginning did not impress me at all.  I found the scrolling white text to be rather small, and I had to pause to read what was trying to be conveyed.  Also, Joan did not find her sword as it was portrayed in this movie.  (Why a small shepherdess would need a huge sword to tend sheep is still beyond me.)  I didn't really care for the hooked-on-drugs vision in the forest, either.\nThe scene in which Joan's sister was raped may have been appropriate if the event had actually happened.  I found it to be distasteful, especially as there were so many things in Joan's life that Besson could have chosen to emphasize.  The invention of a falsity to \"enhance\" an already miraculous story just strikes me as ridiculous.\nThe scene where Joan rushes in to drink from the communion chalice is not accurate at all.  Speaking as a Catholic liturgist, the Blood of Christ (communion wine after consecration) was and still is never stored in the tabernacle (where the extra consecrated bread goes after communion), which would have been locked anyway.  Joan also would not have had access to drinking the wine to begin with.  She was not full of manufactured rage, as Besson would like us to think.  Lisa Simpson from television's \"The Simpsons\" was more accurately portrayed, as far as young Joans go.  \"Who, me?  But I'm just a little girl!\"\nJoan also never said anything about God being angry with the English... the trial records clearly state that she didn't know if God was against the English, but he wanted them out of France.  The scene with the arrow in her chest was very touching, but she went straight back to the battle, and the battle was won that same day, NOT the next day as shown.  The more exciting storyline in this section lies in actual fact - how amazing!\nI do like how Milla plays Jehanne, except for the unnecessary hysterics.  (I liked Milla in \"The Fifth Element\" and in \"Zoolander\", too.)  I also liked the concept of Dustin Hoffman's role.  This was a nice spin on things, along with the symbolic meaning of Joan's hair turning from lightness to darkness through the course of the movie.  I also liked how John Malkovich played Charles, and appreciated that Besson was accurate in the \"Find the Dauphin\" game.\nHistory records Joan wearing male clothing during the trial, and with her head shaved for the burning.  The miter Joan wore on \"stake day\" was noticeably absent.  A cross was not held up as Joan's body burned; it was a crucifix (amazing what difference a little body makes).\nI am now wondering about how many other things I've missed, since I was too bewildered at Besson's storytelling approach to write most of my thoughts down.  Factual accuracy aside, this movie could have been made into so much more.  It's highly disappointing, yet somewhat pretty to look at if you aren't aware of \"the real story\".\nBleaach.  See \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" by Carl Dreyer instead!  At least that made Ebert's top 100 great movies list.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.\n\nAnyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are won't to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.\n\nTo give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)\n\nPerformances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.\n\nAs if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.\n\nAlso, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.\n\nGrade: C", "label": 2}
{"text": "I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.", "label": 1}

He does a good job as the author here, but the biases of the book are repeated and there are some overly sharp portraits drawn, especially of Fischer, who comes off as more of a jerk than in the book.

After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.\n\nClose Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking \"is that it, after all that slow build-up?\".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.\n\nI have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.\n\nThe second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.

{"text": "It's been six years since I have run out of a movie theater angry and bewildered.\nThis review is really intended for the mature movie-goer. I say this because many of the young adults loved this movie and were having a blast.  I only wish I could have seen what they found so interesting. But hey, I gave it a go.  Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating.\nIf you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original \"Night of the Living Dead\"). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.\n  There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick.\nI give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead. I enjoy her acting, she is blossoming into a great actress.  In all, this movie felt like a combination of \"Aliens\", \"Ghosts of Mars\", \"Return of the Living Dead\", and \"Relic\".  It's a mish-mash of many great film ideas...but the ridiculous zombies were the movie's downfall. If they were more realistic, and frightening, instead of laughable, the movie might have succeeded.", "label": 0}

While the next two programs improve on this, other DVDs such as \"The Third Reich in Color\" have presented color European theatre and Third Reich footage more carefully. However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.\nThe color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc. Pacific theatre buffs will feel shortchanged; I'd say 80 to 85% of the material concerns Europe. This DVD set is certainly worthwhile if you wish to see a large quantity of period color footage with informative commentary. It succeeds in bringing the war and the period to life.", "label": 2}

{"text": "In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement. Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day. Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge. Strange events begin to happen and people start dying. No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop. It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.\n\nI watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night. Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night. Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep. Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).\n\nHowever, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time. I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me. I just didn't find the movie very scary. Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie. Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say \"it's garbage\".\n\nThere are many who will find the movie quite frightening. Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive. The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too. Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Twenty years ago, a movie like \"Resident Evil\" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's \"Thirteen Ghosts\" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality.\nThe film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them.\nEnter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more.\nThe underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown.\nThe real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber.\n... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares.\nOn those grounds, \"Resident Evil\" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I recently re-viewed Taxi Driver to see if it might make a better impression than 30 years ago.  It didn't.  Scorcese's confounding lack of character development, a gratuitous and underdeveloped plot, grimy violence, and lurid musical score contribute to a sludgy mess that gained accolades over the years primarily due to its cutting edge approach to the subject matter.  Well, it's no longer 1976, and the decades gone by have not been kind to the film.\n\nTruly great films transcend the times in which they were made, and Taxi Driver, with its mannered and one dimensional performances, suffers from a lack of emotional credibility.  We never witness Bickle's motivations or demons, instead viewing him as a two dimensional, socially inept caricature who can't handle male-female interaction. Then, almost spontaneously he obsesses on making a violent \"big statement\".  The dialog and plotting provides little insight into this tormented man's inner voices- Is he suffering PTSD? Is he the product of a terrible home situation? Where do the violent and anti-social tendencies come from? What are Bickle's primary motivations?\n\nI'm incredulous as to how Taxi Driver has sustained its aura after all these years when it basically plays out like a low budget, violent melodrama with a tawdry and frankly unbelievable conclusion. If it wasn't for Jodie Foster's amazing portrayal of the world weary teenage prostitute, there'd be little reason to watch the film other than for curiosity's sake.", "label": 0}
{"text": "My biggest annoyance with this movie is the fact that it has almost nothing to do with the original video game.  The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.

{"text": "For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.\n\nThe scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.\n\nIn a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.\n\nWinkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.", "label": 2}

Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.\n\nThe movie is so fake it's sad.

Well I have and FYI they were a lot more clever than this trash. I just don't see that this movie took any cues from the comic nor is it even as well written!! The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes!

{"text": "For such a historical figure, I expected a bit more coming into the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie simply because of the story, the action, and the time-period.  Unfortunately, however, Joan of Arc - the catalyst for legendary events in French history, the end of a war, and the first person anyone thinks of when there is even the slightest mentioning of burning at the stake - really deserves more.\n\nFirst, the positive aspects of this movie probably outweigh the bad.  The scenery, style, and medieval genre is represented well.  The film has a very powerful feel, and properly displays how thoughts, beliefs, and energy can be controlled and swayed by the power of religion.  Such greatness has been accomplished through religion, but this film also shows the gritty realism of widespread death that has been brought about from religious intolerance.\n\nThe bad, however, is two-fold: acting and influence.\n\nJoan of Arc was probably not a hyperventilating, over-reacting, deranged, incompetent military leader.  If I were French I would hate this movie.  It basically paints Joan of Arc as a vindictive, revenge-driven, screaming harpy.  The fact that Milla Jovavich seems to have read an \"Acting for Dummies\" book written by Jim Carey - where facial contortions and eyeball bulging trump conveyance of emotion through acting - definitely didn't help either.\n\nWhereas Joan of Arc was tried for heresy, to me the people who made this movie should be charged with something similar.  There is nearly no mention of Joan's military prowess, her benevolence, or her true religious devotion.  The fact that there is almost an insinuation that she was speaking to the devil, rather than Jesus, is almost blasphemous.\n\nThere's also the character I like to call \"Creepy Jesus\".  It's almost as if everyone involved really wanted to show religion as an ugly part of humanity, the possibility of visions being realistic or divine, or that there is inherent value in religion.  There could not have been a weirder actor chosen for the character of Jesus, and there surely couldn't have been a more negative portrayal of religion.\n\nThe Messenger covers most of the historical details decent enough, entertains the audience quite well, but it's just painfully obvious that the director was interested in psychoanalysis of Joan, her actions, her visions, and religion in general.", "label": 2}

The whole production is dark, lots of crashing special effects, derring do, conflict between \"Father\" and \"Mother\" which is never explained.

{"text": "I am a Resident Evil fan of the GAMES and as such, I have come to expect a certain...depth to my RE experience.  In the game, Zombies are the result of science gone wrong and, as a survivor of science gone wrong, your on screen avatar is expected to get to the bottom of it all.  In the first movie Resident Evil, much of this tone came through wonderfully.  Although there was plenty of shooting and running, the characters had to use intelligence to defeat the Red Queen defense computer and the genetically enhanced licker.  Alice was just a normal, albiet well trained, woman who finds herself in a horrible situation.  Thats Resident Evil to the tee.  So one can imagine my suprise and dismay when Resident Evil Apocalypse had none of this...\n\nRE 2 manages to take a basically puzzle based psychological theme and turns it into a totally mediocre action film with all the overly done cliches and pointlessly unrealistic sequences.  Alice is no longer well trained, she's a \"super being\" with \"amazing powers\" of various forms.  True, even in the games this is not untrod ground but in the games the \"SPB's\" or super powered beings were the bad guys, forcing the all to human heroes to overcome their amazing powers.  The David to Goliath theme is a time tested and wonderful one that fits Re like a glove.  Why the writers chose to leave it behind is beyond me.\n\nIn this movie, one will see way too many obvious deaths and plot twists.  There are at least 6 instances of characters firing at a zombie just behind a human for the \"oh wow you saved me while looking like you were going to kill me\" effect.  There are also humerous instances of the \"suprise attack\" by zombies that seem to leap out of the framework to fall upon unsuspecting characters.  Added to the mix came main characters with such amazing pistol skills that they can hit a zombie in the head every time.  Ever since Mission Impossible Two directors have thought this is something audiences want to see but I for one am getting VERY tired of it.\n\nBut the absolute worst thing about this movie is the irreverant use of the Resident Evil characters in the game without any thought to who or what they are.  It is painfully obvious that the director chose to use Jill Valentine from RE 1 and 3 the game because she is a woman and can \"sex the screen up.\"  Her intro to the movie has her walking into a police station and shooting zombies in the head without any explination of how she knows to do this or why she seems to be in trouble.  Sure, there is a bit of allusion to her disgrace but no explination.  Well folks...here it is.  Jill was part of the elite STARS unit that responded to a dusturbance at the Umbrella mansion and were nearly wiped out by the unleashed zombies.  When they tried to return with their story, Umbrella supressed it and made sure the STARS were disbanded.  When Racoon City slides into anarchy, Nemesis is unleashed to remove the surviving STARS as witnesses to Umbrella's complicity.  Now why could't they have had a montage in the movie with all that!  I, for one, would have enjoyed it more than the questionable action scenes and thin plot.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').\n\nInstead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.\n\nThe differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \"true story\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\" and, \"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\"", "label": 0}

Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....\n\nThe story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.\n\nWhat follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!\n\nThe cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.\n\nAll in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking \"Father\", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.\n\nWhile it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!!

The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film.

I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.\n\nJack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.\n\nOtherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.\n\nInspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.\n\nUpdated 29 May 2011:\n\nAs Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Watch this one and then watch the silent 1928 Passion of Joan of Arc. It's the difference between a comic book and Les Miserables. I've seen most of the Joan films except the one with Ingrid Bergman, which I haven't been able to find. I'm not an expert on the historical Joan, but I can compare films. The Joan films have been good, bad, and indifferent. The silent film is beyond compare. This one falls somewhere between bad and indifferent. Someone else mentioned the mix of accents. It drove me crazy. Most of the French army sounded more English than the English and Joan sounded like she was from Illinois. I also get extremely annoyed with historically based films that feel compelled to dumb down the dialogue by salting the dialogue with contemporary-usage obscenities and vulgarities. As a historical novelist myself, one of the things I research meticulously is the slang of the period. Nothing pulls you out of a historical moment like a 20th century slang coming form a long-ago character. I guess ultimately I have to say it's an ok movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend money on it. If you want to buy a Joan film, opt for the 1928 silent. The added orchestral score is wonderful. The acting will break your heart. This one *shrug*\n\nRuth Sims", "label": 0}

{"text": "I watched the original series with MacNee and Rigg (and even caught Honor Blackman in it). It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series.\nI'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.\nThe time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.\nStill, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.\nFiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.\nConnery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series.

Some aspects of the 60's have held up well (Jimi Hendrix still sounds great), but this movie isn't one of them.  If you can listen to Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper babble with the other stoners on the commune about doing your own thing in your own time without bursting out laughing, you need more drugs.

My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but  it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an  endless supply of mythology for devotees of \"Star Wars,\" and this  movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the  so-called \"inspiration\" shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and  Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones  stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at  any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what  I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the  movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still  new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways.

The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.\nThis is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film.

Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.\n\nWith more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.

{"text": "I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's \"Sweet and Lowdown\", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.\n\n2.5/5", "label": 0}

There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail.

It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.  Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is \"does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?\". This movie does not.", "label": 0}

{"text": "\"The Prince of Tides\" is my favorite novel.  This movie has very little to do with the book.\n\nTaking this story out of South Carolina and putting it in New York city was the worst idea in the history of Hollywood until some genius decided to take \"Sex and the City\" out of New York city and move it to Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis is also the movie that exposed the severe limits of Nick Nolte's acting abilities.  The only thing worse than his laughably fake and inaccurate southern accent is his \"performance\", which is nothing more than a lesson in how to overact.  He somehow managed to take the Tom Wingo character from the novel and turn him into a completely unsympathetic jerk.\n\nIf I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.\n\nSkip this piece of garbage and read the book.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.\nThis film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!\nAlthough some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!\nKingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.\nHaving watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's \"My God, my God...\" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.\nWhen Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.\nAs my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.\n'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.\nEveryone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Didn't know Brian  Deacon. Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten.

{"text": "Released in 1988, \"The Seventh Sign\" is a creative take on the Bible's end-of-the-world prophecies: Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple (Demi Moore and Michael Biehn) are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.\n\nJesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.\n\nI enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.\n\nOne reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.\n\nI'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.\n\nPeople seem to have trouble categorizing \"The Seventh Sign\" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think \"horror\" in the sense of a slasher flick, \"Seventh Sign\" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.\n\nAs far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.\n\nUnfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although \"The Seventh Sign\" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.\nWith Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.\nThe characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.\nVideo games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.\nThe DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.", "label": 2}

IT'S NOT!  Don't follow my mistakes.

{"text": "Gattaca explores one of the neglected dangers of cloning. While eugenics would actually populate the world with largely benign and perfectly healthy and intelligent people, society would have to become more sophisticated to match those who populate its upper levels.  Those who don't meet the standards of the society in \"Gattaca\" would fall through its cracks, creating a sort of techno-apartheid, bigotry right down to a science.  Ethan Hawke is one of those unlucky 'godchildren' ' born into a sterile future from natural and not in-vitro fertilization. Talk about being born under a bad sign, a post-natal DNA check confirms that Hawke's character will have cardiac, neurological and vision problems and will be unlikely to live past his 30's. (Hawke's father, in an understated but heartbreaking moment, stops the doctors from letting the poor boy become his namesake). Fruitlessly dreaming of becoming an astronaut for the vaunted Gattaca, Vincent ('Hawke's character's eventual name) is confronted with a cruel reality of being 'invalid' ' one of the lower castes reserved for those of bad genes. (To maintain the genetic-ghetto, the police routinely test DNA make-up based on hair, fingernails, dandruff, blood and urine analyses of suspects.) The only spaceships Vincent has any hope of seeing the inside of are the ones he cleans as a janitor. Desperate, Vincent enters the identity black-market, an underworld where Valids on hard times sell their DNA perfect ID's to upwardly mobile invalids. To counter the police, these 'identity-smugglers' provide the tools that will allow Vincent to match up with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid crippled in an accident and reduced to wheelchair-bound and alcohol-fueled self-pity. Vincent has an ambitious plan ' using Jerome's identity, he will re-enter Gattaca (he had once mopped floors there) and become an astronaut. Despite his humble beginnings, Vincent has his fraud well-mapped: he excels as a navigator-trainee and is chosen for an eagerly awaited mission to the moons of Saturn. He takes his fraud very seriously ' careful to leave bits of Jerome's stubble and nail clippings at his work station. At first, everything works out ' not even the coldly analytical director of Gattaca (Gore Vidal) nor an even colder fellow-trainee (Uma Thurman) with whom Vincent falls in love suspect that he is really an invalid. With less than three weeks to the mission, disaster strikes ' one of Gattaca's directors is found dead, murdered and somebody is not only responsible, but has inadvertently left some physical debris behind. The only clue the police have are bits of skin fragments traced to Vincent ' but as far as anybody knows, Vincent hasn't worked in Gattaca in years, and nobody can immediately connect him and Jerome. However, a persistent detective with his own interest in the case throws a tight cordon around Gattaca, convinced that Vincent is hiding among the Valids, hoping to ferret Vincent out. Determined to go into space, Vincent uses every trick he can to stay ahead of the police.\nThis was a great idea for a movie, which is why it loses something in the translation ' Hawke is excellent as the genetically imperfect 'invalid' who uses his desperation to surpasses expectations, but once he becomes Jerome, his story boils down to the tricks he uses to elude detection. The script does little with possibility that Vincent, though it's unfair, really has no place in the advanced society. Uma Thurman is too cold to match Hawke as his love interest. Instead, the script pairs up Jude Law as the 'Valid' who rents DNA to Hawke. At first it's a business proposition ' Vincent's wages can help the drunken Jerome maintain a semblance of his standard of living. Further down, Jerome finds a more symbiotic basis for their relationship.  With the crippled Eugene officially holding a position with the vaunted Gattaca, he can face down anybody who would have dismissed him. Unfortunately, Jerome becomes more self absorbed, undermining what should be a climactic moment in which the wheelchair-bound Jerome must pose as his physically-whole self. What really kills this flick is its vision of a future as if conceived by the guys who do the artwork for Esquire ' with this new age looking like a sedate version of the swinging '60's, complete with electric-versions of period cars, steel and wood architecure, and a cooly non-techno version of just about everything. (Alan Arkin's character, a detective, looks as if he's walked off an episode of 'Naked City'; astronauts fly into space while wearing Armani suits) It's stylish, but the style overwhelms the substance.

{"text": "Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (\"Bum Voyage\" and \"Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?\") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.\n\nHowever, the \"Complete Series\" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.\n\nAnother difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I bought the very same product on VHS tape (in widescreen).\n\nI had hoped that this would truly make it an enhanced viewing experience, since it was on DVD.\n\nYes, it comes in a 2-DVD package, although the container itself is stupid to say the least. A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve.\n\nThe second DVD doesn't offer much more, than the specials already included at the end of the videotape.\n\nGranted, the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart, but was it worth it? NO!\n\nLet me just compare it with the \"LEGEND - Special Edition\" 2-DVD release.\n\nWhat did you get in that one?\n\nFirst of all, since there were two versions of the \"LEGEND\" movie (a Europen/International and a U.S. version), you got them both.\n\nSame feature was included in the \"ALIEN\" superbox, in which one got the theatrical releases and the special/director's cuts, back to back and in the \"X-MEN\" superbox, in which you can easily \"reintegrate\" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control.\n\nHere you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut/additional scenes are left to a special by itself, included in DVD 2.\n\nThe special contents are the very same as the ones included, as said earlier, at the end of the tape.\n\nThe interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting. A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times.\n\nA man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all. He's just old.\n\nTo impose it then to his \"fans???\" is stupid to say the least.\n\nMaybe he is tired, maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic, or so I hope, 'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all, while many never get a chance in their lifetimes), seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent.\n\nI, having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things. Maybe I lack the \"maturity???\" he has achieved?\n\nNevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.\n\nI even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.\n\nIt hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.\n\nIt just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.\n\nI wanted to buy \"E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial\" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.\n\nNor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the \"live\" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?\n\nAs said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.\n\nThese are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain \"youth junk\".\n\nSorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.\n\nI have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.\n\nPlease take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.\n\nWho made you what you are?\n\nThe Studios? The Executives? The Backers?\n\nOr we, the audience?\n\nThink, and think hard!\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever \"rehash\" of the very same product.\n\nBy the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.\n\nStop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.\n\nIt's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.\n\nI can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?\n\nYou only stand to gain from it.\n\nJust remember what Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n\"You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\"\n\nA bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.\n\nDo not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.\n\nUnfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.\n\nThere are even some, able to read between the lines.\n\nSo, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.\n\nYes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.\n\nKeep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.\n\nForget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.\n\nThis is it.\n\nBuy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.\n\nThere are far better movies around.\n\nThis is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.", "label": 2}
{"text": "93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.\n-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.\n-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\n\n\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\n\"It's worse,\" Latham says.\n\nA short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\n\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"\n\nA wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.\n-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.\n-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.\n-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\n\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\n\"Humbug?\"", "label": 1}

(...)\n\nI don't know which is more frustrating about this anniversary dvd, the fact that it doesn't offer widescreen, or the fact that the dvd menu and the special features show the movie clips in widescreen, teasing me with those brief glimpses.\n\nThere is no reason that dvd manufacturers shouldn't at least OFFER a widescreen version.

{"text": "From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.\nA prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.\nFor Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo. It simply hasn't stood the test of time.", "label": 2}

Anderson and Bolt make numerous attempts to describe the set-up to a shot, or any number of other technical matters, but Milla won't have it. All she does is joke around, really bad jokes, and interrupt anyone who talks. She makes fun of the movie, bashes her male co-star repeatedly for something SHE did, and generally acts a fool.

{"text": "Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review.\nFirst of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring\nanother game title to the bring screen.\nAll movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy,\nMortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!!\nOnce I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck.\nI just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it.\nAfter seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made.\nFurthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game.\nIt does not follow up the story and plot to the games.\nIn fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film.\nTo understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt\nto bring the game to the screen, you have to know the\nstory in Resident Evil games.\nAn evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly\nor willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed\na virus called the \"T virus\".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies.\nEven more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows\nabout the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, \"the scene of the mansion\" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine escape only to be separated . (...)\nBirkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus,\nand is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City.\nThat's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it?\nThe Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil\nThe movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation.\nEverthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a\nchemical container containing the T virus into the\nfloor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that\nUmbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and\ncaptured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them.\nIn fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually\npretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL.\nThis is garbage that is made up. In the Re games,\nthere is no \"Red Queen\" that is causing the killing in\nRacoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought\nupon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover\nit up.  Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero.\nThen comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that\nmost of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella,\nis by a computer called \"The Red Queen\" which\nunleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with\nthe \"T virus\".\nPractically the only part of the game that the movie\nstays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the \"T virus\" which it plans to use for germ warfare.\nHowever, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie.\nEventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she\nis put in the custody) of a group of special police cops ,\nto infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on.\nAdding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation\nis that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.  Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating.\nHowever, that person died, along with the evidence that\nUmbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and\nUmbrella.\nEventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic\nimage of the Red Queen who says \"I've been a very bad girl\".\nLOL. Yeah and I would have added \"I've been a bad actress\nto be in this film too\".\nEventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters....\nBesides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games.\nThe zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but\nhere is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie:\nGiant, poisonous spiders,  killer sharks, 2 arm ferocious hunters, large killer poisonous plants and the over 6ft tall indestructible Tyrants in the game.

{"text": "Wow, the first Resident Evil movie was nothing amazing or original but it was a decent, competently made little sci-fi/action/horror flick but this sequel manages to be worse in just about every possible way. Visually the movie looks terrible and shockingly it had a bigger budget than the first movie, never would've guessed that looking at the movie, many times when the zombies appear on screen the picture gets all distorted and the framerate becomes almost like a slideshow, if this was a really low budget movie I would say it was a technical issue but seeing as how it wasn't this was clearly deliberate and why any director would go out of their way to make their movie look as awful as possible is just beyond any logic or coherence. Aside from the that it's also filled with lots of extreme quick cutting, cheap post production looking slow mo, and the action scenes filmed mainly in close ups with quick cutting and shakiness make em utterly unwatchable.\n\nMusic wise it's very bland forgettable techno-ish stuff that lacks the memorable factor of Manson's music from the first movie. For an R rated zombie movie there's not really any blood or gore at all, aside from some F bombs and a few boob shots it feels much more like a PG-13. Aside from Oded Fehr none of the acting is particularily good, even Jovovich is off but I blame the director more than her. Also the big giant monster in the movie suddenly turns good and almost cries, yeah really lame. Easily the worst of the Resident Evil movies and one of the worst mainstream movies of the past decade, it's honestly right up or should I say below there with the average Uwe Boll movie.", "label": 0}

{"text": "That was the dilemma for those who were dealing with the real-life Joan of Arc, and it remains so in reel life in \"The Messenger\".\nI had got some free passes for this movie; my friend John was glad to come with me and my sister because he knew something about it. I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.\nSome things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity. I don't think the real Joan comported herself like that--no one would have followed her into battle otherwise.\nAnother problem was that a famous part of the Joan story is that she hears three saints' voices talking to her; they're the ones who inspire her to fight against England's invasion. But this Joan meets up with Christ himself, and later, with Dustin Hoffman.\nLowdown on \"The Messenger\": if you like authentic-feeling fighting, then rent it for that. If you want something else--like veracity--then get out the encyclopedia.", "label": 2}
{"text": "To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.\n\nThe staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.\n\nThe pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.\n\nOverall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!", "label": 0}

It isn't that I felt that the special effects were dated and no longer amazing. Not at all. I just didn't feel the \"tension\" that I would expect from such an iconic film. I started losing interest right when I should've been on the edge of my seat. When Roy and Jillian (Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon) were climbing up to Devil's tower with the other guy... they were evading the miliary/goverment... I just wasn't feeling too worried about them for some reason. And everything that happened after that seemed pretty flat which is crazy b/c a big mother ship with a bunch of aliens showed up.\n\nOn a positive note, the soundtrack is great. The acting is great. The set design was so accurate. I remember thinking the same thing when I recently watched ET with my kids. \"That really looks like a house where kids live.\" Things are just the right kind of cluttery mess.\n\nNothing is overstated or overdone.

It wasn't some evil, nefarious government plot to screw the people. This could've easily been overdone but wasn't.\n\nOverall, it is one of those movies you should watch, I guess.

Only in a few details it contradicts Genesis, such as:  When Joseph first appears before Pharaoh, the book of Genesis says that he \"shaved,\" implying that he had had a beard before this.  The movie, however, has him clean-shaven throughout.  A serious flaw is that the movie has Joseph's brothers threaten to attack him with spears just before he reveals his identity to them.  Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.\n\nThe scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.

{"text": "Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.\n\nLacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.\n\nOf less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.", "label": 2}

{"text": "this is a great set BUT there is an edit to the film which, for the life of me, I cannot understand on any level.\n\nThe funny thing is I watched it with the Paul Schrader commentary and you'd think he'd notice lines of his own dialogue which were now missing.\n\nAnyway, the scene where Travis takes Iris up to her room -- the guy who rents the room (also featured in Scorsese's Mean Streets) tells Travis something like to \"leave your gun cowboy\" and then when Travis and Iris leave and guy says he will be timing them, you can clearly see the gun in the guy's hand even though the earlier the dialogue was missing.\n\nThen when Travis returns, the guy is carrying Travis' gun up to him to return it but you can barely see it this time -- shot seems shorter and I had to freeze-frame it to even see the gun this time -- and his line about it is gone and suddenly Travis gives him the $20 and says \"this is for you...spend it well\" or something.\n\nI watched this scene a few times and even checked the script (also on the disc) and the scene, or rather the lines and bits of the scene, are gone despite being referenced in the script.\n\nThis is one of my favorite films of all time and I've seen it on its original release at the drive-in, edited on TV, on cable, and on videotape and am sure those lines were in the film.\n\nPlease could someone out there explain this for me?\n\nIs this some kind of retro-tinkering like Lucas did with Star Wars and Spielberg did with E.T.?\n\nI am completely baffled and a bit annoyed.  I hate films being tampered with, especially one of the best films ever made.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I'm begining to understand why The Beatles left England.  This movie is the cinematic equivilant of watching paint dry.  Here, at last, is a movie where one can miss 30 minutes of it and not miss any plot points.  It's the  kind of movie you shouldn't buy snacks for because there's no telling how  long they'll stay down.  This flick is as contrived and mindless as their  music.  But I suppose the point is that they made lots of money -- they  certainly got my brother's [money].  I suppose it's my own fault for  watching it. A good veiwing tip would be a full-frontal lobotomy.  Spice up  your life....", "label": 0}

{"text": "\"Gattaca\" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" but \"Gattaca\" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors.\n\nAs long as the script sticks to the pseduo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for\n\nits own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty\n\nentertaining film.\n\nGrade: B", "label": 2}
