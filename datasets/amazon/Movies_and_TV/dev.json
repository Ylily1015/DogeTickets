I saw the United Kingdom release, Region 2 encoded, and it is much better.  You can get an idea of the difference in picture and colour quality on the Upstairs Downstairs web site, video availability page at [...]  A&E should be ashamed to give this excellent series such a bad treatment and charge over $300 for the insult.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen.  I can't believe I paid to see it in a theater.  This was even worse than when I paid $25 (I was in Japan) to see Twister.  I was surprised to find out that this was a Luc  Besson film, because La Femme Nikita was good and The Professional had a  lot of soul, too.  I think by the time he made the 5th Element, Besson had  totally lost his mind and good taste.  This movie stunk in a very big way  from start to finish.  And it was long, it seemed an eternity.  There's a  few talented actors in the movie (Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich) but they  pretty much stink in it too.  Every aspect of the film was bad, but  probably the worst was the acting of the young woman who plays Joan.  Not  only unbelievable, but annoying and unlikeable.  Also, the unnecessary  violence really left me feeling dirty when the movie was finished.  I hope  nobody buys or rents this video, not to punish Besson, but simply because  nobody should have to sit through this.  But of course they will because of  the big names in it.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Tried to care about this elegant saga, but despite all the fetching details and careful crafting, it all feels rather pointless. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a radiant performance in her effort to negotiate these overstuffed rooms and overwrought sensibilities, but can't quite manage it.\n\nThe stumbling point, in my view, Daniel Day-Lewis here plainly just doesn't cut it as a leading man. His emasculated, simpering deadpan, dispensing dialogue medicinally as so much cough syrup, completely fails to engage as a romantic figure. The notion of Michelle's ravishing, vivacious character head over heels for him is more than a stretch. I've seen gunfighters with more chemistry than these two. Their first intimate scene, eek! Comes off like a stumble in a crowded bus. This mis-casting is disappointing, as the movie appears in many ways to have had real promise.\n\nWynona Ryder does well enough as the porcelain, sidelined fiance, but what does it matter, the whole thing fails on the glaring mismatch of the leads.", "label": 2}

The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.\n\nThe only problem is with the dvd which is not restored in any way and so the picture and sound quality really suffer in comparison with what's currently out there.  There are no special features of note either.  This film is certainly one of the funniest and most enjoyable that I've ever seen but my advice is to wait for the Blu-ray version that significantly restores the picture quality as well as adds good special features and has good audio options such as at a minimum a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option to do justice to your home theatre system.", "label": 0}

She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role.\nTo add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting? Is this a God given hair color change? Or is it a vision from  Clairol?\n\nFaye Dunaway and John Malkovich give good performances but they are not in enough of the movie to save it. By the time Dustin Hoffman shows up at the end, who even cares?\n Aside from the great opening, the hole mishmash shows no insight into Joan of Arc.  After the fascinating opening--the ball is dropped and that is the director and lead actor's fault.  Lead a nation in battle?

Sure the Zombies are no where as scary as the ones in Romero's films, just seem more like people with rabies than the living dead, lol. What I was surprised about though was the acting, it wasn't all that bad. Think Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) gives her best performance yet, Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast & the Furious) is pretty good too. Getting rid of George Romero was the biggest mistake though as I was really looking forward to a come-bat. Mean the director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead doing Resident Evil would of been a dream come true. Sure his scrpt that was canned was much better too.\n  Well anyway despite that let down, besides the acting I also liked the action, especially the train sequence at the end. Think there's a little too much confusing in the very end though, leaves too many loose ends. For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.", "label": 2}

Billy Hayes was a drug smuggler simple as that.

We got his long drawn out build up to the escape and when it happened everything was over in 10 minutes. I also did not see any caucasian Turkish prison guards with 5 days growth and long straggy hair but he managed to fool the twenty guards he walked past.

{"text": "This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: \"Outstanding Miniseries.\" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular \"Bible Collection\" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as \"proof.\" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish", "label": 1}
{"text": "Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you. Kick ass film... yeah right... idiots. If the review sounds rough, sorry. Very angry man. Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer. I Hope the studios see sense and don't make a 3rd resi film, and leave it a few years for a proper director to come in and revive the franchise in the proper way.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:\n\nWhat a LOAD!\n\nTell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.\n\nI swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.\n\nY'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.\n\nThe ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.\n\nIt is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the \"R\" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.\n\nAll the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of \"Aw, man, I really liked him/her too\".\n\nNow, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.\n\nThe zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say \"Oh yeah, they're here too\". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, \"Holy crap, they're screwed\".\n\nNot necessarily so, Lois.\n\nInstead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).\n\nNaturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our \"Zombie Reminders\" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.\n\nOkay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.\n\nThen there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.\n\nAll of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.\n\nVery Little.", "label": 0}

Then it goes immediately back to focusing on Joseph.  God's written word is obviously trying to make a point and show a comparison.

In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning. If it wasn't a complete rip off (say if the character was the same) it wouldn't have been so glaringly bad, but when you go to see a movie you go to see \"new\" thoughts and ideas not just shifted image stolen from video games with different characters doing things that run logically against the game that the images are being stolen from.\n\nAn ok movie for people who have never played the game..\n\nBut the action super hero twist and rip-off only serve to tarnish the fact that its supposed to be a \"resident evil\" movie.

{"text": "The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.\n\nIn this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in \"Wives and Daughters\", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version\n\nThe 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.\n\nThe book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: \"Oliver Twist\" 1839, \"A Christmas Carol\" 1843, and \"David Copperfield\" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story \"Great Expectations\" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of \"Great Expectations\" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.\n\nCharles Dickens's book \"Oliver Twist\" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The \"Oliver Twist\" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play \"Oliver Twist\"; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story \"Great Expectations\" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Zombies and guns. Trapped. Zombies and guns. Running. Zombies and guns... It may sound like B-grade, popcorn, adolescent male fodder, but Resident Evil is actually a well-crafted movie of the survival-horror genre. Eschewing gore in favor of imagination, it skimps on the on-screen bloodbath, and instead plays a guessing game that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.\nThe scenario is that in the ultra secret military lab of the Umbrella Corporation, an extremely volatile virus has been set loose. The alarm is triggered, and the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence system, quarantines \"the hive\" to prevent the virus from reaching Raccoon City, trapping the workers in the process.\nIn an effort to save the survivors and salvage the research, a team of commandoes is sent in to reboot the Red Queen, before she seals the Hive permanently. A simple objective, but one immediately complicated by the discovery of our protagonist, Alice, a young woman suffering from amnesia. She has no memory, but the Team Lead recognizes her as an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, so she is taken into the hive with them.\nWhat she finds there makes her doubt that she wants her memory back.\nIt may sound like overdone tripe, but Resident Evil (RE) takes some of the old horror cliches and makes them new again. Alice's memory loss is handled with intelligence, and enough mystery to keep the viewer guessing. The gore is minimal, as the film culls its scares from sound cues and implication rather than onscreen blood. Unlike so many other horror movies, it doesn't have gaping holes in it's plot (though there are a couple of lapses in continuity). Instead it cleverly weaves it's elements, slowly revealing how everything came to pass as it heads towards it climax. The coup de grace though, is the action. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez put the \"grrr!\" in \"girl.\" Wallflowers won't survive in the Hive, and these two ladies are intent on living. When the ammo's gone, they resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.\nI won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares. But for those that love a good action movie, pop a bag of popcorn, and make yourself comfy on the couch. You're in for a hell of a thrill ride. And when the movie's done, check out the special features. The 2-disc Collector's Edition coming later this year will have the lion's share, but the Special Edition is no slouch.

{"text": "I saw this film once and once was enough. As a secular free-thinker but  Catholic as a child I was taught Jeanne was a saint. Even now, she remains a puzzlement. ntil lately, I could find no objective books about her until I found a book by Frances Gies and other sensible historians (not dramatists) who presented this heroine in a most objective and respectful historical account. Hero tough, unshakeable faith in what she believed  caused her to go to crown Charles the dauphin as Charles VII of France, and to accomplish this she will have to lead an army and raise the siege of--and defeat the English in--Orleans. On that pathway she carried a banner and inspired thousands by proving herself. The film title Messenger does not suit her; more likely it should have been titled The Battle Within. If Jeanne had behaved in real life as she did in the film she would never been put at the head of an army--in fact Robert de Baudricourt would never have outfitted her to go to war but sent her home under guard. Milla Jovovich did a great job of playing a hysterical schizophrenic, not Jeanne D'Arc.\n\nIn the 1400s medieval males, essentially the English army, believed women who were with soldiers were prostitutes. In most of the films about her she was were portrayed, (though erring on the side of religious mysticism)  her as someone with, along with excessive piety, still had some common sense, a very loving, confident, and brave girl (she begins her \"assignment\" at age 17) with no riding or battle experience, is illiterate, and of the people, she never forgets the goal, in short, a believable leader. In The Messenger if it was meant to be analytical they miss the mark by a mile. She is portrayed as a hypertensive, hysterical, half scared Jeanne who, when finally realizing she is doomed to a horrid death, sees her \"conscience\" or some Guy in Black, come into her cell and tell her in effect that she got the wrong message and the joke is on her. As other reviewers who share my disappointment in this film have stolen my thunder and I applaud them for it, I will not repeat what is already intelligently opined.\n\nBut when I saw Dustin Hoffman come barging into her already doomed condition, playing what seemed a Bad Guy, or a spoiler,the \"devil\" or god or a conscience, some unnecessary addition, it really made me shake my head. Years later, after reading the IMDB-presented dialogue  between Jeanne and Hoffman on line, telling her she never heard anything she didn't want to hear, I was plain disgusted. Sure, Hoffman was a good actor in a cameo role and can do no wrong EXCEPT agree to appear as this creepy guy who symbolizes something sinister. Well, I knew why I had stopped watching the movie: because at is precisely where it should have ended  Because that would have added everything up just fine. We all know from history the trial was rigged and that she was burned at the stake: her decision to resume male attire was her downfall--she was attacked by guards when she wore women's dress designated h er as relapsed. She was a true innocent in real life and did what she believed and was portrayed woefully wrongly. What a shame, they got Jeanne all wrong for the sake of titillating entertainment.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I was so upset after watching this film, I had to write a review somewhere to caution people not to watch it.  The old silent version is the best I've ever seen of St. Joan, and the other '90s version with Leelee Sobieski did a much better job of showing St. Joan's human struggles as a young girl responding to the call of the divine, but used by and eventually abandoned by earthly powers.\nOkay, here are my issues with this depiction of the saint's life:\n\n1) The rape scene she witnessed with her sister.  This appears nowhere in the stories of her life.  Yes, we have very little hard facts to go by, but this fabrication made it look like Joan was motivated by revenge for her sister's murder and rape, rather than a holy calling.  The rest of the film for the most part supports this view (Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of her \"Conscience,\" for instance).\n2) The scenes where, after her sister's funeral, Joan refuses to make the sign of the cross, and then removes a chalice of wine from the church's tabernacle, makes the motions of consecrating it, and then pours it down her throat after shouting \"I want to be with you NOW!\"  There are two ways you could understand this behavior:  From a secular perspective, she totally lost grasp of reality after her sister's death.  From a faith perspective, this is complete heresy, not to mention silly misrepresentation of Catholic communion.  There would never have been a chalice of precious blood in the tabernacle (only the Eucharist, the hosts that have been consecrated at mass).  If someone ever performed any behavior like this, they would never be canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Period.\n3) The trippy scenes of her visions, where she encounters a slightly creepy Christ figure, and not St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael the Archangel.  I don't even know where to start with Dustin Hoffman's character.  When I first saw him, I thought he was depicting Satan tormenting her in prison (his behavior certainly seemed more in-line with this analysis, although the credits list him as her \"Conscience\").  Then at the end, he hears her confession and then absolves her of her sin!  We know St. Joan was confessed (by an actual human priest) and received the Eucharist, because we have the priest's testimony.  Another inaccuracy:  They show her finding her sword in a field, and her \"Conscience\" has her consider all the possible ways that what she interpreted as a sign from God could actually have been just random chance.  While it is good to be cautious with interpreting signs, and should be discerned under the guidance of a trusted spiritual director, it is one of the basic elements of her biography that she found her sword in a chapel (I believe it was under a statue of St. Catherine).\n5)Her death scene, where she is screaming as she burns at the stake, while some random person in the crowd waves a cross about, is very disturbing.  Yes the reality of someone being burned to death at the stake is pretty unnerving, but there seems to be something almost mocking about the cross, and her behavior looks more like despair than holy resignation (I know, I could never muster holy resignation while being burned... which is why I'm not a saint).  In her biography, St. Joan asked that someone lift up the cross that she might see it as she died, and her last word as she burned was \"Jesus.\"\n\nThere were a few good moments in this movie.  I like that they show her repeatedly insisting that the army sends messages asking for the surrender of the English.  I like the scene where she rides across the field of battle to do this, prays for an end to bloodshed, and then the English turn away without fighting.  I like how they depicted her discovering the Dauphin in disguise.  But for the most part they made her seem like a raving lunatic.  It was a patronizing film told like the perspective of someone who does not believe in miracles, taking what I will admit is one of the more bizarre and mystifying saints' lives, and looking down on the ignorant peasant girl with a bit of spirit who got a little too much religion which made her an easy pawn for the political powers of her day.  Read the transcripts from her trial and you see a clever and faith-filled woman who is clearly grounded in reality.  This film is a gross oversimplification to the point of obfuscation of the real story of an incredible saint.", "label": 0}

{"text": "But I doubt it was a plot that someone like me was supposed was to understand in the first place! :) If I'd understood the plot a little better, I'd definitely be giving this four stars - the way it stands at the moment, it's borderline four stars. I think the plot was just a little too complicated for me!\n\nI've never played the game, although I've watched it being played, so I recognised a few of the places, and got other places pointed out which were in relation to places in the game. I wasn't sure what it was about beforehand, but I loved the zombies! Of course people are going to draw comparisons with the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, as they feature heavily on the walking dead, but in this, there's new, inventive and very gory ways of killing people and the walking dead. Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S. Anderson signed on to write and direct the movie. This film was originally titled \"Resident Evil: Ground Zero,\" but the title was changed to just \"Resident Evil\" after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA.\n\nAnd for the guys - Milla Jovovich gets naked! Which I got told about before the movie started. Do you see me caring?! It's also weird, because her character, Alice, never has her name spoken, written or identified until the end credits.\n\nThe scene with the lasers is definitely a scene you need to watch out for. It's so weird to watch, as you think they're OK, and then the bodies split apart in all kinds of ways! Ugh!\n\nFor some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.\n\nA newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.\n\nI don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.\n\nThere's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off \"her\" head - the medic in the laser hallway.\n\nWith a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!\n\nThe extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.\n\nThis is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.", "label": 2}

Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.

Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of \"The Awful Truth\" or \"Talk of the Town\".

This is just a theory, but I have a suspicion that old movies that have been deemed \"classics\" get a much more benevolent treatment when it comes to reviews. Perhaps this may be due to nostalgia. I'm not bashing old movies in general. In fact, many old movies appear on my Top 100 Films list (Billy Budd, Fail Safe, Psycho, Ben Hur, It's A Wonderful Life, Zorba The Greek, The Virgin Spring, etc.) But like the vast majority of older movies, this film has acting that is way over the top (overacting) and dialog that is totally cornball. Some may rightly enjoy this campiness. I don't. Another distracting thing about this film is that there are plot sequences (particularly relating to their trek with the explosives cargo) that were simply illogical and seemed to be capriciously thrown in so as to create a foundation for a thrill/action scene. The films cinematography and art direction are wonderful and that's what will stand out in my memory of this film.

{"text": "This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!\n\nIt all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.\n\nBut then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.\n\nDon't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.\n\nMorton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.\n\nIn the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!\n\nThere are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to \"The governess,\"while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!\n\nThe second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.\n\nIn the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:\n\n\"So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?\" sneers Rochester.\n\n\"I found someone who wanted to marry me.\" again, the self-satisfied smile.\n\nGood lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.\n\nAs we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.\n\nThe story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.\n\nAs for the \"scares\", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's \"jumps\"(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).\n\nThe performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across.

I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.\nThis was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while.

{"text": "Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras.\n\nThis is because while \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five.\n\nLet's start with the movie and some background on its history.\n\nFirst, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.\n\nIt's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. \"Super Mario Brothers\"? Awful. Van Damme's \"Streetfighter\"? Mediocre at best. \"House of the Dead\"? Dumb.\n\nWhich is why when \"Resident Evil\" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, \"Resident Evil\" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.\n\nIt also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with \"28 Days Later,\" the new \"Dawn of the Dead,\" and the Brit comedy \"Shaun of the Dead.\"\n\nThat trend continues now with \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse,\" which picks up right where the first film ended.\n\nThe bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.\n\nReturning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the \"Resident Evil\" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.\n\nOther game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.\n\nPart of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(\"Mortal Kombat\", \"Aliens Vs. Predator\"). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.\n\nAnderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.\n\nI'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:\n\nPoor attention to characters - Though \"Resident Evil\" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.\n\nNot enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.\n\nMike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the \"Friday\" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the same tired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.\n\nAt least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.\n\nNow for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink.\n\nMost interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.  Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think.\n\nI also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them.\n\nWhile this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like \"28 Days Later\" and the new \"Dawn of the Dead\" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  \"Resident Evil:Apocalyse\" just didn't quite meet that challenge.\n\nOne thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in \"Resident Evil 3.\" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.", "label": 2}

I mean, silent mode and turbine boost? So realistically done too. Now, I just chuckle at how foolish I was having watched the movie again. Naturally, it wasn't quite as fun as when I watched it many years ago, still, it had some pretty nifty aerial combat sequences featuring some very low flying urban chase scenes and special effects that were way too good for its time.

{"text": "I decided to intentionally not watch this movie on the big screen, after hearing reviews from several people. I then wasn't sure if I wanted see the movie at all, but I broke down and rented it anyway, as I am a big fan of Joan of Arc.\nFrom the moment I read about her sister's rape on the cover, I knew I'd have a difficult time watching this movie, since that event never happened.  After watching the whole thing, I found that my initial impressions were correct.  This movie was just a movie, _not_ a historical documentary, which is something to definitely keep in mind.  It would've been nice if Besson had referenced the trial transcripts for a better idea of how Joan actually lived, but alas.\nI (generously) give a rating of one star, only because this work has spread a little more awareness of the life and death of Joan of Arc.  I would also give this movie two enthusiastic thumbs down, except for the battle scenes, and Besson didn't even get all of those right, so a somewhat shaky one thumb up for the battle scenes. The reason for this rating is quite simple - Monty Python and the Holy Grail was much more historically accurate than easily at least half of this hellishly awful piece-of-... movie that rotted sea monkeys could've done better with.  It's much more entertaining, as well.\nThe beginning did not impress me at all.  I found the scrolling white text to be rather small, and I had to pause to read what was trying to be conveyed.  Also, Joan did not find her sword as it was portrayed in this movie.  (Why a small shepherdess would need a huge sword to tend sheep is still beyond me.)  I didn't really care for the hooked-on-drugs vision in the forest, either.\nThe scene in which Joan's sister was raped may have been appropriate if the event had actually happened.  I found it to be distasteful, especially as there were so many things in Joan's life that Besson could have chosen to emphasize.  The invention of a falsity to \"enhance\" an already miraculous story just strikes me as ridiculous.\nThe scene where Joan rushes in to drink from the communion chalice is not accurate at all.  Speaking as a Catholic liturgist, the Blood of Christ (communion wine after consecration) was and still is never stored in the tabernacle (where the extra consecrated bread goes after communion), which would have been locked anyway.  Joan also would not have had access to drinking the wine to begin with.  She was not full of manufactured rage, as Besson would like us to think.  Lisa Simpson from television's \"The Simpsons\" was more accurately portrayed, as far as young Joans go.  \"Who, me?  But I'm just a little girl!\"\nJoan also never said anything about God being angry with the English... the trial records clearly state that she didn't know if God was against the English, but he wanted them out of France.  The scene with the arrow in her chest was very touching, but she went straight back to the battle, and the battle was won that same day, NOT the next day as shown.  The more exciting storyline in this section lies in actual fact - how amazing!\nI do like how Milla plays Jehanne, except for the unnecessary hysterics.  (I liked Milla in \"The Fifth Element\" and in \"Zoolander\", too.)  I also liked the concept of Dustin Hoffman's role.  This was a nice spin on things, along with the symbolic meaning of Joan's hair turning from lightness to darkness through the course of the movie.  I also liked how John Malkovich played Charles, and appreciated that Besson was accurate in the \"Find the Dauphin\" game.\nHistory records Joan wearing male clothing during the trial, and with her head shaved for the burning.  The miter Joan wore on \"stake day\" was noticeably absent.  A cross was not held up as Joan's body burned; it was a crucifix (amazing what difference a little body makes).\nI am now wondering about how many other things I've missed, since I was too bewildered at Besson's storytelling approach to write most of my thoughts down.  Factual accuracy aside, this movie could have been made into so much more.  It's highly disappointing, yet somewhat pretty to look at if you aren't aware of \"the real story\".\nBleaach.  See \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" by Carl Dreyer instead!  At least that made Ebert's top 100 great movies list.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.\n\nAnyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are won't to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.\n\nTo give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)\n\nPerformances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.\n\nAs if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.\n\nAlso, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.\n\nGrade: C", "label": 2}
{"text": "I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.", "label": 1}

And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking \"is that it, after all that slow build-up?\".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.\n\nI have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.

Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating.\nIf you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original \"Night of the Living Dead\"). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.\n  There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick.\nI give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead.

However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.\nThe color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc.

{"text": "In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement. Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day. Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge. Strange events begin to happen and people start dying. No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop. It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.\n\nI watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night. Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night. Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep. Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).\n\nHowever, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time. I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me. I just didn't find the movie very scary. Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie. Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say \"it's garbage\".\n\nThere are many who will find the movie quite frightening. Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive. The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too. Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.", "label": 2}

I think Mr Hinds did an excellent job despite all the shouting and there were several times in the film when he was able to bring out Mr Rochester's more tender side & this all seemed to work well for the character. I was very disappointed in the way Jane seemed unable, for all her passionate words to actually kiss the man. I have seen Samantha Morton in other films & have liked her work immensely. In much of the dialog she shows true passion in her speaking but it seems that she could never really bring herself to kiss Mr Rochester on the lips, cheek-yes, lips-no, not really. If they weren't meant to kiss then the film could have done without the close-up camera views that made this so obvious to me. It seemed, to me, that a real kiss was avoided at every embrace. Even near the end of the movie when they were reunited with no impediments between them, professing their undying love, there was not one real kiss. The book was not portrayed true to form which so often happens when novels are made into movies but if you are going to film a passionate embrace & kiss to demonstrate a passionate love, shouldn't it be a real kiss?", "label": 2}

{"text": "Twenty years ago, a movie like \"Resident Evil\" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's \"Thirteen Ghosts\" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality.\nThe film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them.\nEnter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more.\nThe underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown.\nThe real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber.\n... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares.\nOn those grounds, \"Resident Evil\" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I recently re-viewed Taxi Driver to see if it might make a better impression than 30 years ago.  It didn't.  Scorcese's confounding lack of character development, a gratuitous and underdeveloped plot, grimy violence, and lurid musical score contribute to a sludgy mess that gained accolades over the years primarily due to its cutting edge approach to the subject matter.  Well, it's no longer 1976, and the decades gone by have not been kind to the film.\n\nTruly great films transcend the times in which they were made, and Taxi Driver, with its mannered and one dimensional performances, suffers from a lack of emotional credibility.  We never witness Bickle's motivations or demons, instead viewing him as a two dimensional, socially inept caricature who can't handle male-female interaction. Then, almost spontaneously he obsesses on making a violent \"big statement\".  The dialog and plotting provides little insight into this tormented man's inner voices- Is he suffering PTSD? Is he the product of a terrible home situation? Where do the violent and anti-social tendencies come from? What are Bickle's primary motivations?\n\nI'm incredulous as to how Taxi Driver has sustained its aura after all these years when it basically plays out like a low budget, violent melodrama with a tawdry and frankly unbelievable conclusion. If it wasn't for Jodie Foster's amazing portrayal of the world weary teenage prostitute, there'd be little reason to watch the film other than for curiosity's sake.", "label": 0}

The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.

{"text": "For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.\n\nThe scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.\n\nIn a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.\n\nWinkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.", "label": 2}

The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later.

{"text": "For such a historical figure, I expected a bit more coming into the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie simply because of the story, the action, and the time-period.  Unfortunately, however, Joan of Arc - the catalyst for legendary events in French history, the end of a war, and the first person anyone thinks of when there is even the slightest mentioning of burning at the stake - really deserves more.\n\nFirst, the positive aspects of this movie probably outweigh the bad.  The scenery, style, and medieval genre is represented well.  The film has a very powerful feel, and properly displays how thoughts, beliefs, and energy can be controlled and swayed by the power of religion.  Such greatness has been accomplished through religion, but this film also shows the gritty realism of widespread death that has been brought about from religious intolerance.\n\nThe bad, however, is two-fold: acting and influence.\n\nJoan of Arc was probably not a hyperventilating, over-reacting, deranged, incompetent military leader.  If I were French I would hate this movie.  It basically paints Joan of Arc as a vindictive, revenge-driven, screaming harpy.  The fact that Milla Jovavich seems to have read an \"Acting for Dummies\" book written by Jim Carey - where facial contortions and eyeball bulging trump conveyance of emotion through acting - definitely didn't help either.\n\nWhereas Joan of Arc was tried for heresy, to me the people who made this movie should be charged with something similar.  There is nearly no mention of Joan's military prowess, her benevolence, or her true religious devotion.  The fact that there is almost an insinuation that she was speaking to the devil, rather than Jesus, is almost blasphemous.\n\nThere's also the character I like to call \"Creepy Jesus\".  It's almost as if everyone involved really wanted to show religion as an ugly part of humanity, the possibility of visions being realistic or divine, or that there is inherent value in religion.  There could not have been a weirder actor chosen for the character of Jesus, and there surely couldn't have been a more negative portrayal of religion.\n\nThe Messenger covers most of the historical details decent enough, entertains the audience quite well, but it's just painfully obvious that the director was interested in psychoanalysis of Joan, her actions, her visions, and religion in general.", "label": 2}

The David to Goliath theme is a time tested and wonderful one that fits Re like a glove.  Why the writers chose to leave it behind is beyond me.\n\nIn this movie, one will see way too many obvious deaths and plot twists.  There are at least 6 instances of characters firing at a zombie just behind a human for the \"oh wow you saved me while looking like you were going to kill me\" effect.  There are also humerous instances of the \"suprise attack\" by zombies that seem to leap out of the framework to fall upon unsuspecting characters.  Added to the mix came main characters with such amazing pistol skills that they can hit a zombie in the head every time.  Ever since Mission Impossible Two directors have thought this is something audiences want to see but I for one am getting VERY tired of it.\n\nBut the absolute worst thing about this movie is the irreverant use of the Resident Evil characters in the game without any thought to who or what they are.  It is painfully obvious that the director chose to use Jill Valentine from RE 1 and 3 the game because she is a woman and can \"sex the screen up.\"  Her intro to the movie has her walking into a police station and shooting zombies in the head without any explination of how she knows to do this or why she seems to be in trouble.  Sure, there is a bit of allusion to her disgrace but no explination.  Well folks...here it is.  Jill was part of the elite STARS unit that responded to a dusturbance at the Umbrella mansion and were nearly wiped out by the unleashed zombies.  When they tried to return with their story, Umbrella supressed it and made sure the STARS were disbanded.  When Racoon City slides into anarchy, Nemesis is unleashed to remove the surviving STARS as witnesses to Umbrella's complicity.  Now why could't they have had a montage in the movie with all that!  I, for one, would have enjoyed it more than the questionable action scenes and thin plot.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').\n\nInstead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.\n\nThe differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \"true story\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\" and, \"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\"", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have pretty high standards when it comes to movies...AND TV shows, and I can't, for the life of me, see what is so gawrsh-awful about this movie. Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....\n\nThe story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.\n\nWhat follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!\n\nThe cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.\n\nAll in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking \"Father\", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.\n\nWhile it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!! And ESPECIALLY her?? Didn't \"Batman & Robin\" tell them ANYTHING??!!", "label": 2}

I couldn't get over the fact that the first one was fairly good, and this one just let me down. The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film. Even Jovovich who is a decent actress did a poor job, and don't even get me started on the other actors. Especially the chick who played Jill. Just watch the way she holds her guns. She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake! And if you haven't played the games or read the books, you will have no idea whats going on. It never even explained what the S.T.A.R.S were, and therefor leaves all the non-gamers totally clueless.\n\nIf you actually liked this movie I recomend: House of the Dead, its a HORRIBLE zombie flick. The worst I have ever seen, actually worse than this one. And if you liked both movies, you have bad taste.\n\nWhat I learned from Resident Evil: Apocalypse: Nothing, this is a no-brainer.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This is certainly the best independent film ever made and is also one of the best films ever.  This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter-culture a.k.a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the \"land of the free and the home of the brave?\"  Fonda and Hopper play a couple of bikers who ironically in trying to live a free life become hated by the mainstream who fear what this freedom represents.  This eventually results in their persecution and destruction.  I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.\n\nJack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.\n\nOtherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.\n\nInspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.\n\nUpdated 29 May 2011:\n\nAs Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.", "label": 2}

I've seen most of the Joan films except the one with Ingrid Bergman, which I haven't been able to find. I'm not an expert on the historical Joan, but I can compare films. The Joan films have been good, bad, and indifferent. The silent film is beyond compare. This one falls somewhere between bad and indifferent. Someone else mentioned the mix of accents. It drove me crazy. Most of the French army sounded more English than the English and Joan sounded like she was from Illinois. I also get extremely annoyed with historically based films that feel compelled to dumb down the dialogue by salting the dialogue with contemporary-usage obscenities and vulgarities. As a historical novelist myself, one of the things I research meticulously is the slang of the period. Nothing pulls you out of a historical moment like a 20th century slang coming form a long-ago character. I guess ultimately I have to say it's an ok movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend money on it. If you want to buy a Joan film, opt for the 1928 silent. The added orchestral score is wonderful. The acting will break your heart. This one *shrug*\n\nRuth Sims", "label": 0}

Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.\nThe time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.\nStill, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.\nFiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.\nConnery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series.

{"text": "I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.\nThis is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film. The television Avengers' unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.\n\nWith more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.\nActually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.\nI was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.", "label": 1}

I agree with the negative aspects of some of the reviewers, such as, given how this film was made, I could not really care about what happened to most of the people, although there were a few positive aspects of the making this film.  For example, the dialogue, when I could hear it, was spare, even terse, no nonsense, which seems to fit the strenuous physical (and mental) exertion of the climb up and the descent---no time, energy, thought for hyperbole.\n\nThe most annoying thing about the film, for me however, was the music, which was so loud---and I fear uninteresting, uninspired---that often I could not hear what anyone was saying.  I had to sit up close and listen carefully to hear what the actors were saying.  The point is that the musical score itself was not a good enough reason to watch this film to the bitter end.  I was happy that I had read the book first.  So, again I say, read the book.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's \"Sweet and Lowdown\", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.\n\n2.5/5", "label": 0}

In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema.", "label": 2}

Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.

{"text": "\"The Prince of Tides\" is my favorite novel.  This movie has very little to do with the book.\n\nTaking this story out of South Carolina and putting it in New York city was the worst idea in the history of Hollywood until some genius decided to take \"Sex and the City\" out of New York city and move it to Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis is also the movie that exposed the severe limits of Nick Nolte's acting abilities.  The only thing worse than his laughably fake and inaccurate southern accent is his \"performance\", which is nothing more than a lesson in how to overact.  He somehow managed to take the Tom Wingo character from the novel and turn him into a completely unsympathetic jerk.\n\nIf I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.\n\nSkip this piece of garbage and read the book.", "label": 0}

{"text": "This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.\nThis film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!\nAlthough some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!\nKingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.\nHaving watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's \"My God, my God...\" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.\nWhen Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.\nAs my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.\n'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.\nEveryone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "label": 1}

My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten.

{"text": "One of the most oft recounted stories of betrayal and redemption of all time, that of patriarch Joseph at the hands of his envious and spiteful brothers, is retold once again in this film.  The film's greatest contribution to the story is the deep emotion that it conveys.  Viewers will actually feel the loss, the betrayal, the hopelessness, the anger, the love and the joy that these characters experience and convey.  Less overt but still present are the supernatural interventions by Joseph's God, a pivitol element of the story and certainly not lost in this picture.  The production is simple yet effective; neither flashy nor flaunting, it simply tells the story of how God acted in the life of one family whose descendant would one day change the world forever.  Highly recommended and deeply moving.", "label": 1}

{"text": "\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\"  is a 1970 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. The film stars Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThis special is a classic.  Some images have now been cut because of various stupid reasons.\n\nThis is still a cartoon that everyone will enjoy.

{"text": "Released in 1988, \"The Seventh Sign\" is a creative take on the Bible's end-of-the-world prophecies: Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple (Demi Moore and Michael Biehn) are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.\n\nJesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.\n\nI enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.\n\nOne reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.\n\nI'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.\n\nPeople seem to have trouble categorizing \"The Seventh Sign\" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think \"horror\" in the sense of a slasher flick, \"Seventh Sign\" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.\n\nAs far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.\n\nUnfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although \"The Seventh Sign\" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.\nWith Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.\nThe characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.\nVideo games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.\nThe DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Gattaca explores one of the neglected dangers of cloning. While eugenics would actually populate the world with largely benign and perfectly healthy and intelligent people, society would have to become more sophisticated to match those who populate its upper levels.  Those who don't meet the standards of the society in \"Gattaca\" would fall through its cracks, creating a sort of techno-apartheid, bigotry right down to a science.  Ethan Hawke is one of those unlucky 'godchildren' ' born into a sterile future from natural and not in-vitro fertilization. Talk about being born under a bad sign, a post-natal DNA check confirms that Hawke's character will have cardiac, neurological and vision problems and will be unlikely to live past his 30's. (Hawke's father, in an understated but heartbreaking moment, stops the doctors from letting the poor boy become his namesake). Fruitlessly dreaming of becoming an astronaut for the vaunted Gattaca, Vincent ('Hawke's character's eventual name) is confronted with a cruel reality of being 'invalid' ' one of the lower castes reserved for those of bad genes. (To maintain the genetic-ghetto, the police routinely test DNA make-up based on hair, fingernails, dandruff, blood and urine analyses of suspects.) The only spaceships Vincent has any hope of seeing the inside of are the ones he cleans as a janitor. Desperate, Vincent enters the identity black-market, an underworld where Valids on hard times sell their DNA perfect ID's to upwardly mobile invalids. To counter the police, these 'identity-smugglers' provide the tools that will allow Vincent to match up with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid crippled in an accident and reduced to wheelchair-bound and alcohol-fueled self-pity. Vincent has an ambitious plan ' using Jerome's identity, he will re-enter Gattaca (he had once mopped floors there) and become an astronaut. Despite his humble beginnings, Vincent has his fraud well-mapped: he excels as a navigator-trainee and is chosen for an eagerly awaited mission to the moons of Saturn. He takes his fraud very seriously ' careful to leave bits of Jerome's stubble and nail clippings at his work station. At first, everything works out ' not even the coldly analytical director of Gattaca (Gore Vidal) nor an even colder fellow-trainee (Uma Thurman) with whom Vincent falls in love suspect that he is really an invalid. With less than three weeks to the mission, disaster strikes ' one of Gattaca's directors is found dead, murdered and somebody is not only responsible, but has inadvertently left some physical debris behind. The only clue the police have are bits of skin fragments traced to Vincent ' but as far as anybody knows, Vincent hasn't worked in Gattaca in years, and nobody can immediately connect him and Jerome. However, a persistent detective with his own interest in the case throws a tight cordon around Gattaca, convinced that Vincent is hiding among the Valids, hoping to ferret Vincent out. Determined to go into space, Vincent uses every trick he can to stay ahead of the police.\nThis was a great idea for a movie, which is why it loses something in the translation ' Hawke is excellent as the genetically imperfect 'invalid' who uses his desperation to surpasses expectations, but once he becomes Jerome, his story boils down to the tricks he uses to elude detection. The script does little with possibility that Vincent, though it's unfair, really has no place in the advanced society. Uma Thurman is too cold to match Hawke as his love interest. Instead, the script pairs up Jude Law as the 'Valid' who rents DNA to Hawke. At first it's a business proposition ' Vincent's wages can help the drunken Jerome maintain a semblance of his standard of living. Further down, Jerome finds a more symbiotic basis for their relationship.  With the crippled Eugene officially holding a position with the vaunted Gattaca, he can face down anybody who would have dismissed him. Unfortunately, Jerome becomes more self absorbed, undermining what should be a climactic moment in which the wheelchair-bound Jerome must pose as his physically-whole self. What really kills this flick is its vision of a future as if conceived by the guys who do the artwork for Esquire ' with this new age looking like a sedate version of the swinging '60's, complete with electric-versions of period cars, steel and wood architecure, and a cooly non-techno version of just about everything. (Alan Arkin's character, a detective, looks as if he's walked off an episode of 'Naked City'; astronauts fly into space while wearing Armani suits) It's stylish, but the style overwhelms the substance.

{"text": "Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (\"Bum Voyage\" and \"Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?\") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.\n\nHowever, the \"Complete Series\" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.\n\nAnother difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.", "label": 0}

Maybe I lack the \"maturity???\" he has achieved?\n\nNevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.\n\nI even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.\n\nIt hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.\n\nIt just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.\n\nI wanted to buy \"E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial\" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.\n\nNor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the \"live\" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?\n\nAs said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.\n\nThese are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain \"youth junk\".\n\nSorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.\n\nI have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.\n\nPlease take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.\n\nWho made you what you are?\n\nThe Studios? The Executives? The Backers?\n\nOr we, the audience?\n\nThink, and think hard!\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever \"rehash\" of the very same product.\n\nBy the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.\n\nStop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.\n\nIt's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.\n\nI can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?\n\nYou only stand to gain from it.\n\nJust remember what Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n\"You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\"\n\nA bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.\n\nDo not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.\n\nUnfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.\n\nThere are even some, able to read between the lines.\n\nSo, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.\n\nYes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.\n\nKeep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.\n\nForget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.\n\nThis is it.\n\nBuy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.\n\nThere are far better movies around.\n\nThis is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.", "label": 2}
{"text": "93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.\n-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.\n-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\n\n\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\n\"It's worse,\" Latham says.\n\nA short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\n\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"\n\nA wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.\n-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.\n-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.\n-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\n\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\n\"Humbug?\"", "label": 1}

I could understand pairing Steed with a new female partner played by Thurman.  Thurman fails miserably (and embarrasingly) at capturing the essence of a cultural icon of the caliber of Mrs Peel.  I found myself so embarrased watching Thurman stumbling her way in her unconvincing attempt to embody the character of Mrs Peel.  Way to go Uma :-D  The other problem is:  Fiennes is NO Steed.  Gone is the wit and charm, the playful sexuality, and the magical chemistry!  Thumbs down!  Hopefully we'll have something better next time! Meanwhile, hold on to your Mrs Peel Megaset DVD set :-)  Of course, one would say that we, the hard core fans of the TV show, should lighten up.  Issue is that I expect a multimillion project in the form of a film production to open up new vistas, and to throw new light on that landscape we know very well from the TV show.  Thurman, Fiennes, and the script writer of the film were not expected to copy and imitate.  But at least to give us the viewing pleasure of what we came to expect in that experience of watching the TV show.  Instead, we got an infantile love affair, childish sexual gazes that lacked the vagueness and playful complexity of Riggs' Emma and Macnee's Steed, silly lines, and gestures that lacked vitality, and so on and so forth (by comparison, we all know the endings, for example, of 'Too Many Xmas Trees,' 'The Negative Positive Man,' and 'The house that Jack Built,' to name only a few).

{"text": "From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.\nA prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.\nFor Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo.

{"text": "Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review.\nFirst of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring\nanother game title to the bring screen.\nAll movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy,\nMortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!!\nOnce I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck.\nI just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it.\nAfter seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made.\nFurthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game.\nIt does not follow up the story and plot to the games.\nIn fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film.\nTo understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt\nto bring the game to the screen, you have to know the\nstory in Resident Evil games.\nAn evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly\nor willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed\na virus called the \"T virus\".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies.\nEven more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows\nabout the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, \"the scene of the mansion\" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine escape only to be separated . (...)\nBirkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus,\nand is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City.\nThat's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it?\nThe Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil\nThe movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation.\nEverthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a\nchemical container containing the T virus into the\nfloor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that\nUmbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and\ncaptured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them.\nIn fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually\npretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL.\nThis is garbage that is made up. In the Re games,\nthere is no \"Red Queen\" that is causing the killing in\nRacoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought\nupon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover\nit up.  Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero.\nThen comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that\nmost of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella,\nis by a computer called \"The Red Queen\" which\nunleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with\nthe \"T virus\".\nPractically the only part of the game that the movie\nstays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the \"T virus\" which it plans to use for germ warfare.\nHowever, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie.\nEventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she\nis put in the custody) of a group of special police cops ,\nto infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on.\nAdding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation\nis that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.  Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating.\nHowever, that person died, along with the evidence that\nUmbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and\nUmbrella.\nEventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic\nimage of the Red Queen who says \"I've been a very bad girl\".\nLOL. Yeah and I would have added \"I've been a bad actress\nto be in this film too\".\nEventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters....\nBesides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games.\nThe zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but\nhere is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie:\nGiant, poisonous spiders,  killer sharks, 2 arm ferocious hunters, large killer poisonous plants and the over 6ft tall indestructible Tyrants in the game.

Visually the movie looks terrible and shockingly it had a bigger budget than the first movie, never would've guessed that looking at the movie, many times when the zombies appear on screen the picture gets all distorted and the framerate becomes almost like a slideshow, if this was a really low budget movie I would say it was a technical issue but seeing as how it wasn't this was clearly deliberate and why any director would go out of their way to make their movie look as awful as possible is just beyond any logic or coherence. Aside from the that it's also filled with lots of extreme quick cutting, cheap post production looking slow mo, and the action scenes filmed mainly in close ups with quick cutting and shakiness make em utterly unwatchable.\n\nMusic wise it's very bland forgettable techno-ish stuff that lacks the memorable factor of Manson's music from the first movie. For an R rated zombie movie there's not really any blood or gore at all, aside from some F bombs and a few boob shots it feels much more like a PG-13. Aside from Oded Fehr none of the acting is particularily good, even Jovovich is off but I blame the director more than her.

I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.\nSome things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity. I don't think the real Joan comported herself like that--no one would have followed her into battle otherwise.\nAnother problem was that a famous part of the Joan story is that she hears three saints' voices talking to her; they're the ones who inspire her to fight against England's invasion.

It wasn't some evil, nefarious government plot to screw the people. This could've easily been overdone but wasn't.\n\nOverall, it is one of those movies you should watch, I guess. But, you might not get a big \"WOW\" at the end.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I hated this special.  Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love.  Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty.  There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs.  So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network.  Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland?  ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays.  But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.\n\nI do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games.  It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.\n\nMilla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot.  The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done.  Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Michelle Pfeiffer fails to convince me of her grief at losing her son to a kidnapper. She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Very well done.  Overall it's faithful to the Book of Genesis, which it portrays.  Only in a few details it contradicts Genesis, such as:  When Joseph first appears before Pharaoh, the book of Genesis says that he \"shaved,\" implying that he had had a beard before this.  The movie, however, has him clean-shaven throughout.  A serious flaw is that the movie has Joseph's brothers threaten to attack him with spears just before he reveals his identity to them.  Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.\n\nThe scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.  This could have been done better.\n\nIn spite of these and certain other flaws, I give the movie four stars, since it's well done and inspirational.", "label": 1}

{"text": "My mother taped this wonderful holiday classic on VHS when it first aired on TV for me and my brother when we were little and every year around Christmas I would (and still do) watch this holiday classic with my family. So a couple years ago when I saw that they had finally put it on DVD I thought 'Alright it's finally on DVD!' but it was so expensive, even the VHS's were selling for 20 to 40 dollars. So one year after Thanksgiving I started calling every video rental store in town just to see if they had this movie for rent and only one store did. I was really excited about it at first but when I started watching it I noticed that some things were cut out from the movie. Like Fozzy's musical comedy bit with the snowman (It's a very noticeable jump), the muppet home movies (that whole scene was cut out). Miss Piggy musical bit when she finally makes it to the farm house, and a small scene is missing when they do their 'Carol sing'.\n\nI'm glad I only rented it and spent 2 bucks rather then spending more buying it. All I can say is save your money, if you've seen the original 'uncut' version that was aired in the 80's this DVD is not for you.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I'm not sure if it is the inherently poor (relative to modern standards) audio quality of a series shot on videotape in the 1970's, or just my lack of comprehension, but I have found most of the episodes I've watched so far (about thirteen) to range from reasonably intelligible to almost complete gibberish. This is due to the variety of fairly thick British, Irish, and Scots accents. At least one episode -- I think it's titled \"The Swedish Tiger\" -- left me scratching my head trying to figure out exactly what had gone on. The plot was convoluted enough that understanding everything that was said was necessary to grasp more than the basics of the action, and I think I may have gotten every fifth word. It's very frustrating.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Our 20-month-old and 4.5-year-old love this video that contains many of the favorite Bible songs I remember from my childhood.  The music and singing is good quality, and the scenes behind the music are interesting -- children playing, acting out some of the words, like rock climbing during \"Climb up Sunshine Mountain\" -- even a farm full of animals during the Noah song.\n\nUnfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.\n\nStill, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.\n\nTo be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.\n\nLacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.\n\nOf less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.", "label": 2}

{"text": "\"Gattaca\" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" but \"Gattaca\" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors.\n\nAs long as the script sticks to the pseduo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for\n\nits own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty\n\nentertaining film.\n\nGrade: B", "label": 2}
