This vacuum has a basic design that has been the same for decades and it works. I have an older model Eureka that's 41yrs old and still works great!  If you truly want to clean your carpet quick and efficient with no bells and whistles, this is the vacuum for you. It's a great cost effective vacuum that will last for years with proper care. If you have hard floors, I recommend a kenmore canister to do these jobs. You can find one for less than $50 and they work great.", "label": 1}

But I just was thinking it was me.\nWell I all ready getting splits on the one I just put on the old green house. I went to Wal Mart and got a small roll of the 6ml. I could not believe how much more thicker it is.. Some how this is more like a 4ml. So now I have two green houses that I will not even get a year out of this Plastic.

My wife, Bertie Mae has been a suggestin' that I should whiten my tooth and lo and behold I found this here fancy product.  Now I did buy this at a yard sale for .50 cents and I believe most everything was in the box.  The trays had already been molded by the previous owner so I was able to save some time there, and there were 4 of the little tubes in the box, now they'd been opened but the previous owner was nice enough to wrap 'em in a bandaid.  I guess I'm just lucky, or me and the previous owner have about the same shape of mouth because I was able to slide these right in.  It wasn't a real tight custom fit but, heck, what do you expect for .50 cents.\n\nNow I bought this here product to whiten the 1 tooth I have left.  It's on my lower shelf, I call it my snaggle tooth but I don't think that's the real name for it.  Considering the fact I don't need the other tray, if anybody reading this here review wants it, you are welcome to it, just let me know.  My box did not have the instructions so I just kind of winged it and went ahead and filled the tray up to the tippy-top and slid it in, and then fell asleep.  I woke up the next morning with two discoveries.  The first thing was my whole mouth hurt like 60 and the second thing was my darn tooth was just as white as me and Bertie Mae had hoped for.  Heck, my wife even said I'm too handsome now and she wasn't gonna' let me go over to the Piggly-Wiggly by myself because she didn't want the local girls a gawkin' at me.\n\nOverall, this was a not very fun experience but my tooth got white, I paid .50 cents for the treatment and saved time not having to mold the tray as that was done for me by the previous owner.  So I'm going ahead and give it 3 stars.", "label": 2}

The machine suddenly began to spurt scalding hot steam from the handle and hose attachment.  My four year old son was watching from what I thought was a safe distance and his thigh was blasted with hot steam.  Yes, he did suffer a minor, but painful burn.\n\nMy husband then tested the Shark later that evening by filling it, placing it in the middle of room and plugging it in.

{"text": "I researched vacuums for two months before deciding that this was the one I wanted and a big part of that decision was this picture on the website.  The pretty black motor cover and the speckled bag.  It would have complimented the cabinet design of my apartment.  So I was completely disappointed when I opened the box and found the grey model.  It is ugly to me and it does not go with my apartment.  I called Amazon and they were going to send me the exact replacement free of charge.  EXACT REPLACEMENT.  I cancelled that replacement after calling the  Eureka Manufacturer in the manual I got with the grey one and explained that this picture is being showed on various websites that sell the Eureka Upright 1934B. Let me clarify the two pictures, and the problem after talking to the Eureka Representative.\nFirst of all;  the only vacuum Eureka has out in circulation is the grey model that is the 1934B.  End of story.\nThere is no pretty black vacuum with a speckled bag out in circulation.  The picture is being shown on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, & Global Industries.com. A lot of sellers of the Eureka 1934B Upright Vacuum is an ugly grey color and are being shown as a pretty black vacuum with a speckled bag.  Although after looking more closely at the Amazon Website it does show you at the bottom of the page the grey model that you will get delivered.\nI UPLOADED A PICTURE OF THE VACUUM you will receive when ordering from this Web Page.  Just look at my Profile Picture (Product2review).  I did that for reviewers so you would know what you are ordering and what will be delivered as of 12/03/2013.\nThe vacuum works great; very strong suction and can even get sand off of the tiled floor with ease.  It works, and is well-worth the money even though I am disappointed with the way it looks; and all the websites that are showing this pretty black vacuum with the speckled bag.  I wanted an upright and had the grey one saved in my (saved for later cart) on Walmart.com then I saw this pretty picture.  So I can't say that I probably would not have bought the ugly grey one, because like I said I researched  100's of vacuums and The Eureka stood up to its name until the end (THE BOSS), it has everything I wanted in an upright without all the extras.  Just a strong, simple, light-weight vacuum that you plug into the wall and vacuum; then your done.\nThere is no attachments to put away because the 1934B DOES NOT come with attachments and CANNOT use them that is what the Representaive said.\nOh, and by the way, if you turn the vacuum on and walk away it moves across the carpeting by itself, that is what I call a good vacuum.\n\nI just realized something and thought I would bring this to the attention of review readers.\nBuyer Beware.... that some of these reviews or pictures are from years ago.... A review or picture from 2006 Model Number is not going to have the same color vacuum or picture of a 2013 model number.  Call Eureka 1-800-282-2886 to make sure of the Color and whether or not it takes attachments for the model number you have chosen.\nThis is the telephone number in the Owners Guide of the 1934B  For all Upright  Eureka  Vacuums  in  the 1400-1900 Series", "label": 1}

I didn't realize there was such a long wait time for it to cure, but after a couple weeks it took the primer and paint just fine and it looks great!  Better, in fact, than the pane adjacent to it so I may have to do that one as well. Luckily the weather will be in the 60's so I think this will go a little more quickly this time around.

{"text": "Received my \"hangup\" vacuum a few weeks ago.  I used it for some light duty vacuuming down in the basement.  After putting up a wall and cutting drywall I figured I'd use it to vacuum the dust and pieces of drywall on the floor.  It does great with dust, but who vacuums dust with a shop vac?  Unfortunately the hose is too small (narrow) and since the hose is so long it clogs VERY easily.  And when it clogs it overheats.  After about the 10th clog I packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.  I instead ordered the 6.5 peak horsepower model (925-42-10) for $99.99 (has a 2.5\" hose instead of this rinky dink one).  It's MUCH quieter, MUCH stronger, and has not clogged even once.  I'm giving this two stars because I am disappointed with the power, noise, size of the hose, and pretty much everything else about the vacuum.  The only good thing is the variety of attachments you get.  But who can vacuum with an attachment that only gives you an opening of about 1/2\" (crevice tool)??

I've used GG (and other brands of the same type of glue - which, incidentally, seem to be identical to the point that I don't really have a preference) for countless things over the years:  I repaired the broken frame of a Nordictrack skier that developed a crack (I glued the crack and clampled it, as well as glueing and screwing a piece of wood to the side, along the crack and a few inches beyond on either side), put a kickboard on the screen door of our front door which is starting to deteriorate at the lower corner, built a small playhouse ladder, and about a million other things I can't recall.\n\nIt works well and bonds seem to be very strong.  I generally use glue as a supplement, not as the only source of bonding (if possible).  I've repaired some non-wood items as well.  Some have worked fine, some not.  As another review mentions, you can peel the dried glue off of the nozzle when you're opening it for another use - so it's probably not the best choice for plastics.  I've done some ceramics and it's been fine - the foaming as it dries can of course make the end results look less-than-perfect.\n\nOverall GG is very useful, and there are plenty of things for which it works very well and where, say, super glue doesn't do the trick.  I don't know if it's better than wood glue for wood projects.  From what I hear it's not, but I don't always have wood glue around, so I'll use this.\n\nThe most important advice I can give is: don't buy too big of a bottle unless you really use it a lot.  When you're done using it, squeeze as much air out of the bottle as you can.  I've never been able to actually finish a bottle of this kind of glue, because as I get to the last third or so, it usally hardens or there's so much dried glue at the top of the bottle that I have to cut apart the bottle to get to the remaining glue.  Squeezing out as much air as possible before closing the cap will mitigate this to a large degree, but at some point you just can't get enough air out and so you start to see the crusty, hardened end of the life of your precious bottle of glue somewhere on the horizon.  It's the circle of life.  For glue, anyway.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Okay, this is not an industrial fryer,  let's just get that out of the way.  The place I work, took out it's fryer probably over 10 to 15 years ago and have never looked back.  Cut his insurance significantly and they did not use it enough for it not to be a hassle when it was used.  However, no matter what anyone says, some things just need to be deep fried, there is not good substitute for example, mozzarella sticks. We have tried doing them with a kettle on the stove, home frier and purchased products that we were guaranteed could be done in the oven.  We have made our own and pre fried them then finished them in the oven and we have made ones that we did in the oven from beginning to the end.  There is just no substitute.  We had a wedding to serve that was very upscale but mozzarella sticks are the grooms favorite so we needed to do something.  I did not want to spend a lot of money on a tool that would not get that much use but from past experiences knew any of the fryers you get that use a gallon or less of oil are useless for mass production.  I decided on this one after reading the reviews.\n\nUnboxing and set up are easy.  Be careful, this is not high grade stainless steel not matter the specs listed.  The insert that hold the grease is like a a medium quality hotel pan. It got up to temp quickly and maintained heat well.  The fryer basket holds a 2# bag of moz sticks perfectly and they fried beautifully.  Clean up is easy and it fits nicely on our ss work table.\n\nI do not think this unit will take abuse or a lot of hard use well but if you treat it respectfully and with the knowledge that it is not an industrial fryer, there is no reason it should not work for some time and work well.", "label": 1}

Only draw backs I have found are: #1 the edges are VERY sharp, like razor blade sharp, barely brushing against them can cause a significant cut.  #2 Although it is easily moveable, it is slightly large for a home kitchen and can be a bit heavy when loaded w/oil - so this makes storage in the home kitchen a bit difficult.

All these whitening products you see on tv are displayed by actors and models who have brilliant white teeth to start, having had thousands of dollars worth of cosmetic dental work done. That's the bait. They never show an average joe putting whitening strips or trays in their mouth. This product isn't even made in the USA, it's made in Canada and imported. This product contains a known caustic bleaching agent, hydrogen peroxide, that can and has caused adverse reactions, such as blistering and whitening of the gums, severe swelling of the lips, burns and sores in the lining of the mouth, extreme sensitivity of the teeth and tongue pain when used over a two hour period. This product is not FDA regulated for quality assurance, safety or efficacy, and is not endorsed or recommended by the American Dental Association. When it comes to putting a caustic bleaching agent in your mouth for two hours, you're taking a big risk that could land you at the dentist with a large bill to reverse the damage caused by this product, far beyond what it would have cost had you scheduled a regular exam and cleaning in the first place. For safety's sake, use common sense. If your teeth are stained or yellow, go to a dentist. They are trained in mixing cleaning preparations for the teeth that will not harm delicate mouth tissue. They often use a stannous flouride treatment along with cleaning. This seals the teeth and prevents tooth sensitivity after cleaning.

{"text": "This is a very effective and powerful glue when used carefully and properly. It expands (foams) when it cures -- great at filling gaps. It is flexible after curing. It doesn't smell. It can be trimmed with a sharp knife after curing. It really sticks well to just about everything (except polyethylene). It cures enough to stop clamping in 2 hours, completely in 24. It is very good for making or repairing a paperback book binding if you are careful. Using masking tape (the sticky side) or wax paper can be useful to block the glue from gluing/sticking to surfaces (both peel away from the glue afterwards).\n\nThe instructions advise you to push excess air out of the bottle before closing -- this can be a bit difficult. This is to exclude water vapor as reacting with water on what you are gluing or from the air is what makes the glue cure.\n\nEpoxy is better if you need a hard rigid strong bond. Cyanoacrylic (\"super glue\") is better if you need a strong bond in a very tight space (like cracked china). White & yellow \"Elmer's\" glue is best for paper and normal wood joints. This glue is best if you need to fill gaps, glue difficult materials, need flexibility, need something very durable (waterproof, doesn't dry out/crack), and don't mind having some glue foam out of the joint at times (this is easy to trim back).

{"text": "I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago? I don't remember. The technology clearly works. My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque. I have never used any of the other \"sonic\" toothbrushes. I imagine they work as well.\n\nMy original Sonicare just started acting up. It still works, but I think the battery is dying. So I bought the e7300. First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless \"features\" so they can engage in marketing hype and jack up the price. It looks to be more cheaply made. I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit. It looks to me like it was designed to fail.\n\nI was annoyed by the very first page of the manual. It tells me to make sure the handle is properly seated in the base, because if it is put in wrong, the charging light may still come on, but it won't charge. What kind of engineering is this? If it's not charging, don't turn the light on. Don't they have engineers smart enough to figure that out? So I tested it. Sure enough, you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on. This is just lazy or careless design work.\n\nWorse, the base is too small, too light, and too shallow. In the original unit, the handle goes well over an inch into the base and there is only one way it will fit. With this unit, the base only holds the handle by about a half inch so it's easy to put it in wrong. And sure enough, no matter how you put it in, even half falling out, the charging light lights up. Looks like it was designed by the marketing department?\n\nThen there's the idiotic 2-minute shutoff. I can see zero benefits and several disadvantages. First of all, why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes? Do they think I might leave it on or am too lazy to turn it off myself. This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.\n\nBut that's not the most annoying problem. You do NOT want to take the thing out of your mouth while it is running or you will spray toothpaste and spit everywhere. After a few uses, I am operating on autopilot. When I finish brushing, I click the on/off button to turn it off and remove it from my mouth in one simultaneous motion. If you happen to finish brushing just as the thing shuts off (after 2 minutes), clicking the on/off button will actually turn it back on as you are removing it from your mouth. Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror, the sink, your shirt, the wall, the floor... Nice. #@$%#$@!!! I have done this a few times. Not good.\n\nPersonally, I find the \"timer signal\" every 30 seconds annoying, too. I just want a simple on/off button. It's a toothbrush, not the control panel for a heart-lung machine. KISS. Actually, I have no problem with this \"feature\" if some people are unable to figure out how to brush without a built-in timer as long as the company provides a way to turn the infernal thing off. But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.\n\nIn the original model, I could at least turn off the 30-second reminders by holding the on/off button for a few seconds -- simple. With this \"improved\" model, they have added a \"dual speed\" button, but it only works while in the charger. Now that's convenient. I have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way. Now I have to move the charger to where I can actually see it. My guess is that they are again protecting me from myself so I won't accidentally change the settings while I am using the unit. Did they test this on morons? Did they test it at all?\n\nThe ultimate insult to injury is in the instructions on recycling the battery. I am told to first deplete the battery. I am to do this by removing the unit from the charger, turning it on, and letting it run until it stops. But it stops every 2 minutes! Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks (twice a day) on a full charge, they are really asking me to stand there for an hour (2x2x14 minutes) and restart the unit 28 times. Like that is going to happen.\n\nOn the bright side, it comes with a very nice travel case. I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit, which is probably why it broke and I bought this piece of junk.\n\nSummary: The technology works. This unit was designed to fail early so that you would buy a new one. I give it 3 stars for cleaning teeth and 0 stars for arrogant, cheap design and being overpriced.\n\n07/30/10 I have since junked this thing and bought an Oral B Sonic Complete. (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Oral-B-S-320-Sonic-Complete-Rechargeable-Power-Toothbrush/dp/B0002M50Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush</a>) What a difference. The Oral B is well designed (with one minor annoyance) and it cleans better. I have a mouth guard. I clean it every morning. It had become yellowed over the years. After a few days with the Oral B, it has lost most of the yellowing. I am downgrading the Sonicare to a 1 in comparison to the Oral B. Check it out.", "label": 0}

{"text": "UPDATED REVIEW:\nI gave it one star to begin with, and now wish I could give it zero.  It broke after less than one year of minimal use (I disliked the Eureka vacuum so much that I purchased a different vacuum to use instead, and used this one only on occasion for quick pickups since the other vacuum is a canister vacuum, not an upright).  Horrible customer service from Eureka.  Was a longtime Eureka customer (and told them so, but they didn't care), and will never buy another Eureka product again.  Bought a Bissell (canister vacuum) and love it.  I bought the Bissell with the intention of using it to clean baseboards, upholstery, etc, but wound up using it to vacuum the carpet too.\n\nI mentioned this below in the comments to my review, but it bears repeating here: I had a previous version of the Eureka Boss and really liked it.  Eureka  changed the vacuum substantially but kept the name and raised the price.\n\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI did a lot of research (not enough apparently) before buying this vacuum.  I was looking for a Eureka vacuum that was similar to the previous ones we've owned.  Eureka's own website led me to believe that this vacuum had a place for attachments.  It was not necessary that the vacuum itself come with attachments, as long as the attachments from my old Eureka uprights fit this model (since they have all been interchangeable in the past; and if not, I would have been willing to purchase new attachments).  This vacuum was a complete waste of money for me.  Now we need to spend even more money so that I can purchase a vacuum with attachments.  Eureka makes one, but I'm not sure I want to give them any more money.\n\nAlso, I am not in love with this vacuum even if I consider just its intended purpose.  I will update this review with more details when I get a chance.\n\nI seem to be the only person on here who did not realize that this vacuum had no place for attachments.  Even the manual that comes with it, has an order form for the attachments.\n\nBut that aside, I will say that for a vacuum that does only one thing, I expect much more for the price.  It has many flaws that I will list when I get a chance to update this review.  Because of this, I think that this vacuum would still have been overpriced (compared to what we've paid in the past for other bagged upright Eureka vacuums), even if it had come with attachments or had a place to attach them.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I purchased Delta's 10-inch benchtop drill press last year and quickly learned that a drill press vise would be a must-have accessory.  I first purchased a generic, \"universal-fit\" drill press vise, but it didn't fit the table properly.  The mounting holes of the vise didn't align with the mounting holes on the drill press table.  I returned the vise and decided to buy the appropriate Delta model vise for my press.  Contacting Delta, this is the model they said would fit my drill press.  When the vise arrived I was surprised to encounter the same problem.  Once again, the mounting holes/slots didn't line up.  I complained to Delta and their response was pretty lame.  They said the vise would still work fine if it was mounted to the table at an angle.  Furthermore, it would not be cost-efficient for them to make a vise which perfectly fit every model of drill press.  Excuse me, but wouldn't it be a simple matter to machine the holes and slots on the drill press table to accomodate the slots on the vise?!  I don't get Delta's flimsy explanation.  Anyway, I'm sure this vise is of good quality and will do the job it's meant to do, but if you order it for your drill press, you may not be able to expect it to fit the way you think it will.  When mounting the vise to the table on an angle as Delta suggests, it looks and \"feels\" odd.  In addition, you can't achieve the same amount of adjustability with it as if it were mounted properly.  Delta needs to re-think its engineering and tooling strategies so its products are more compatible with each other.", "label": 2}

The nails were themselves in a fairly rugged box with cardboard padding inside the box already.  Then they were in yet another box, with more cardboard padding, that was labeled on the outside with product information.

{"text": "I do not recommend this product at all! To start, I do not have any known allergies, I don't have sensitive skin at all, I've never reacted to any chemicals. I have tried other teeth whitening products before.\nI read all the instructions carefully prior to starting, and kept referring to the instructions while I was doing the steps. It is a very easy set up and very easy to use. My teeth absolutely became noticeably whiter.\n\nIt very clearly states not to put the gel on your lips and gums. Each application, I was very careful to avoid putting the gel on my lips or gums and even wiped with a towel for good measure. I made it to the last session when my gums started to feel weird. It was a very dull pain, but I hadn't felt it until the last session and towards the end of my 20 minute time.\n\nIt has now been two days and my lower gums are in SO MUCH PAIN!! It is painful to eat, painful to talk, painful to touch. If the paid doesn't go away in another day, I'm going to seek medical attention. I will update my review.\n\nSo, this product did whiten my teeth, but also gave me immense gum pain. Not worth it to me at all.", "label": 0}

I used just enough gel (there is probably enough in each tube for both trays) and removed extra gel if it came into contact with my gums.

{"text": "I purchased these because I am doing most of my restoration work myself.  There are some good points and bad.  The bad:  The top and bottom caps pop off continuously.  If the poles drop they fly off.  When I go to release the tension from the top of the pole, it slides down fast, popping off both of the cap and the round piece (used to allow the top to swivel).  One time when I released the pressure, the pole extension dropped and went into the pole itself, the spring flew off and the clip that allows the poles to extend got smashed, I spent 1/2 hour taking the thing apart and trying to reassemble it.\n\nThese are a good idea and have helped me out, I have saved time building my own, but they are not the best quality.  When I received the poles, some parts were missing and there were no instructions.  (I did not take off points for that as it is not manufactures fault, but this is becoming pretty common when purchasing things through Amazon)  I went to youtube to see what some of the parts were and found a lot of instruction on how to repair these poles.  That kind of tells you something.\n\nThe good:  if you are working by yourself they will save you time and some frustration (except when you have to reassemble them)  I have found that I have to attach the poles  by wire to something so they won't fall over, I am installing framing on a ceiling and using 9 foot boards so I have to tie one of the poles to one ladder then to another ladder then put up board.  The best part is  the  hand adjustment, you just squeeze the handle and you get a final adjustment.  But if you try to put any type of pressure on it, it stops working, due to the plastic pieces.  You can make things snug but not overly tight.\nIf you are going it alone these are a good option, but there are some limitation.  There needs to be a safety on the top cap so the rod does not fall into the pole, itself.  Top and bottom caps need to stay on better.", "label": 2}

It takes a lot longer than 2 minutes (around 5 minutes or more) for me to brush properly with this brush and cover all tooth surfaces. When I am done, my teeth do feel \"squeaky clean\", a feeling that would require a ton more brushing with regular non-electric brushes. I don't like the automatic indicator feature on this brush that indicates when to stop brushing a particular side and switch to the other side. The brush actually stops spinning for a second and it feels like an interruption to me.  I am almost NEVER done when the indicator comes on to give the signal for a switch.\n\nBrushing with the electric brush is MESSY - way more messy than brushing with a regular brush. A number of other reviewers have complained about the difficult cleaning of this brush. I have no such issues. I simply take the whole brush head part off the brush base and rinse both the brush head and the metal base that holds the brush head in the water before leaving them on my bathroom counter to dry. Recharging takes an entire day but when fully charged, I can use the brush for nearly a week (once a day) before the red-light-indicator for recharging comes on.\n\nOverall I am happy with this brush.

When I finished tuning it, finally getting the blade square and pulley's aligned, it was still a 'nickel launcher' rather than anything you could consider smooth.  I took off the drive belt and took a closer look and found that it was about 30% thicker at the splice.\n\nSo I KNEW the PTP would help...KNEW it would solve much of the problem.  And it did... beautifully.  I doubt it would start and stop with a nickel standing on it (at 3hp it snaps to life) but there's no vibration now while it's running.\n\nBUT BEWARE:  I bought my PTP in spring, but in Texas, without air conditioning, it's not very enticing to work in my shop during the hottest part of the summer, so I tend to only rush in and out to do small jobs.  I walked in the other day and found I'd left the blade all the way up, which leaves full tension on the belt, and since the motor is heavy and spring loaded, it had stretched the belt and was sitting at the bottom of the range.  I lowered the blade height and oops... no blade spin.\n\nSoooo, I took the belt off and removed a link and she's good as new, but I'll have to remember to run the blade all the way down each time so it doesn't happen again!

The next day by teeth were a little sensitive but nothing to painful, however, my bottom gums and the inside of my lower lip (where your lip connects to your gums) were very red and painful. I examined it and noticed that my lip looked like it was missing skin. The whitening dissolved some of my skin off! I know it says to avoid skin, but there is no way you can completely avoid your gums, otherwise you won't whiten all of your teeth. Im happy with the whitening but I would never buy this product again. I hurts for me to eat because chewing rubs my lip against my gums. I would recommend the whitening strips because you don't have to worry about overflow of product and you have better control over it.\n\nI do not have sensitive teeth and have never thought of myself as having a sensitive mouth. I have used whitening stripes many times before and never had any problems like i did with the trays.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I chose this vacuum over other similarly priced models because of all the great reviews here.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed was how LIGHT the box was.  As I was assembling the handle the ONE bolt that holds the handle to the foot stripped (because it was junky) so the handle is wobbly. I noticed the brush had only ONE line of bristles around it, and overall the vacuum was extremely LIGHT which meant it wasn't going to be able to press down into the carpet well enough to get it very clean.  The \"ON\" switch is a large button you have to stomp on and it doesn't work very well; the handle release is also not very easy to use, you have to really stomp on it to get it to release, so it is just a matter of time until it breaks.  The suction on the machine is about a 3 out of 10. It did NOT leave good brush marks on the carpet and I had to go back over most areas 3-4 times before I was satisfied that they were as clean as this very poor machine could get them.  The only positive thing I can say is that it is on the quiet side, probably because of its low amps and poor suction.\n\nI cleaned houses while I was in school and this is quite possibly the cheapest, most junky vacuum cleaner I've ever had the misfortune to use.  I would send it back right now if I could. Steer clear.", "label": 0}

{"text": "A review based on use with mortar, bricks and paving slabs.\n\nMy mother has a wisteria in a brick planter / rockery, constructed from semi engineering bricks topped with cut paving slabs all the way around. This was built around 3 years ago and all the cut slabs had become loose.\n\nNow in an ideal world, I would have simply removed all the mortar and stuck back down with fresh mortar. The problem with this method is a possibility of breaking a slab when chipping off the mortar and the fact that the slabs she bought at the time were end of the line and are no longer available.\n\nIn the past with this sort of situation, I would have just removed the slab dusted the mortar and stuck back down with weather proof exterior PVA glue. Ive done this several times over the years and it has always dried solid and firm in a day or two and years later each slab is still stuck down. However, repairing a single loose slab is a rather different prospect to doing several adjoining slabs in one go with PVA. It has no grab and takes an age to set which can easily result in movement and is susceptible to the effects of the weather.\n\nIn fact, if I were to have done this I would probably have done one slab per day, waiting for the previous to have dried before doing this next. As such I needed something to do the job that dried quickly to enable me to do it all in one day, and after a little searching I decided upon Gorilla Glue.\n\nBased on my experience with the glue I would offer the following observations.\n\nGorilla glue is carcinogenic, it does not state this anywhere on the product information about this so be warned.\n\nThe glue is a slightly viscous but very runny liquid that looks like Rowse honey, and if you apply the glue vertically it will run, if you apply on the underside of something it will drip.\n\nThe best way to describe this glue is to compare it to Soudal fixing foam thats super concentrated and had all the moisture removed that gets activated and foams by adding water. If applied as per the instructions it starts to expand within about 15 mins and continues to do so for over an hour. I strongly advise that you should babysit your work until it is fully cured.\n\nThe product description states that the glue expands 3 times its size, the bottle states that it expands to 3-4 times its size, the fact is it expands to more like 6-8 times its size. I used on top of bricks to adhere a slab on top, in this situation a thin bead in the middle of the brick not going within 1 of the edges is the optimal solution.\n\nAnything that the glue comes into contact with while in liquid form (brick, mortar, slabs, skin) will turn black. If you get the glue on anything not intended use white spirit and a nylon brush to remove, this will sadly not prevent black staining but it appears that white spirit makes the glue inert and prevents it from foaming and  removes the glue from the surface.\n\nWhen gluing the 3rd slab down I suffered a glue run which covered almost an entire brick, I managed to clean it off quickly enough, but the brick went black, I tried to jet wash, then scrubbed with soap, then white spirit and in desperation tried muriatic acid twice and nothing worked, I just ended up with a slightly faded and mostly black brick.\n\nWhen the glue is dry it can be treated in the same way as expanding foam, it can be cut, sanded and filled if required.\n\nSO HOW STRONG IS IT ?\n----------------------------------\nThis glue has no initial grab; it is not that sort of glue. The items being glued can easily be manipulated for up to 30-45 mins after applying the glue, I would advise against doing so after 15 mins however, and is rock solid within 2 hours.\n\nRoughly 2 hours after applying I yanked the corner of one of the slabs upwards with all my strength, while Im no weight lifter at 61, a 44 chest and weighing 17 stone I consider myself stronger than average. This amount of force would easily have disjointed a slab laid with mortar, yet the slab held down with gorilla glue did not budge.\n\nSince it has been in place it has suffered torrential rain, 24c direct sunlight and several nights of ground frost and I am glad to say is as secure as the day it dried.\n\nSEPERATING THE GLUE.\n----------------------------------\nThe day after I had laid all the slabs back on top of the planter I found that one was uneven, and I did not want to leave it as it was. Being very careful with a 4lb hammer and masons chisel I was able to separate the bond, I started at one end with a few taps, and worked my way around to the other edge and then went back to the start and repeated until it came loose.\n\nGiven the strength of the glue I would seriously advise against just taping the chisel through in one place until the slab comes loose as it is a very real possibility that if you do you will crack the slab in half. I would compare it trying to remove a large ceramic tile intact from a wall that has been stuck on with decent adhesive.\n\nPROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.\n-------------------------------------\nWear gloves, I used a pair of latex gardening gloves and they protected my hands fine, at first I wore a pair of latex gloves underneath but found it was not necessary. If you get any glue on your gloves, pour a tiny bit of white spirit on the glove and rub the palms together and this will prevent transfer to anything you are handling.\n\nWear a long sleeve top, I did not and even as careful as I was I still got a tiny blob on my arm, if this happens to you use white spirits to remove and then wash with soap and water.\n\nWear a dust mask, I was using the glue outside in the open and used a P3 mask that filters 99.95% of airborne particles yet still suffered throat irritation for several days after use.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n--------------------\nThis is a hard one, the adhesive properties of Gorilla glue are undeniable, but not without cost. This stuff is exceptionally hazardous and there is no amount of pressure, money or other incentive that would make me use this indoors ever.\n\nI would strongly advise against using in a situation where should it run, it would ruin the finish of the items being worked on.\n\nGiven the same situation again, I would use my old tried and tested method of weather proof PVA for the job, there is just no way that I would consider using this again, the risks just outweigh the benefits it offers.\n\nIf I were to review based on my experience I would only give it 3/5, however I can see that it has many useful uses that I would consider it for in future should the need arise. I would go so far as to recommend keeping a small bottle handy in the shed as I can not think of a better product for emergency weatherproofing repairs in the middle of a storm.\n\nAs such I am more than happy to give it a 4/5, as it does do nearly everything it says on the tin.\n\nThis has admittedly been a rather one sided review based on my use thus far I do hope however that you have found some part of this review of use and I wish you well in your upcoming projects.", "label": 1}

After reading the back of it, it mentions that due to the chemicals used, they will release gas and cause the tube to expand, which is nothing to worry about; however, upon opening the lid to my first tube, the pressure inside the tube forced about 1/3rd of toothpaste in the tube out and into my sink. I haven't gotten to my 2nd tube yet, and maybe there's a way to get the gas to accumulate at the top of the tube before opening it, but there was no warning on the package that this could/would occur and frankly it will be pretty annoying if it does it for the remaining tubes. I'm sure someone will comment with \"It never happens to me, you must be opening it wrong\", but besides randomly massaging the tube trying to get gas to the top, there's not much else I can do to prevent it.\n\nSo, not only is this toothpaste more expensive than other brands (maybe justifiably so) keep in mind that there is the potential for a large percentage of the toothpaste to uncontrollably exit when you first open it, thereby increasing the cost of the toothpaste even further. If anyone has found a way to prevent this from occurring, I'd love to hear it before I open my remaining tubes.\n\nUPDATE on 5/1/2012 - I opened the 2nd tube some time ago and was able to prevent toothpaste from exiting by massaging it around and getting all of the gas near the opening. Unfortunately, I no longer use this toothpaste. After making it through the first tube and part of the second, I started to notice a trend of bad breath and a funny taste in my mouth. The taste in my mouth was similar to hydrogen peroxide and I made the assumption that this was also the cause of my bad breath. I switched to some cheap Crest from my local department store and the bad breath slowly went away. I'll see if I can get my girlfriend to use the rest of it. :)", "label": 0}

{"text": "We have used the cordless toothbrushes for decades.  This one rates as OK for one reason only.  The motor runs the brush head rather slow compared to the competition.  They must do this for a reason/purpose but after using the Oral-B's I prefer the old Oral-B's.  The one great aspect of this tooth brush is the heads it uses.  They are fat, varied texture to hit the spots and crevasses and goes deeper than the Oral-B's do.  Unfortunately the heads are specific to this brush.  I would love this brush head with the Oral-B's power.  Again, not sure why they made it this way as the faster spin is a great massage on the gum while brushing.  whoever decides that a weaker/slower motor was where to save money made a mistake.  Oral-B customers that moved away thinking this top brand would be good will return to Oral-B the next purchase.  And in case you wonder if this one was a fluke I returned the original believing it was defective.  The replacement was the exact same. Great head, mediocre performance.", "label": 2}
{"text": "Building a house by all by myself, in a developing country where labor is let's just say not very laborious. Even if I had a big crew of men, I would still prefer these as they allow for fine adjustments at my own pace.\n\nThese puppies rule. I can lift a 30 foot or larger segment of wall, with osb on, while drinking a cup of coffee and enjoying the view. 40 foot long is as brave as I have gotten with no sheathing. I am getting more confident in them, so I have a 48 foot lift coming up fully sheathed, but will still use some backup supports for that one just in case.\n\nI could not find a 2x4 that length, but was able to buy a 2x6 and rip it down. when they say 3.5 inches, they mean, 3.5 inches. I cut my 2x4 to 3 3/4 at first, but it ended up binding as it lifted, which is spooky to have tap with a hammer to get them going again while under a 1,000 pounds or so. Never an indication however that they might slip back, or fail.\n\nI have two different lengths of pipe handle. One is about 5 feet long to help keep you out of the \"kill zone\" longer until the wall is mostly in a stable upright position.\n\nI also bought the wind hooks, and the floor plates. the floor plates are totally worth it as you try to position this super tall piece of 2x4 by yourself with one hand. the wind hooks, you could likely just get by with a piece of cable and a simpson strong tie to do the same thing. Still, nice to have. I don't hesitate to lift walls on a really windy day.\n\nso happy, bought the pump jacks for scaffolding from them, and their roofing hooks.\n\ncons, but not sufficient to drop a star at this price: the paint sucks on all their products, and they do rust. That said, I would expect my grand kids to finally replace them due to the thickness of the metal. the rust is cosmetic. give them a wd-40 bath for long-term storage. the bolts could use some lock washers, or at least check they are tight before each lift. they do tend to loosen up.", "label": 1}

This glue may give accuracy, but speed is questionable and the end result is sub par.  It does leave a stain and it does leave allot of work after it has dried.  My recomendation is to use a good yellow glue like titebond which gives a superior joint and it is easy to work with all around.\n\nSo in summation think about the end result that you wish to achieve with this glue because it does have its place, but furnature construction is not one of them.", "label": 1}

I am in the middle of rebuilding our home, after losing our original one to fire in late 2010, I read about these in a book from Taunton Press on Home Construction. I was able to erect 10' 2\"x6\" framed walls 25'-45' in length complete with OSB siding installed using only three people (one for a tagline). Absolutely incredible!\nI raised the walls on a slab, so I had to use a different method than the instructions cover. Due to having already stained the concrete floors, they are essentially finished, and I couldn't use concrete fasteners to attach the bottoms of the jacks to the floor. In order to keep the jacks from kicking out from under the wall in the middle of the lift, I built a couple of small wood \"sleds\" for the jack bases to ride on. I tied the \"sled\" to the bottom of the walls with 1/4\" steel cables, via a 3/4\" hole drilled in the center of & about 4\" from the bottom of the 2x6 stud inline with the jack. I propped the bases of the walls up with blocks in order to clear the anchor bolts, and they dropped right down on them. We use a 12# sledge to bump the base of wall into final position over the bolts, then removed the blocks. It worked great. Be sure to use a tag line, or some other way to stop over-travel. The wall will tend to try to fall away from the jack into and beyond the vertical position when it gets to within about 10 degrees from plumb at the end of the lift.\nAlso VERY important!! Be sure the 2x4\" used for the jack posts are flawless!! No knots or cross grained wood. You need very straight grain. These posts will have a lot of load on them, especially at the halfway part of the lift. Failure of one post will likely cause failure of the other one and at the very least damage your wall and possibly smash someone like a flyswatter. So be careful always stay out from under overhead loads.\nIf used correctly these things are awesome.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is a nice tool for use with an AC clamp meter for measuring AC currents.  There are two places one can put the clamp meter.  One is the  \"1X\" position, and the clamp meter will measure the actual current.  The other is the \"10X\" position, and the clamp meter will measure 10 times the actual current.  This is especially useful for measuring small currents.  I've had this line splitter for a few weeks now, and have used it many times.  The one problem I've had is that one of the 120 volt sockets does not always make a good connection - not sure which one.  This is sometimes a small nuisance, and then one just plays with the connections for a second and all is well.  Sometimes it is more of a pain.  For example, I was just doing measurements of the current carried by an attic fan.  My wife was downstairs watching the clamp meter for me while I was in the attic turning the fan on and off.  The attic fan was working, and then all of a sudden it wasn't working.  I didn't know if I had tripped a circuit breaker or what.  So, I got down from the attic, and tried wiggling the contacts to the Extech - I heard the fan come on.  At least, I've learned to check it first if there are problems.  It's a good and useful tool, but it does have this quirk.  Maybe yours will not.  Incidentally, I am an electrical engineer.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I only write reviews if a product is exceptionally good or really bad.  This is one of the bad ones.\n\nThe description on Amazon says that these work with doors up to 1 3/8 inch thick.  On the actual package, they are made for doors up to 1 1/8 inch thick.  The package is correct.  With my custom made 1 3/8 inch thick doors, I had to move the mounting points over by 1/8 of an inch to prevent the corners of the door from hitting the door jamb.\n\nSpeaking of mounting points, if you follow the included instructions, the bottom of your doors will be 1/16 of an inch closer to the jamb than the tops, resulting in a 1/8\" uneven gap between the two mounted doors.  Another modification by moving the bottom mounting points out 1/16 to make the doors plumb.\n\nI am a custom woodworker with many years of experience.  Luckily I have the know how to do a test mount on scrap first.  If I had not done this, the custom saloon doors that I just made would be ruined with incorrect mounting holes.  Some epoxy and sanding later, I could have corrected the problem, but this should not be necessary.\n\nIf you are purchasing these hinges, be sure to do a test mount first to determine if they will work for your application.\n\nHere are my modified instructions for those that are interested:\n\nThe edge of the top hinge that attaches to the door should be 7/16\" as stated for doors up to 1 1/8\" thick.  For doors up to 1 3/8 thick, change this to 5/16\"\n\nThe edge of the bottom hinge that attaches to the door should be 1/4\" instead of the stated 5/16\" for doors up to 1 1/8\" thick. This will ensure that the doors have an even gap between the jamb.  For doors up to 1 3/8\" thick, change this to 1/8\" instead of 1/4\".\n\nThe mounting instructions for the jamb side are the same as the instruction manual.  There are also slots on one of the hinges for adjustment though this is never mentioned in the instructions.\n\nThe flat head screws are used in the recessed holes and the round head are used for the other holes.  This may seem like common sense, but should also be mentioned in the instructions as some people may not know this.\n\nI have not yet mounted them the doors jambs, just a test piece.  With the test piece, the doors only return to center when opened one direction.  I am hoping that this is because my test piece is not plumb and level.  If they work the same after the final mounting, I will update this review.\n\nOverall, the product seems to be OK, but the instructions are very poor and could ruin a set of doors if a test fit was not done first.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I purchased the Steam Fast SF-275 and did not get what I was expecting. After doing a lot of research on steam cleaners, I thought this one would be great. First, it is misleading to state that this product has on-board storage. Its tiny store compartment barely holds the little brushes it comes with and they get really hot because the storage is on top of the heating element. Below I will state the pros and cons of the unit. This product is not all bad; it just wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nPros:\n Rolls on wood/tile floors well\n Puts out decent for cleaning minimally dirty surfaces (floors/countertops); but doesnt consume enough power/pressure to clean major areas (dirty grout)\n\nCons:\n There is NOWHERE to store the power cord. You can't even wrap it around the unit and expect it to stay.\n There is no storage for ANY of the accessories except for the 6 little brushes. It would be hard not to eventually lose some of the parts.\n It has NO low water indicator\n The handle gets pretty hot while in use; wear a glove.\n Doesn't work very well on ovens, probably due to the 36 PSI.\n The squeegee is supposed to also be a garment steamer, but that is impossible.  The squeegee practically pours out  water. I'm not sure if mine is broken or if that is the way it was made.\n You can't refill the unit until it is shut off and cools down (30+ minutes).\n There is no way to control the amount of steam the unit produces; you cannot increase/decrease the amount of steam that comes out.\n The cloth used with the floor attachment barely stays on.\n\nOverall, if you want something to do light cleaning with, this would be a great product. I was expecting something that could really cut through some extremely dirty surfaces, but could also steam garments, but that is not what I got.", "label": 2}

The plastic cans have one key advantage however: they are not painted!\n\nI purchased one of these cans about a month ago to replace the one I've been using for my lawn mower and filled it with out issue. Other than filling the tank of my lawnmower once every weekend It's not seen much in the way of work. I haven't even re-filled it yet! This past weekend when I went to fill my tank, I happened to notice (thankfully before I started pouring) that there were red paint flakes around the rubber gasket. Not sure why the manufacturer decided to paint the black rubber gasket, but now that paint is flaking off into the steel mesh filter (which is at least catching some of the larger ones). Unfortunately I've not been able to remove the filter, and so I had to pour through another filter to get those the red paint flakes out of the can.\n\nI like the design and it's still usable, which is why I'm giving it two stars, but needing to poor everything through a filter is a pain, especially for a brand new can that I paid nearly $40 for! I'm going to try to contact the seller to see if they will replace this unit. Hopefully it's just paint over-spray (defective) and they replace it.

The hole cutting thing is basically a metal tube with a moderately sharpened end.

The problem is the sharpened hole cutting tool is not very sharp and seems to dull after maybe 30 grommets.  The result is an incomplete cut which you then need to finish with a pair of scissors, and its hard to get a clean cut that way.  And pounding away at this tool to try to get a decent hole destroys the wooden block underneath leaving splinter refuse underneath, further eroding the ability to get a clean cut.\n\nThe instructions say its not meant for \"industrial use\" or whatever, clearly indicating you're not supposed to use it a lot as it will lose effectiveness.  You can sharpen the cutting tool and get a new block of wood at Lowe's but I was hoping for a self contained kit that would go the distance.", "label": 2}

Fit for all current eletric toothbrushes,\" but with grammatical mistakes like the ones you see in spam:\n\n\"4 STCK Zahnbrstenaufstze.\nPassed fr alle gngigen Elektrozahbrsten\"\n\nGrammatical errors:\n1) Why is \"stck\" all caps?\n2) The first sentence ends in a period, the second does not.\n\nAt the bottom of the package it says in poor English: \"Replacement brushes to be used with Electro toothbrushes that fits.\" No way an international company like Braun would write like that.\n\nOn the back of the package is a sticker with a bar code that reveals that these brush heads are not made by Braun. It reads: \"Braun Oral-B Compatible Ge...ent Power Toothbrush Heads New\".\n\nThe real Braun brushes have an inner ring of bristles different from the outer bristles; on these knock-offs, all the bristles are the same.\n\nSo it's up to you, but my feeling is: if I've already shelled out extra money for a toothbrush that is supposed to clean better than a hand-held one, why pay to make it no better by putting plain old tooth brush heads on it?", "label": 0}

{"text": "Be careful when you buy an item like this. It's important to buy the model that is designed for compact fluorescent bulbs. This particular model is designed for incandescent bulbs. As the sun hits the light sensor, it begins to flicker and  to dim and eventually turns off by mid-day. The sensor is essentially behaving like a dimmer. Sometimes light from the bulb itself will reflect into the light sensor and result in dimming of the bulb.\n\nChoose a different brand or model that is designed to be used with compact fluorescent lightbulbs. Because electricity through the sensor flows in an all or nothing fashion, the bulb will not appear to be dimmed. Like all of these automatic dawn to dusk controllers, any light that reflects into the sensor can still affect the function of the device; in my case it was causing intermittent blinking or random on/off behavior.\n\nMany factors affect the function of these devices. Sometimes it's the shape and color of the light fixture. Sometimes it's the length of the light bulb or intensity of the bulb. I also don't like the appearance of the lightbulb after it is lengthened by this device. My solution was to buy a different model/brand (from a big box store) designed for compact fluorescent bulbs. I wrote a review of a similar product and I find it works when I use short LED bulbs. Your mileage will vary.", "label": 0}

I received the Electrolux Home Care 1934B (yes, what you get is the newer model B, not A) vacuum just yesterday. I had it easily assembled in 10 minutes. This vacuum is as simple as it gets and it does its job very well, which is cleaning. It is relatively quiet compared to my previous bagless vacuum. The top of the vacuum has a knobble to adjust the hight of the rotating brush. I use setting 4 on my carpet, which guarantees very easy movement over the carpet while doing a good job on the \"brushing\" side. The cleaning results are great and consistent throughout the cleaned area. It also does a good job on reaching the corners and picking up dirt where my previous vacuum failed.\n\nFor cleaning the stairs, I strongly recommend purchasing the extension set here at Amazon.

Second, don't mistake this for Crazy Glue. You can't just press two surfaces together and imagine it's bonded.

It's also a little too noisy.\n\nIf you really want to get this one instead of the oral b, would suggest giving the soft bristles version a whirl instead - the softer bristles might be a little less abrasive on the enamel than this is.\n\nBut the price and the fact that it does do its basic job - cleaning teeth - keeps me from giving it a 1.", "label": 0}

The instruction packet informs you that it may cause tooth and gum sensitivity that should disappear after 2 days. Hmm...okay, noted.\n\nI started the 4- 20 minute sessions. During the 2nd session, I started to feel some discomfort, but nothing I couldn't manage. The 3rd and 4th sessions had increased discomfort, but I stuck throuh the 20 minute session for each.  I followed the directions exactly, with 10 minute- 20 minute breaks, and rinsing my mouth in between treatments. Afterward, my mouth was a bit sore- but the real pain was a few hours later.\n\nStarting 2 hours or so after I completed the treatments, I felt an intense tenderness in my gums and whenever I moved my mouth (to eat, drink, smile, etc.). What I found in the mirror were streaks of my gums that appeared to have been burned off. I looked on the inside of my lips, and the same thing- streaks of skin that looked burned by acid. I am not a doctor, but the above description is the best I can explain what I saw and how my mouth felt. As I write this review it is 34 hours after I did the treatments, and I am peeling pieces of my (burnt) gums and skin from my mouth. Needless to say I threw away my husband's kit.  I am much more tolerant of pain than he is, and had he done this treatment with me, I can't imagine what he would be going through. I have been on a liquid diet since, because it is too painful to chew food around my burning, tender gums and mouth.\n\nI do not have sensitive teeth, or gums.

{"text": "The PowerTwist Plus V-belt is often advertised as quieter, smoother running and with a far longer lifespan. Lifespan I can't measure but here's what I experienced with the first two qualities:  As an audio buff I used my sound level meter to measure dB sound reduction on my 6-month old Dewalt 746 tablesaw, Forrest II sawblade, before and after PowerTwist belt installation.  At the level of the operator's head the \"before and after\" decibel level was 81 and 81... no difference.  Two feet behind the saw at the level of the belt (below the table surface) the dB rating decreased from 93 to 92, a neglible amount.  Vibration was reduced - sensed by finger touch to the tabletop, and by using an old (and outdated) method of balancing car tires: viewing a glass of water placed on the tabletop surface, i.e., the size of the water-surface rings generated by the vibration.  Though the original vibration level wasn't a significant issue with this saw... it was reduced by, I'd guesstimate, 50%.  Possibly on old machines (using old belts) the vibration improvement would be greater. Excessive vibration possibly could cause sound harmonics... generating additional sound.  In an industrial situation with machinery running non-stop, the PowerTwist belt's extra cost, versus life span, is undoubtedly justified. In other instances, simply replacing an old belt with a new one would probably prove a better dollar value.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I bought this fuel can because I wanted a quality metal can that would contain vapors in storage, and hoped it would be easier to deal with than other CARB compliant cans.  While it may be easier to pour from (haven't tried that yet), it has a couple of significant drawbacks for me, as a small person with not a lot of hand strength.\n\n1.  The cap for the can is held down by a very strong spring, and to open the cap you have to hold onto the handle and pull back on a separate lever - much the same way as holding the safety bar to the handle of a lawnmower.  I found that I couldn't hold the can open with one hand and fuel with the other.  My solution was to use a tie wrap to fasten the lever to the handle to hold the cap open while fueling, and then cut it off when done.\n\n2.  The flash suppressor is a mesh screen inside of the opening.  My usual way of dealing with full five gallon gas cans is to siphon half the contents into a 2-1/2 gallon can and use the smaller can to pour into whatever I'm fueling.  However, with the screen it's not possible to siphon from this can; I couldn't see a way to remove it for siphoning without destroying it.\n\nI wish someone would sue CARB under the Americans with Disabilities Act for requiring these ridiculous mechanisms to prevent vapor loss. They are difficult for someone without a lot of strength to use, and would be impossible for someone with a disability.  The various measures that people have developed to work around the CARB requirements have probably released more vapors into the air than the old cans ever did.", "label": 2}
{"text": "For years I have used PC7 as my best all time glue, when I need stuff to really hold a permanent bond.  I heard people raving about this gorilla glue, so I figured I'd give it a try.

I wouldn't even have to clamp it, and the bond would be absolutely permanent.\n\nWith the Gorilla glue, since it foams and expands, I knew I had better clamp them, so I did.  I allowed the glue to cure for a full 48 hours, unclamped them and gave them a real hard test...  I pulled them apart with my hands!  Not very strong, at least in this situation.

{"text": "I'm surprised there aren't more complaints from users on how the brushhead's design traps toothpaste and mouth gunk (yuck!) inside its plastic shell- which can't be totally taken apart enough to get at the inner workings. Everyone is oohing and ahhing over the toothbrush's great performance (I don't disagree at all) but seem to overlook the poor design of the brushhead that allows gunk to build up quickly - even with a reasonably thorough \"cleaning\" following Sonicare's recommendations. They say nothing in the cleaning instructions on how to get into the areas beyond reach in the design.\n\nI was hoping the Elite series  would have improved on the older Advance series design that was hard to keep clean but not so. I don't know about most people but I wouldn't put something near my mouth festering with bacteria and black mold. I rinse the brushhead, wipe it as dry as I can and remove it from the handle  after each use to air dry- but it isn't watertight so despite best efforts stuff will get into the inner part of the brush/magnet unit that is factory sealed (I'm not talking about the removable threaded part that screws into the handle). I have ended up taking apart the factory sealed part by bending the plastic tabs and giving the inner parts a good hot water bath and scrubbing with a q-tip. But the unit obviously isn't designed for the user to easily do this.  Maybe Sonicare figures their customers will be discarding the brushhead in 3-6 months or whatever they recommend so no big deal.\n\nFor what you pay for the unit this is a major design flaw IMO. They need to design a totally sealed brushhead- why can't they use o-rings, rubber gaskets or a tighter rubber/vinyl boot like they use now to keep the brushhead sealed but still leave it flexible to vibrate?\n\nOh I laughed at the one negative review of the travel case- I use that a lot and the reviewer is super-picky. It's sturdy and latches fine and the plastic in the hinges is made to bend a lot. The carry case will outlast the toothbrush if they only last a few years like many people are saying.

Amazon shipping would not ship any other fuel container to CA, so I saw the great reviews and bought this one.  There is another traditional 5 gal fuel jug that says it's CARB approved, but they will not ship it to CA either!.\n\nFirst, the lid mechanism is spring loaded to the closed position by two very large springs.  It takes quite a bit of hand strength to open the lid.  There is no way my wife or grandson could open it.  They wouldn't even be able to put gas into the container with these stout springs.\n\nSecond, the yellow funnel arrangement seems nice on first glance, until you try to use it!  It mounts to the spout on a 90 degree angle so you cannot get the gas can tilted enough to get all the gas out.  My cars fuel filler spout (and most others) goes into the car at a 45 degree angle.  If I tilt the gas can all the way (sideways/90 degrees) the funnel interferes and wants to pop out of the 45 degree fuel neck (the funnel then wants to point straight down).  I could only get maybe 3 of 5 gallons out.  I tried to turn it sideways but it will only go so far.  I finally was able to get 4 out of 5 gallons out while spilling it all over my shoes, the side of the car, and the ground.\n\nThere needs to be a way to swivel the spout for different filler neck angles.  They also need to reduce the spring pressure on the spout and maybe add a safety lock to hold it down instead of that 50# of spring.\n\nNow the good:  Its made pretty well and the steel is not as thin as I thought by reading some of the other posts.

They are what I would call a good heavy unit in the low capacity type of wheel assemblies.  You can always buy better than this, but you will pay at least double or more to what these will cost you.  Good deal for the money and reasonably well made too!\nUPDATE: What I said above has been tested now.\nPart 1:  I built a 200# 4ft. X 8ft. plywood work table and installed 6 of these assemblies to make it light and easy to roll.  Loaded it is about 250 to 300# max.  The wheels can't handle it well at all.  The problem is not the wheel itself, it is the chincy metal materials they used.  Soft, flexible, and bends rather than turn on the rollers, even on a flat new cement floor.  Sad. Data: 300# by 6 rollers = ~ 50 # each loading.... pretty over rated huh?!\nPart 2:  I made a small cabinet for the Sander I bought on Amazon, and I used 4 rollers to easy the locating of the tool in my shop.  Wieghs about 100# with the sander: works perfectly.  DATA: 100# by 4 wheels = 25# per wheel.  Obviously, typical China Junk.... very overrated.  Listed to handle 220# loads each, and at 50# each they begin to fail.\n\nDerate them by about 400% and you are just about right.  If you must have 50# or more on them, the metal is just tooooo soft and bendable.  Otherwise, just great.", "label": 2}

{"text": "SEE REVISED REVIEW BELOW INITIAL REVIEW\nIneffective and glue hardens in bottle despite following instructions.\n\nThere are two very basic problems with this product, at least with my several different uses (i.e., different materials, wood, plastic, cloth, metal, etc.):  (1) It just does not hold up.  That is, it does not last long and is not very strong.  (BTW I follow the instructions *exactly*.)  (2) It very easily dries up in the bottle, even if you follow their instructions to try to get all the air out of it (which, by the way, seems impossible.)  I suppose this product *might* be useful if you were going to use it all up within a couple of weeks, but beyond that, it just does not do as advertised.\n\nI hate writing a negative review, especially when obviously there are others who have had a much better experience.  Frankly, I cannot explain the difference in experience.\n\nI would not buy this again, and wish I could return it and get a refund, but I'm past Amazon.com's cut-off.  Alas.\n\nI also do not have an alternative to recommend, but another to stay away from is Sticky Ass Glue SAG4OZ Waterproof.  Same problems, similar product to Gorilla Glue.\n\nIf anyone out there can recommend something that REALLY works, I'd love to hear it.\n\nREVISION, 1/17/2017:  Changed from 1 star to 3 stars (for customer service).  After getting the response from the Gorilla Glue company, I followed their suggestion and called their 800 number.  The woman I spoke to was very pleasant and very helpful, and said she would send me some more Gorilla Glue, this time in smaller containers than the 4 oz. bottle which, if you don't use it often, is more likely to dry out.  [RECOMMENDATION:  Buy the smaller bottle(s) unless you plan to use the whole bottle in about a year.]  ALSO NOTE:  They don't state on the bottle that the shelf life of GG is only 2 years, there is no expiration date on the bottle, and the date of manufacture is cryptic; see attached screen shot indicating \"13\", meaning a 2013 manufacture date, a black-font number printed vertically to the left of the gorilla on the front indicates the date of manufacture).  Had the bottle stated something like \"This product is expected to last no more than two years.\", along with an expiration date, I would have just lived with the problems I experienced.  The customer service rep told me that she would pass my suggestions on to management; let's hope they listen.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Nothing 'GITS 'ER DONE like Gorilla Glue! I was out on my daily hike here on the mountain last week and, down the valley at a lonely country crossroads, somebody had left a massive Tuscan-made, Della Robbia terra cotta sculpture just leaning against a tree. No kidding! The top portion of the piece had been broken-off entirely, and the much larger bottom portion was fully intact. Best of all, whomever left the pieces down at the junction had also left a plastic baggie filled with all (or most of) the chips that had broken off the sculpture. Clearly they didn't have the heart to throw this magnificent thing away, and I'm not surprised: the subject matter was probably meaningful to them (Nativity Scene) and Della Robbia sculptures of this size and quality can sell for well over $1,000.00 even after being repaired. Long story short: I hauled that 100-lb piece back up the 450-ft. hill for two hours, and then drove back down for the second piece. When I got it all home, I looked everything over in my garage workshop and said, \"THIS is a job for Gorilla Glue!\" and good old GG didn't let me down. After a few days of careful repair, I got it back in shape and will be able to retouch the few missing chips with ceramic paint easily enough. Easy to use as always, Gorilla Glue saved the day when it came to a truly unexpected and breathtaking \"roadside discovery.\" AWESOME.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The fryer itself seems to work quite well.  I have used it twice with crinkle cut french fries and twice to make Korean fried chicken (wings).  It heats up the oil relatively fast and gets it hot (I measured with a thermometer at 380 deg F when set to about 190+C) and when the temperature dips when food is placed in it, it gets back to temperature fast.  However, the bar to hold the basket is a tad too high so you have to really fill it up 2/3 or 3/4 full with oil instead of the 1/2+ mentioned in the manual if you want to hang the basket off the fryer and let it cook.  Otherwise you can put the basked all the way in so it sits on top of the element, which works pretty good.  (And is what I did).  However, the handle does not stay on the basket (slips off and yes, I have it in correctly).  It does not lock in tight enough and then the bottom fingers work their way out on one side.  I can live with that inconvenience.  However, the biggest issue is that the basket is NOT made of stainless steel, as indicated in the description.  After using it the first time, I washed off the little pieces of cooked on starch from my Korean fried chicken and left it to air dry (in a dry climate so it dried quickly).  After I went to put it away I noticed the ends of the wire that makes up the wire basket had rust on them, as well as some of the \"weld\" junctures where the wire crosses to make the basket (don't know if there is an actual weld there or just wire crossing).  Second time I used it, I had a lot of cooked on starch from the chicken and had to soak for a while in hot soapy water to loosen it up, and there was a lot more surface rust on the basket when I pulled it out of the sink to scrub off the water loosened starch.  I touched it to my shirt by accident and there is now a big cross-hatch brown rust stain on my shirt.  The fryer works quite well but the basket rusting right off the bat ruined it.", "label": 2}

{"text": "First let me say that this is the best electric fryer I've owned, and I've owned a few. But not everything is perfect. The good points: The temperature gage is accurate. This baby will reach 375deg's for fry's. Large basket, deep removable fry tank with bottom plate that sits above the heating rods which the basket sits on when lowered. Nice long solid electric cord that's attached to the back of the unit. Not magnetic connections. Two different hanging heights for the basket. This fryer will take up the width of the counter. Every item is removable for cleaning.\nNow the not so good point. Very thin sheet metal with sharp edges. No cut out for basket handle in cover. Would be nice to cover when frying. No side handles to move or position this fryer if filled and hot with oil. Sides and bottom are to hot to grab on too reposition. No side indentions in body top edge to remove oil tank. When tank is filled and you want to drain and replace with fresh oil, it is very hard to lift any side or end up from base to remove tank. Finger indentions in body top edge would help immensely. Basket handle hard to snap onto the basket. Plus the picture on instructions shows the handle going inside the basket bracket. It needs to snap around the outside of the basket bracket. I used up about 15 minutes trying to make it work going through the inside. Saw a correct picture of the basket on another web site. Now the blue thin removable plastic coating on the parts. This comes from the mill to protect the metal sheets from scratches. This is not put on by the fryer manufacture. I read some reviews complaining about this Saran Wrap covering. It's not that difficult to remove. I would have given this fryer 5 stars if not for what I stated.", "label": 1}

I think I just got the size wrong because the nail ended up going through the fence board and 2x4, but we already had the crew there and didn't have time to buy new nails so we just used them... =.= The 3 stars doesn't reflect my mistake in getting the wrong size nail. I just wanted to inform people that they should get 2\" nails rather than 2-3/8\". 2\" will work better for a fence board and 2x4. We measured 3\" with board and 2x4, but the force of the gun (even when at the lowest setting on the pressure possible to force the nail through) will jam the nail about 1/4\" deep into the board itself which somehow makes the nail poke out. Anyway, the reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because after it rained, the nails started \"leaking\" some black streaks on our yellow cedar fence!

{"text": "In my opinion this vise is only OK. The one I received had dings in the ways that had to be stoned smooth. The screws that hold the cranks on would not bottom so they were floppy. The stop collars are laughingly marked in .1mm increments but the screw nuts are so oversized that the slides will 'unwind' while in use. Especially bad was the Y slide - it had 1/8 turn slop in it with the stop collar adjusted as tight as it could get. This was helped somewhat buy putting a nylon washer between he collar and the nut.  The gibs don't take long to get out of adjustment. The whole base unit is light duty and without re-work is herky-jerky in movement.\n  The best part is the vise. It's slop is controllable, the .625\" Acme screw provides plenty of clamping power. Why they couldn't have made the slide screws with as close tolerance is anybody's guess. Would have added a star or two to the rating. Otherwise it's only slightly more useful than a plain old drill vise. Do not buy this thinking you can do any sort of precision work.", "label": 2}

The second time, I noticed that my gums were very sensitive. I made it to about fifteen minutes. The third time, I got to about ten minutes, and I was in a great deal of pain. My gums were sore, sensitive, and the parts near my gum line were white. The last time I only made it to ten minutes, and I was in a lot of pain. My teeth hurt very badly. I put some ice in my mouth after I had rinsed the gel out, and that helped.\n\nThe gel did work. My teeth were never horribly yellow, but I had some stains from increasing my coffee intake. This whitener works. My teeth were noticeably whiter after the use. I am sure that if I had been able to stand the pain for the whole cycles, my teeth would have been very white.\n\nOverall, this product does work, but man, beauty sure does hurt.

Wiping it off sort of helps, until you apply stain/varnish a week later and the stain appears a radically different color wherever you let the glue/foam touch the wood.\n\n3) It's not as strong as alphatic resin (wood glue).  Some will argue with this statement, but glue together four pieces of wood, two with alphatic resin, two with this stuff.  Now smash them both.  This stuff fails on the glue joint, whereas the alphatic resin will take a signifficant portion of the wood with it.\n\n4) It's three times as expensive as wood glue.\n\n5) It takes longer to use, since you have to moisten (with water) the two workpieces to be joined.\n\n6) It requires a longer clamp time than wood glue.\n\nSome will say that with practice these concerns can all be mitigated, but I've got enough trouble just training employees not to cut their fingers off in the table saw - Now I've got to \"train\" someone how to use glue?

{"text": "The tape I got sticks to the dispenser too well and if I can get the tape on the package it will stick there too.  The difficulty is getting it on the package.  I've used packaging tape for years in a standard big handheld dispenser and never had so much trouble applying the tape as I have with this type.  I find it very hard to get it to stick to the package when I first put it down there in order to pull the dispenser back and thus dispense the tape.  It seems the tape gets too strongly attached to the dispenser part to release.  If I can use two hands to get it going, it usually then releases with a whirl and I get a mile of tape which then tends to wrinkle at the cutting blade and won't cut.  It's so wrinkled and stuck to itself by then, it isn't suitable for the package. The frustration finally got to me so I bought the Duck brand tape which works much better for me.\n\nI had several rolls of this stuff left though so I purchased that very heavy desktop dispenser that also holds standard tape and a few pens.  Voila, this tape does really well in that dispenser.  I can pull it out easily and cut just the amount I need.  Of course that isn't going to work for large boxes, but to cover a mailing label for extra protection or add extra security to a post office mailing envelope or for a small box, it works fine.  The heavy duty quality of this tape seems overkill for those purposes, but I'm just happy I've found a use for it.  For my big handheld dispenser I far prefer the Duck brand.", "label": 2}

{"text": "We owned the original Sonicare for years and we loved it.  When we bought this model, we expected the same good performance we had from the original.  We were sorely disappointed by the fact that the screw on brush heads were flimsy and didn't screw down on the base unit securely.  We found the transfer of the ultra-sonic vibrations were dampened by the fact that the brush heads didn't remain tightly connected to the base unit.  After using this model for a year, we were receiving negative feedback from our dental hygienist.  We ended up buying another brand of electronic toothbrush but still weren't getting the results we expected.  Finally bought the Sonicare Flexcare model with snap on style heads.  This model works beautifully.  I would recommend you NOT buy Sonicare products with screw on style brush heads as they continuously loosen themselves from the base unit which degrades their performance.  The snap on style heads available on some Sonicare models remain securely attached to the base unit and therefore, transfer the ultrasonic vibrations to the brush head and your teeth more effectively.", "label": 0}

The effort will be a lot worse than using my snow plow. Definitley worse than using my 30 year old can with the screw on cap. Probably increased the possibility of spilling gas. Definitely do not recommend for older people or women that do not go to the gym on a regular basis.", "label": 0}

{"text": "UPDATE, 2016/07/28. I have to say that we have used this cleaner now four times, and a part broke, a plastic part.  And its not any part, but one you really, really have to have, the right hand lock for the discharge tank.  Two weeks ago I contacted Hoover and was told they would ship the part right out.  Two weeks later, the part box appeared, with the wrong side locking handle.  And because of the design, the two handles are NOT interchangable.  And, becuase the part is out of stock, Hoover cannot back order it, I have to keep checking back every two weeks.  As a result of this hassle, I have dropped my rating of this carpet cleaner from a three, to a one.  Count me not happy.\n\nThe star rating that I have given this item should tell you that I neither loved or hated this Hoover carpet cleaner.  But I was expecting something a little more substantial.  Does it clean carpets?  Yes.  Does it do what it says it will do? Yes.  It's built to commercial standards? No.\n\nRight out of the box, this item had me questioning if it was really meant for commercial use, or if \"commercial\" was a euphemism for \"basic\".  The unit is made of plastic - very inexpensive plastic.  The solution tank and the wastewater tank are light, but again, they don't feel substantial.  Neither does the handle.  Cheap.\n\nAssembly was easy UNTIL it came to the point where you are support to *snap* the cord into a channel clip on the body.  That was ten minutes of frustration right there because neither the channel clips or the cord will yield to the other.  In fact the plastic body part gouged the cord.  We were finally able to get the cord in the channel but it shouldn't have taken as much effort as it did.\n\nThe washer fluid tank comes with a built in measurer, its built into the cap, which is handy.  I never got a secure feeling that the tank was in the right place when installed into the machine - there's little feed back from the parts as they connect.  Foot pedals control the power and the handle drop.\n\nAs for cleaning, it does lay down solution, and it does suck it back up into the retention bin.  And yes, what it gets out is gross.\n\nAnd while it says its a \"steam cleaner\" there are no controls for a heater unit, there is no indicator light to show that anything is up to temperature.  And in use, there is no steam to be had, leading me to think that they used a part with the word \"steam\" on it.\n\nIMPORTANT: read the directions!!!  Do small areas as directed.  I have seen too many people make messes with carpet cleaners thinking that they are just vacuums that squirt clean and suck it back up.  And you have to wait until its completely dry, vacuum it well, and your results are not bad.  But if try to rush it, you will have uneven results.\n\nWill it holds up over time?  I have no idea until \"time\" passes.  (See the update, above)\n\nSo my bottom line is that this is a basic cleaner marketed as a commercial unit.  It is no fills.  No steam.  No water heating unit.  No upholstery tools.  And if appliances can be \"sexy\", as in amazing design, this is defiantly unsexy in its looks and features.", "label": 0}

I'll admit I was pretty skeptical when I saw more negative than positive reviews, but it was on sale so I went for it.\nThe instructions were pretty easy to follow and I started the first 20 min. application.\nAlmost right away I could tell I was a little sensitive, but it was NOTHING like other reviews said- completely tolerable, hardly enough to call uncomfortable. I took ibuprofen right before just in case, though. By the time the first 20 minutes were up, I noticed that it did sting a bit when the gel got on my upper gums too much, and my back molars are EXTREMELY sensitive as is so it didn't feel great if any got on them. But anyway, as I was saying, when I rinsed after the first 20 minutes I didn't see any difference, and was admittedly a bit dismayed. But persevere I would, kept going.\nAfter rinsing for the last time 2 hours later, my mouth was definitely hurting a little bit in the areas the gel touched, but it wasn't terrible. I noticed my teeth were SLIGHTLY whiter, but it was barely noticeable. So I guess it all depends on each individual's pain tolerance and works differently for everyone.

{"text": "I purchased this product by recommendation of a trusted hardware store owner to bond a loose plastic rain guard over the window of my GMC Sierra Z71 to the metal door frame.  For six months I have tested the glue on various applications including wood, plastic steel, and aluminum in both land and marine environments.\nThis is a non-tacky liquid that requires only two things to make it work well using common sense methods to apply.  Clamp/form where necessary and use water as a catylyst and bonding agent per instructions.  I prefer giving the surfaces a light, fine spray of water with a good spray bottle.\nA little goes a very long way.  This is the most fascinating material since \"aerogel\".  A little Gorilla will grow overnight, expanding, say, 399-400% at full cure into a final hard mass of structural air cells.  Excess can be shaved or cut off and sanded, if required.\nOther that the superb holding characteristics, the great wonder of this fluid polyurethane is its expansion capability to allow it to be used, also, as a filler/bonding material.  I have a 12 ft. wide overhead garage door on my boathouse by-the-sea.  On one horizontal section, where the glazing is stiled and railed, the wood around many of the hinge hardware has rotted.  After removing the dust and fragments of the dead wood fibers, substantial areas of irregular shape remained void of any material.  This poor condition makes it difficult to install new hardware and to find a surface to paint.\nThe solution is to clean and prep the area, spray the elements with water, with a glue brush the obscured interior areas and perimeter walls with some Gorilla.  Next, cut a section of clear heavy platic sheeting, say, from a packaging bag from some item you recently bought, or a Zip-loc, of size with sufficient overlap.  Then, solidly reinforce the damaged ares with a rigid, nailable sheeting to create a form, say, Luan underlayment, or equal, and tack this form to the tackable areas of the good wood.  Create a fill/vent hole at the highest point on one side of the voided-to-fill area.  Using the squeezable Gorilla bottle force the glue through the hole to fill, say, 1/3 of the voided volume. Sorry, but the exact amount is not known since the coefficent of expansion remains an unknown to this date, and may vary according to other elements of physics and science.  But, this is pretty much a dummy-proof method.  Let the project sit overnight.  If you don't see an excess of Gorilla that has forced its way out the vent hole, then give another light spray shot of water through the hole and inject some more Gorilla through the hole, sit and let cure.  Upon completion, cut access off, strip the form, sand, drill, if needed, and paint to finish. The extent of the area and conditions that this method of application can be used is unknown.  Also, the expected shelf-life is unknown, so I bought the 8 oz. bottle. The integrity of the glue is still good after six months.  Explore, test and share your results with others.  This is a worthwhile product that works as I never expected.\nIf you have a lot of broken stuff, never leave home without your Gorilla!", "label": 1}

I bought this hoping it would solve the problem. It works but is a little too thick for any doors or\nwindows I have come across. I ended up cutting off the top of it so it left the bottom with the sticky area and putting that next to the deal on the door and it works very well! The only other problem is that if it gets moved when the door opens and closed it can leave the sticky residue on the door. I can usually get it off pretty easily by using my nail so it's not a big deal but can get a bit tedious. Overall, this has helped and I would recommend it if you are having the same problem.", "label": 2}
{"text": "If you need a strong joint, but don't have the time or tools to make a completely tight fit, this glue works wonders.  I've used it to make strong joints between plywood edges and hardwood for a table top, for dowel  joints, and for screwed joints.  The glue expands by about three times and  will fill gaps up to about 1/32\" with close to full strength, and  larger gaps with less strength.  One caution, as it dries, the glue foams  up and you have to plan on chiselling off or power-sanding off the squeeze  out.  Also, you need to keep the joint under pressure for one to four hours  before removing clamps.  This is not a glue to use when  you need the joint  to set-up quickly, or when you will not be able to sand off the squeeze  out.  With that said, this glue makes strong joints with much less  preparation than conventional glues.  I use it whenever strength is  critical.", "label": 1}

{"text": "It takes a little practice to get used to these, and I kind of feel like it's a case of \"controlled chaos\" working with them. There's a lot of things that can go wrong, so they are potentially very dangerous. I didn't realize the first time I used them when you get to the very top of the lift, the weight of the jacks themselves will tend to push the wall over. I was trying to stop the wall from moving, and both of the jacks in  unison were fighting against me. I was very lucky that one edge of the top plate caught against an adjacent wall long enough for me to pull the jack out of place. I would have lost the wall otherwise.\n\nAfter that first little adventure I started to tie rope to the wall, but this is also a case of controlled chaos. If your ropes are too long, they can stretch, and the bottom of the wall can kick in and go over too. I find it best to get the walls within about 3 inches of plumb, brace the wall and get rid of the jacks. Then, and only then, push the wall into plumb.\n\nThese are very handy, but I would advise anyone using them to start with small walls (10') or so before approaching anything much heavier.  I can also say it takes about 45 min. to set everything up vs. about 15 min. with a helper. Of course if you have no helper, these are gold. Use nice straight 2x4's and be certain everything is well secured. Double up your 2x4's at the base or use the wind kit.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have been using this with my DeWalt sanders for years. Why pay a fortune for individual sheets from Lowes or Home Depot? This sandpaper lasts considerably longer, is much, much stronger and you simply cut it to size, stick one layer on the pad of your sander as a base, then add another layer,  clip them in and away you go. Not only that, it makes your pads last 10X longer as well. When it's worn out, remove it (I find it helps to let a few layers of sandpaper build up on the pad). This will save you a fortune in throw away single sheets and OK, it doesn't have any holes in it so you won't be collecting much dust - but then do you really anyway? Saves time, works better and saves a fortune in the long run. Does a much better job too and if you ever need a small piece for hand sanding, simply cut a sheet to the desired size, fold it over and stick it to itself and again, it won't slip, you won't be tearing it or cursing at it, you'll be able to get into those tight corners and the job will be done so much better in half the time!

{"text": "I bought this for woodworking, primarily for setting up my jointer and adjusting the jointer knife height.\n\nIt came in a thick plastic case, which is more than I expected. It could've been padded, but since I didn't expect a case at all I can't fault it too much.\n\nAssembly was easy and the instructions were very clear and not Engrish-y at all, unlike most stuff like this. The instructions were clear, to the point, printed on thick stock and included lots of pictures. Way better than what you usually get here.\n\nThe machining on the base is clean and pretty much flawless. Smooth surfaces are smooth as glass. *Very* heavy. Feels like quality, more than the cost would suggest.\n\nWhen placed on my cast iron jointer bed, the magnet holds solid as a freaking rock. Almost impossible to move.\n\nI tested the accuracy with feeler gauges (zeroed out on a table, then slid the gauge under the measurement rod). The measurement was so close to the value on the feeler gauge that it was probably due to human error while zeroing it out to the table's height and not error in the tool. Even so it was (by my eye) no more than 1/10,000 of an inch off, and more like 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 of an inch. Accuracy is not a problem here, I think.\n\nThere are lots of adjustments, included one I *love* and didn't expect. The middle of the horizontal rod has a micro adjustment screw. As you loosen and tighten it, the dial moves up and down by tiny amounts. It lets you insanely close to the surface of an object. The action is smooth and easy.\n\nSo, if the unit is so great why is it three stars. Well, three stars isn't a horrible score, but there's a severe quality control issue. The unit I got has one serious flaw. The dial came WAY off of 0. By default the gauge reads around -10 thousandths. It is impossible to adjust the measurement rod to zero it out on the zero mark, but you can adjust the actual measurement markings - so I brought the zero to the needle instead of vice versa. This isn't a perfect solution - you can't zero out the \"hundredths\" gauge (the one in the middle), and the whole face is tilted over since 0 is in the top left instead of at the top.\n\nIt seems like you could insert a washer between the top of the rod and the body of the gauge, and if you used the right size washer you could adjust the needle back to 0. It already includes one thin metal washer and a rubber o-ring. I don't have a tiny diameter, super thin washer to use for this, and I shouldn't have to. It really should have come calibrated to 0. I contacted Grizzly support to see if there's a secret way to adjust the needle but haven't gotten an answer yet.\n\nIf it turns out that the unit is easy to fix, or if they can make it right otherwise, then this is a 4 star unit, maybe more like 4 1/2 star. I'm not really sure yet if I want to go through the hassle of a return, since it does work really well otherwise.\n\nThere's also no way to \"tare\" the unit beyond the hundredths place. You can rotate the measurement scale so that zero is wherever you want, but that only works for a single rotation of the needle. You can't zero the center \"hundredths\" dial. This isn't a big deal since I got this to deal with thousandths of an inch, and zero'ing out is just a shortcut so you don't have to do subtraction. Still, it is something to think about.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I am building a garage.  This tool was fantastic.  I lifted a 24 ft fully sheathed 2x6 studded 10.5 foot tall wall using two of these jacks (buy two jacks for longer walls.  you won't be sorry).\n\nThis wall was framed on top of a 18\" stem wall, so in reality the wall was 12 foot high.  The limit for these jacks is a 10.5 foot wall.  There is chart in the directions that tell you the correct length of 2x4 for the size of the wall.  I had 16 foot 2x4 studs to attach the jacks to and it was not long enough.  The jack ran out of wood to ratchet up.  Luckily we had anchored the bottom of the wall and were able to straighten it to be upright using other means.  For the second wall I used 20 foot 2x4s and it was fine, but I would not recommend this because it exceeds the maximum for the jack.\n\nRemember the jack will not go backwards.  Once you start, you are committed to complete the task.  One smart thing we did was to do a miniature practice run with a make believe wall and a short stud.  This dry run prepared us for how the jack would function and react.\n\nEDIT UPDATE:  In addition to lifting the fully sheathed walls, we used the jacks to lift the 18 foot 6x12 garage header into place.

This worked great with JB Weld, but when attempted with GG the assembly immediately fell apart when the weight of the birdseed was added.

When I picked up the pieces of my project, I was able to pull the glue off the metal piece with my bare hands. \"incredibly strong\"? really?\n\nThe glue has the density of styrofoam when it cures.

It came in damaged but we were able to straighten it out. It was packed well but the box took a big hit on one corner during shipping. The label on the unit and the information on the product page state that the wattage is 2500 but as with our old unit we checked the current draw and it reads 13 amps. That comes out to about 1500 watts. It works well. takes about 10 to 15 minutes to heat to 350F. The old unit had a oil level mark but this one does not. We transferred the oil to the new one and marked it with a scratch on the pan. We measured the oil volume and it came out to 5 liters. I think that if you filled it with 6 liters it would boil over too easy. We use this in a outdoor kitchen so we don't worry too much about fire hazard but this unit has no UL or other safety testing and has no over temp safety controls so don't leave it unattended for very long. Large capacity lets you cook a batch of whatever you like without the oil heat loss you get with smaller units. Good crispy non greasy fish and fries are great.", "label": 1}

That's what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.\n\nThey manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)\n\n2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.\n\nThis method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.\n\nA bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don't have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it's topped off and you're good for a month's vacation.", "label": 0}

It also comes handy when I break open a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips.

That's maybe a week's worth.  It's also a watered down version of the tounge sprayer, another product by Breath Rx that costs 4x more than I would have expected and comes in a bottle nearly half the size as the breath sprayer.\n\nI wouldn't rate this product in terms of efficiency over 2 or 3 tic tacs, and at the same price, I could buy enough tic tacs to start my own mariachi band.

{"text": "I'm not thrilled with these.  When the poles are fully extended they are a bit wobbly until jacket tight against, in this case, top plate being uses as a fire block.  I doubt that these would be stable holding up the 150 lb limit when fully extended, because the 2nd section (from the bottom) can move horizontally so there not entirely straight.  They max out at a height of only 102 inches (perhaps a little more), without extending the last section which has a much smaller diameter.  The top/bottom feet don't look to be made of particularly durable material, given the weight of the poles.  Heavier feet would be useful (Larger ones are available).  I'm thinking of returning them and probably will if I can find something more to my liking, i.e., something similar that could allow greater pressure to be applied.

I'm realizing that I should've looked more closely before ordering.\n\nNumber one: I wish the fractions were on the inside edge and decimal on the outside.  If I'm looking at 1/64in on the outside, that is 0.0156in. The inside is incremented  at 0.01in.  The larger and easier one to read should be on the inside.\nNumber two: the decimal only reads to 0.01in.  Most dial calipers will read to 0.001in.  And in the description it is listed both ways...\nNumber three: I like the fractional measurement (I work with welders who use to fractional tape measures) and it serves as a fantastic cross reference (I bought it because it had the fractional measurement). But I wouldn't have minded the graduations going to 1/128in instead of just 1/64in.  In reality a good tape measure reads in 1/32in and you can estimate a 1/64in if you need to.  So the advantage of this over a tape measure is not huge.\n\nLong story short; its a very nice calipers and the price is good (especially for dial which is what I wanted), it's just not the precision I was hoping for.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I had high hopes for this product, I purchased this plus the mouth wash from Walmart (better prices there) and wanted to give it a few weeks before giving an honest review. I read the positive reviews and figured because it cost twice as much as other whitening toothpastes at half the bottle size it was bound to work. Now keep in mind, I drink coffee, but usually no more than one cup in the morning. I also follow the directions and brush and use the mouthwash first thing in the morning, about 30-45 minutes before drinking any coffee. I also mix milk in my coffee so it isn't black (not as strong staining power. I saw very little improvement after almost one full bottle of the paste. I was so disappointed I searched out another paste and found Crest 3D Glamorous White for about $3 less as well as it's a much bigger bottle. I had used the 3D line before, in fact I have it in my desk for after lunch brushing. Buy this! You can get it at almost all drug and grocery stores and I saw immediate improvements in no more than one day. Be sure to get the Glamorous white as it works much better than original.

What I really was getting was getting tape that was twice the normal thickness and half the length of the general purpose version of this product. Because the tape is so thick and strong it hard to deal with it in a tape dispenser on small packages (e.g., priority mail boxes is what I mostly ship) because it doesn't cut easily from the dispenser and I have a good commercial quality dispenser. If you need a strong tape, then this is the right packing tape for you and you would rate 5 stars.

{"text": "I had some damage to woodwork in my home done by a couple of Gorillas delivering furniture. They actually broke chunks out of my custom made woodworking.

The glue isn't clear and it looks yellow after it cures.\n\nMy suggestion is to use the right glue for the job. There are better wood glues out there that are easier to use and to clean up. I also like epoxy glues for many jobs as they are stronger and they dry harder. The gel versions can also be used to fill in gaps and it quickly hardens.\n\nThis glue seems to have a limited shelf life and you wind up throwing away a lot more than you will use.

{"text": "I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago? I don't remember. The technology clearly works. My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque. I have never used any of the other \"sonic\" toothbrushes. I imagine they work as well.\n\nMy original Sonicare just started acting up. It still works, but I think the battery is dying. So I bought the e7300. First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless \"features\" so they can engage in marketing hype and jack up the price. It looks to be more cheaply made. I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit. It looks to me like it was designed to fail.\n\nI was annoyed by the very first page of the manual. It tells me to make sure the handle is properly seated in the base, because if it is put in wrong, the charging light may still come on, but it won't charge. What kind of engineering is this? If it's not charging, don't turn the light on. Don't they have engineers smart enough to figure that out? So I tested it. Sure enough, you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on. This is just lazy or careless design work.\n\nWorse, the base is too small, too light, and too shallow. In the original unit, the handle goes well over an inch into the base and there is only one way it will fit. With this unit, the base only holds the handle by about a half inch so it's easy to put it in wrong. And sure enough, no matter how you put it in, even half falling out, the charging light lights up. Looks like it was designed by the marketing department?\n\nThen there's the idiotic 2-minute shutoff. I can see zero benefits and several disadvantages. First of all, why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes? Do they think I might leave it on or am too lazy to turn it off myself. This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.\n\nBut that's not the most annoying problem. You do NOT want to take the thing out of your mouth while it is running or you will spray toothpaste and spit everywhere. After a few uses, I am operating on autopilot. When I finish brushing, I click the on/off button to turn it off and remove it from my mouth in one simultaneous motion. If you happen to finish brushing just as the thing shuts off (after 2 minutes), clicking the on/off button will actually turn it back on as you are removing it from your mouth. Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror, the sink, your shirt, the wall, the floor... Nice. #@$%#$@!!! I have done this a few times. Not good.\n\nPersonally, I find the \"timer signal\" every 30 seconds annoying, too. I just want a simple on/off button. It's a toothbrush, not the control panel for a heart-lung machine. KISS. Actually, I have no problem with this \"feature\" if some people are unable to figure out how to brush without a built-in timer as long as the company provides a way to turn the infernal thing off. But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.\n\nIn the original model, I could at least turn off the 30-second reminders by holding the on/off button for a few seconds -- simple. With this \"improved\" model, they have added a \"dual speed\" button, but it only works while in the charger. Now that's convenient. I have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way. Now I have to move the charger to where I can actually see it. My guess is that they are again protecting me from myself so I won't accidentally change the settings while I am using the unit. Did they test this on morons? Did they test it at all?\n\nThe ultimate insult to injury is in the instructions on recycling the battery. I am told to first deplete the battery. I am to do this by removing the unit from the charger, turning it on, and letting it run until it stops. But it stops every 2 minutes! Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks (twice a day) on a full charge, they are really asking me to stand there for an hour (2x2x14 minutes) and restart the unit 28 times. Like that is going to happen.\n\nOn the bright side, it comes with a very nice travel case. I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit, which is probably why it broke and I bought this piece of junk.\n\nSummary: The technology works. This unit was designed to fail early so that you would buy a new one. I give it 3 stars for cleaning teeth and 0 stars for arrogant, cheap design and being overpriced.\n\n07/30/10 I have since junked this thing and bought an Oral B Sonic Complete. (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Oral-B-S-320-Sonic-Complete-Rechargeable-Power-Toothbrush/dp/B0002M50Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush</a>) What a difference. The Oral B is well designed (with one minor annoyance) and it cleans better. I have a mouth guard. I clean it every morning. It had become yellowed over the years.

{"text": "I am a professional contractor. We got these to transport 10' and 12' sheets of of 5/8ths rock. The downward pressure these things created was unbelievable. I ended up pulling/tearing ligaments in my right wrist and forearm. The standing position you must have while using these is very 'off' compared to the conventional way of transporting ply/rock. I tweeked all sorts of muscles in my left shoulder and hip areas. I feel like I may have re-pinched a nerve in my neck. I can't count how many tens of thousands of lbs of drywall I've carried throughout my career without having any problem. I can easily carry two sheets of 5/8ths plywood by myself. I'm definitely no light weight and am very experienced with handling sheet goods.\n\n I could see it working for DIY homeowners who are carrying single sheets of 8' goods. It may have some advantage when you need to carry ply or drywall through a low doorway, as the handle enables you to hold the sheets lower than the way you would normally carry. I still would not recommend using this item if you have to make 20-50 trips with it. I believe the traditional way is much safer when moving a large amount of wood/drywall. Please keep in mind; I made about 60 trips with these things. I'm sure they're alright for a few trips, but for professional use I don't recommend them.", "label": 0}

This sandpaper lasts considerably longer, is much, much stronger and you simply cut it to size, stick one layer on the pad of your sander as a base, then add another layer,  clip them in and away you go. Not only that, it makes your pads last 10X longer as well. When it's worn out, remove it (I find it helps to let a few layers of sandpaper build up on the pad). This will save you a fortune in throw away single sheets and OK, it doesn't have any holes in it so you won't be collecting much dust - but then do you really anyway? Saves time, works better and saves a fortune in the long run. Does a much better job too and if you ever need a small piece for hand sanding, simply cut a sheet to the desired size, fold it over and stick it to itself and again, it won't slip, you won't be tearing it or cursing at it, you'll be able to get into those tight corners and the job will be done so much better in half the time!

When it came time for a wedding I had to attend, and there was no time left to do a two-week program, I decided to try this product because a friend said it worked well for her.\nI was a little hesitant at first because my teeth are already a little sensitive to hot and cold, but I was desperate for something, so I tried it anyway.  By the end of the first 20 minutes, my teeth hurt a little.  By the start of the last 20 minutes it was almost too painful to keep them in, but I managed.  I didn't notice that much of a difference in color right away, but this morning - a day later - I can definitely tell it worked pretty well.  Like another reviewer said, my teeth aren't glowing white like some celebrities, but they are definitely better than they were before.\nAs for the pain, my teeth started hurting halfway through the process, but stubborn me, I kept going with it.  I had shooting pains all through my face all night (I used the product yesterday between 2:30-4:30pm).  I did not get any white spots or streaks on my teeth or gums.  However, my gums did blister, but not until later in the evening.  It took about 5-6 hours after I finished the process for the real pain to show up.\nThis morning, my teeth hurt much less than yesterday, but my lower gums hurt WAY more.  I think I have a huge blister on the inside of my lower lip, and a small one on the inside gumline behind the teeth where the tongue touches.  I feel like I got punched in the jaw, and I can't smile or drink or anything without severe pain.  In fact, it hurts even when I'm not making any facial expression at all.\nI don't know if I'll ever use the product again.  I might, but next time I definitely won't do all four sessions back to back.  I just wish I'd known about the pain first.  #I'm pretty sure I'm stubborn enough that if I had read the reviews here I'd have thought I wouldn't end up with these blisters like other people.)\nI gave it three stars because it worked, but I'm not sure it was worth the pain.\n\nUPDATE:  I wrote this review too soon.  The sensitivity in the teeth only took about 24 hours to go away, but I ended up with blisters and pain like I have never had in my life in the area where the lower lip meets the gums.  The full extent of the pain did not show up until about 24 hours after the treatment, when the blisters finally broke.  It took about a week for them to fully heal, and there's still some pain once in a while.

That being said, here's the rundown of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nHeats up fast.\nHolds a lot of oil.\nLarge basket for cooking.\nEasy to clean.\nSturdy design.\n\nCons:\nMetal edges are not de-burred (easy fix, see below).\nBasket handle is a pain to assemble.\n\nAnother reviewer said it takes a long time to heat up.  It actually takes about as long as other fryers, but it's heating a larger capacity oil tank, so it evens out.  It also heats up fast when new food is placed in the tank.\n\nThe metal edges are sharp, but not knife blade sharp.  It's really only a big issue on a metal plate that sits below the basket and protects the heating element.  I used a Dremel to remove the sharpness on it and the oil tank which took about 5 minutes (another reviewer used a nail file).\n\nOverall a great buy.  I should probably give it 4 stars because of the sharp edges, but it was an easy fix and I love the fryer so much I just can't see dinging it for that.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have owned my Elite model for about 6 months now.  Previous to that, I was the owner of the \"original\" Sonicare toothbrush for about 7 years, which used the standard heads rather than the angled \"elite\" brush heads.  I replaced it only because the non-user-replaceable battery finally gave up the ghost.\n\nIn general, all the sonicare models do an outstanding job of keeping teeth cleaned, if used properly.  I like the sonic action better than rotary or slower-speed mechanical motion.  The sonicare keeps my teeth feeling polished.  The timer also forces me to brush for a full 2 minutes - 30 seconds for each quadrant of my mouth.\n\nAs such, I am not going to spend a lot of time commenting on the effectiveness of the sonicare approach in general (which I think is excellent) or in comparing it to other brands.  Instead, I'm going to focus here strictly on comparing the new Elite model to the previous model which used so-called \"standard\" sonicare brush heads rather than \"elite\" brush heads.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the relatively few things I like about the new model:\n\n* battery indicator - shows when charging (which old one had) and shows how much charge remains (which old one did not have)\n\n* styling - mine is blue/white and looks attractive with its rubberized side grips.  However, I have a sneaking suspicion the rubber is going to fade and look old more quickly than my older model which was entirely white plastic except for a single small on/off button.\n\n* charger - the new charger has open sides, unlike the old model which was a sealed \"well\" that would trap water and give rise to gunk build up.  The new design seems like it will stay cleaner and inhibit model or mildew...at least on the charger base itself\n\n* angled brush head - the angle of the \"elite\" design makes it easier to clean behind your teeth and is used even in most non-electric toothbrushes today.\n\nUnfortuately, that is about it in terms of improvements.  The big black mark (and I do mean black literally) is that there is a significant problem with mold build-up on this design.\n\n* BLACK MOLD - On my old model, I never had a mold problem - ever.  Also, the mold problem is not a factor of my environment.  I live in Nevada.  Humidity is the least of our worries and my house runs conistently drier than normal, particularly in the winter when it is cold and there is very little moisture in the air and the forced-air furnace is running.  Many people have to use humidifiers (I don't use one) to keep the house comfortable.\n\nOn my old model, I never removed the brush heads except to change them and perhaps once a month to clean the built-up toothpaste that accumulated around the collar that secured the head to the handle.  I can honestly say that in 6+ years, there was never a hint of a mold problem.\n\nOn the new model, however, I began to see the appearance of black mold within 2-4 weeks of purchase.  I think it may actually have to do with a rubber seal that is now placed around the base of the brush stem.  Water can seep in and remain trapped more easily than on the old model which had no opening at that location.  A sanitizer won't help, either, because the location where the mold is growing is not likely to be exposed to the UV light in the charger.  It focuses on the brush stem and bristles, while the mold is in a sort of \"cavern\" that the light won't reach.  In my opinion, the new model is a poor design and the company is going to have a significant problem until they redesign the brush heads and eliminate this rubber seal entirely, reverting back to a completely encapsulated design.\n\n* Handle - my old handle was constructed entirely of plastic, with no rubberized sides.  Admittedly, the new sides make it easier to grip.  However, I don't ever recall dropping my old handle because it was overly slippery and my old handle sayed nice and clean because it was entirely of smooth plastic.  After 6+ years the white had discolored to an unattractive dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  Any white plastic is bound to discolor over time.\n\nThe new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  Not a big deal, but worth noting.\n\n* Handle seal - the handle's cover has a very small gap around the circumference, right below the threads where the brush head attaches.  This is an obvious location for moisture ingression, since when you stand the toothbrush upright, water will drip down to the little \"ledge\" formed in this location and pool there.  The gap isn't large, but is visible to the naked eye.  If I can see it, so can water molecules.  In time, I suspect this will spell a problem for the internals.\n\nAll in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  However, I'm afraid these modest improvements do not eclipse the serious problem noted above; namely, mold growth.\n\nI never used to have to take my brush head off, except when toothpaste built up and actually started to inhibit the sonic vibration of the brush head.  Now, I've taken to removing the brush head after every use to allow everything to air dry properly.  It's a bigger hassle and I'm not confident it will alleviate the mold growth.  After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.\n\nAnd, I'm not real keen about having black mold 3 inches from my mouth, even if it is trapped inside the \"guts\" of the brush head and not on the brushes/stem itself.", "label": 2}
{"text": "My old Eureka vacuum cleaner, which I loved, finally gave up after 14 years.  It was built like a tank, had great suction, and no plastic bells and whistles.  I replaced it with the new model.  It is still simple, no bells or whistles, and seems to work well, so far.  But it is made with much more plastic and is lighter than the old one.

{"text": "I purchased this because of the rave reviews for such an inexpensive vacuum. I received a 1934B Boss Upright instead of the 1934A that I had ordered here. After contacting the seller, I was told that the B model has replaced the A model and there are no differences between the two. According to the 1934A picture on this site, the 1934B is a different color (grey bag and dark grey base) with different logos. Based on my browse today, the seller I purchased this from is no longer selling this item so hopefully you won't have the same issue. Long and short of it - this review is for the 1934B.\n\nPros:\n1. It has great suction and is very lightweight.\n\nCons:\n1. The handle doesn't fit securely in the base and it tends to move ever so slightly while base is stationary.\nThe chord is short.\n2. I would pay an extra few bucks to have the upper hook that the chord wraps around for storage pivot for quick chord release.\n3. The horseshoe-shaped deal attached to the plug end of the chord that is supposed to allow you to secure the plug end of the chord to the rest of the stowed chord is too small. Instead of a tidy, tightly wrapped chord after I'm done vacuuming, I have a loose end hanging on the floor ready to be stomped on by my little ones.\n\nWould I purchase this product again? It's better than the 25 year-old Kenmore I was using before, but I think any vacuum would be. I find myself frustrated by the chord quirks every time I use it, so I'm going to say no, I wouldn't purchase it again.", "label": 2}
{"text": "I love how our previous bag-less vacuum claims it \"Never loses suction.\"  Ha!  Yeah right, unless you don't clean the filters every 3 weeks.  Most of you know how cleaning those little suckers is such a messy, nasty chore.  My wife and I both love this vacuum.  The 2 issues we have with it are: the short cord and the fact it sucks up kitchen rugs a little too easily.  But it cleans very well, is super lightweight and easy to maneuver.  The best part is kissing those filters goodbye forever.  Well that, and the price.\n\nEdit: A few years ago, I gave this 5 stars.  Now it's 3 stars.  The roller brush froze up once and now requires me to remove it and grease up the end caps to keep it spinning smoothly.  I have to do this every 3-6 months.  If I don't, it freezes up and the belt burns up.  That's a nasty smell.  I've never had a vacuum require me to lube the roller brush, so for this reason I'm knocking some stars off.  The vacuum still works well otherwise.  And we still use it frequently some 3 years after purchase.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I LOVE the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush. But I've had it for over 6 months and the handle/base is disgusting. There are [unnecessary?] crevices in the handle where the brush head attaches and it's a haven for bacteria and mold. Yep, mold is growing in the handle of my toothbrush. I've tried using rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab to clean it, but it's still disgusting because nothing will fit into those tiny crevices. I've read other people's complaints about this on the internet but I see no good cleaning methods suggested, and the Sonicare website makes it sound like it's a breeze to clean once a week: \"Wipe away any residue you find, including the area covered by the cuff, with a soft cloth or paper towel. To clean your handle, run a damp cloth around the recessed area once a week.\" If it were only that easy.\n\nOn the other hand, every time I brush this toothbrush makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist. And I just had my first dentist appointment since using the Sonicare and cleaning my teeth was a breeze for the hygenist...barely any plaque to scrape off at all. (The prior appointment was an excrutiating 45 minutes of scraping and sore gums for days after.)\n\nPlease note that if you're not used to using a powerful electric toothbrush, it will take you about 2 weeks to get fully used to this toothbrush. The first time will be a shock and you'll wonder how brushing your teeth with that toothbrush could ever be pleasurable. But try it for 2 weeks before making a final decision.\n\nI would have given this toothbrush 5 stars easily if it weren't for the cleaning issue.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Problem 1: There is a small plastic bracket that attaches the bottom foot to the steel pole.  This bracket was damaged during shipping on both poles.

It actually makes it difficult to adjust the length of the pole, especially when it is in the shortest position and there isn't a good handhold on one end.\n\nSolution:  I removed the nubs.  They were easy to pop out the bottom of the pole (due to the conveniently damaged bottom foot brackets).  There is a tension-screw that can also be used to lock the pole open and it works just fine.  If you were planning on putting a heavy load on the pole, it would probably be a good idea to put a small bolt through the nub holes, just to make sure the pole doesn't slide closed.\n\nOnce I got past these problems, the poles actually work really well.  They are long, sturdy and easy to adjust.  The pole body is steel, so my magnetic laser level will clip right to it.  The top foot has a pump mechanism that makes it easy to lock the pole into place between floor and ceiling.

{"text": "I've read the reviews on the Shark.  While it's not in the same class as the Vapor 2000, I think the Shark is getting a bit of a bad rap.  Oh sure, it's a toy when compared to the might of the 2000.  But the Shark is less expensive.  My sister has a Shark and it does okay on small jobs, like cleaning around sink faucets.  I don't believe the Shark was designed for heavier cleaning than that.  And I don't think it will hold up to every-day use.  So if durability and muscle are what you're looking for, go for the 2000.  But you'll have to spend more than 100 bucks.  I was willing to do that because I wanted power and a steamer that will last.  But for those who don't have extra cash sitting around, the Shark is worth a look.  Just don't be surprised if you have to send it back for repairs every now and then.  The Shark is a frail cleaning machine more suited to occasional cleaning than every-day cleaning.", "label": 0}

I mounted it on the wall in the garage and thought it would be great for quick cleanups of the car and floor. It does neither well. The small hose diameter and poor suction stop it from picking up any large items. (It will not pick up leaves off the garage floor).  To make maters worse the hose size is identical to the disposable clear plastic caps on top of water bottles. If you happen to vacuum one up, it gets stuck in the hose and takes quite a bit of time and effort to get out.  I rarely use it anymore.

The brake seems to work well too.\nSo far I have been satisfies enough to buy a second batch of them.  I bought them twice, and my current use under my work bench is doing well.  These are well worth the price.\nUPDATE: What I said above has been tested now.\nPart 1:  I built a 200# 4ft. X 8ft. plywood work table and installed 6 of these assemblies to make it light and easy to roll.  Loaded it is about 250 to 300# max.  The wheels can't handle it well at all.  The problem is not the wheel itself, it is the chincy metal materials they used.  Soft, flexible, and bends rather than turn on the rollers, even on a flat new cement floor.  Sad. Data: 300# by 6 rollers = ~ 50 # each loading.... pretty over rated huh?!\nPart 2:  I made a small cabinet for the Sander I bought on Amazon, and I used 4 rollers to ease the locating of the tool in my shop.  Weighs total about 100# with the sander: works perfectly.  DATA: 100# by 4 wheels = 25# per wheel.  Obviously, typical China Junk.... very overrated.  Listed to handle 220# loads each, and at 50# each they begin to fail.\n\nDerate them by about 400% and you are just about right.  If you must have 50# or more on them the metal is just tooooo soft & cheap.  Otherwise, just great.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I have owned and used steamers for several years.  I purchased this to replace my older Delonghi Steam Clean Plus and here and overall found the unit produced consistent steam but lacking in pressure somewhat compared to my older model.  I actually purchased the steam cleaner from a warehouse club and it had a very nice selection of accessories including an extension rod hanger that allows you to steam garments on a hanger extending from the top of the extension rod.  Basically the steamer is the same as this model 275 in terms of boiler, wattage, basic design.\n\nThe unit did warm up fairly quickly and I was impressed with the quality of the accessories, using thick plastic, good quality rubber seals etc.  This model I think would work well as doing primary duty as a clothes steamer but its lack of pressure make it not the best choice for blasting nooks and crannies, where a really good steamer excels as a cleaning maching no other device can touch.\n\nLet me explain.  I compared this steamer with the Saeco Piccolo steamer and with a high quality thermometer recorded the Saeco at about 190 degrees and the steamFast at about 170-180 degrees.  Secondly I put a paper cup on the floor and with both machines heated up with a full tank of water, I pointed the nozzle at the opening of the cup to see which model would blow the cup the farthest.  The SteamFast product blew the cup about five feet.  The Piccolo blew the cup 15 feet and probably would have kept going if it was not for the wall stopping it.  Not even remotely close.\n\nNext I took both steamers out on my deck and pointed the nozzles at a hose that \"overwintered\" on my deck....complete with black moldy stains hiding the normally greeen hose.  The SteamFast product blew steam at the hose but it did not really eliminate the moldy stains.\n\nNext tried the Piccolo...WOW....this sucker blasted those stains down to fresh green hose.\n\nTest over.  Note: I also tried the same test with a Euro-Pro Shark Steam Blaster Ultra with similar results to the Chinese made SteamFast product.\n\nI will add some more details in my review of the Saeco Piccolo. Needless to say, I returned the SteamMax.\n\nLet me say, I think the overall positive results for this product are not surprising to me considering most users have not probably used an Italian made steam cleaner which seem to have hotter steam vapor, far more pressure, a longer track record of using similar technology in espresso machine manufacturing, etc.  The downside of the Italian products is that it might be a bit harder to find parts and service for since they are not produced for the mass market like the steamFast and shark products.  It's too bad as I really wanted the SteamFast or Shark to perform better.\n\nHonestly if you don't make the comparison between the Piccolo or similar italian made steamer and the SteamFast, you may think you are getting a great product as it will produce consistent steam...but you won't be aware of HOW MUCH MORE YOU COULD DO with the serious pressure levels of the Italian steam cleaners.  I hope some other people do some comparisons.\n\nIt was kind of fun to be my own consumer reports for the last few weeks, but I am a huge fan of these cleaners and their many uses.  Most Americans have not caught on to what the Europeans have known for years.", "label": 2}

{"text": "All the reviews you may have read pointing out the sharp edges are exactly correct. Here's the deal: This thing is an excellent example of the stereotypical \"cheap Chinese carp\" that everyone complains about. The sheet metal used in the manufacture of this fryer is WAY too thin. And, it seems to have been made in a garage by someone using sub-standard sheet metal gear that needs to be tightened. Both of those things contribute to the sharp edges. Plan on doing a little filing or if you have a tool handy you can probably just burnish the edges. Also, due to the extreme thinness of the metal, the cover is very flimsy and gets very hot. And the knob by which one must lift it is quite small. It is clear to me that no American company would put their name on this item, and apparently neither would a Chinese company as there doesn't seem to be any sort of trade name on it anywhere. Or, maybe it's in Chinese and I just don't recognize it. Also pay attention to the remarks about NOT having a \"fill to\" line. I think I may have overfilled. Yes, the oil pan is also too flimsy for my taste. And yes, the fry basket is apparently NOT actually stainless steel and DOES seem to have a tendency to rust. Poor job of chrome plating or really poor steel?  Who knows? As for the temperature control and indicator, so it's in Celsius - so what? Get out your old oil/candy thermometer. It probably has both F and C scales so you can figure it out. Or, get a paint pen and make your own marks. All this being said, the machine DOES work. I have not yet been able to get a meter on it to see if it does use the wattage indicated, but I can't notice that it heats a whole lot faster than my previous one. This may be due to larger capacity/overfilling. Given the really cheap sheet metal work, I have serious reservations about the heating elements and controls - but after a few uses it still seems OK. I guess my advice is to be governed by the old adage, \"you get what you pay for.\" Didn't pay much, didn't get much, but it works.", "label": 2}

{"text": "We live in Northern Michigan and get a late and early killing frost every single year.. This year I put a hoop house up over the garden using PVC, Wood and this plastic.. The hoop house is 15' long, 16' wide and 8' tall.. It has a peaked roof line. This plastic fit perfectly. We had poly windows to use around the bottom of the hoophouse so we cut off part of the plastic to make the doors, but the point is, it was big enough for this size greenhouse/hoophouse. It seems sturdy enough.. We had another hoophouse with greenhouse plastic that lasted 4 years. It collapsed this past winter, so we removed the plastic. That plastic was actually still in pretty good shape.. We aren't sure if this plastic is going to last that long or not, (kind of doubt it) but since it cost 1/4 of what we paid for the greenhouse plastic, we decided it was worth the try. Will know by the end of the summer how well it holds up to the sun and hot temps, but for now, it's doing what we wanted it to do.. It's 100 degrees  with very moist air in the hoophouse today with the doors open.. The plants seem to love it.\n\nUPDATE: Product didn't make it through the winter.. It started ripping loose around the edges despite the fact that the snow slid right off it. One entire side is ripped loose and flapping in the wind.. It'll need to be replaced. Although it was very easy to work with and a great size, in the long run, greenhouse plastic is the better choice for hoop house/green house use.. But it was worth the try, although the price has increased by $10 since we bought it.. I wouldn't buy it again for the hoophouse..", "label": 2}

If you need to use it anyhow, the solution is simple. Put the hole punch in a drill.

There was no instructions included on the package on how to use the metal hangers so it took a few trys to get it right. The boards rested very well on the hanger and were stable when the Lap Panel was set vertical. The negative issue with the guage is the overlap was not 1-1/4 inch as specified.  The overlap was actually 1-3/4 inch which I did not discover until I had hung up 4 lap panels. This extra 1/2 inch overlap would cause me to not have enough lap panels to cover the height of the wall.  I had calculated the amount of 8 inch panels needed using 1-1/4 inch overlap. I added a 1/2 inch spacer to the guage and this corrected the overlap to the correct 1-1/4 inch.\n\nI hope other people have not had this problem when purchasing the Malco siding guage from Gradys Hardware Inc.

However, we've only cleaned our carpeted areas once right when we moved in which was years ago.  Therefore we've been in the market for a carpet cleaner we could use to clean up the carpet.  Enter the Hoover Commercial C3820 Spotter and Carpet Cleaner with 3 Brush Roll Speeds.  Here are my thoughts;\n\nPros\n\n+ Removable brushes make for easier cleaning.\n\n+ Thorough cleaning with multiple spinning brushes.\n\n+ Both tanks are removable and washable.\n\n+ Cleans up small and medium stains/spills quite quickly.\n\n+ Easy to use and assemble.\n\n+ Long power cord of 35'.\n\nCons\n\n- Quite heavy at around 30lbs.  Be careful of tip overs when doing stairs.\n\n- Plastic components feel cheaply made and I worry about the seals holding.\n\n- Large size make storage a problem for those with little room.\n\n- Pricey for what you're getting.\n\n- 1 year warranty only.\n\nThe Hoover Commercial C3820 Spotter and Carpet Cleaner with 3 Brush Roll Speeds is a very basic cleaner which does its job well enough.  It had no problems getting basic strains, dirt and grime out of our carpet.  However, I would really only recommend this vacuum for homes with more minimal amounts of carpet.  It says \"commercial\" use but honestly I don't see that as a viable option.  Also, The 7.9 amp motor feels a bit weak for a carpet cleaner.  Unfortunately, this isn't the perfect cleaner for multiple pet household with a lot of carpet.  Overall, while I found this cleaner capable I'm not sure I'd recommend it anyone based on our testing.  However, if you're in the market for a very basic carpet cleaner this should fit the bill.  I would recommend this vacuum to people living in carpeted apartments or smaller sized condos or homes but nothing larger, especially those with multiple pets, especially at the $260-$300 price point.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I buy sandpaper by the box, and have burned through many boxes. But only recently did a friend mention this adhesive-backed paper, and I'm glad he did. Durability-wise, it performs considerably better than regular sand paper, but what makes it so useful is the adhesive back. Here a few random points:\n1. Less waste - you adhere a piece to the face of your sanding block, and don't have to wrap any paper around the sides. Result - you use 100% of the paper for sanding\n2. For precise sanding, stick a piece of this paper at the very edge/corner/whatever of a sanding block, and you use the straight edge to get into tight corners, etc.\n3. Need a third hand? Stick a piece of the paper to a piece of wood and clamp that wood to your workbench. Then, for small pieces, use both hands to slide the piece back and forth over the flat (and immobile) sandpaper. Hint: cut a piece or two of the paper and adhere to the \"top side\" of the piece you are sanding. This gives you great grip on the top as you slide the piece back and forth over the horizontal paper. Update: I found an old sample floor tile - it was very smooth and now serves as a great flat sanding surface with adhesive sandpaper (plus I can clean off residual adhesive easily with lacquer thinner)\n\nEventually the \"stickyness\" gives out on the paper - especially for the \"gripping\" pieces mentioned above, after you swap them a few times. The grit is still good, but the pieces won't stick. I use them like regular paper then.\n\nI bought several different grits, and use both sides of several boards to stick on successive grits.", "label": 1}

{"text": "So, I order this kit.  Based on the other reviews, I was either expecting my mouth to be burned off or to have a great set of white chomppers.  So the day they arrived came (I'm in Iraq by the way), and the whole day I was pumping myself up for what I considered the inevetible agony I was going to go through, as discussed by many people on here.\nGot back to my room and got ready for battle.  Taking the advice of some on here, I only used half a vile on the top and bottom trays, want to wean myself onto the pain.... So... I put the trays in my mouth.  Closed my eyes and waited for the pain to start seering through my body and the foul taste of the gel (also reported) to make me throw up.  I also had a drool rag ready to go because it was also stated you would droll on yourself....... So I waited... and waited...\nAnd waited.  I then realized I wasn't feeling a thing!  I was kinda dissapointed in a way, but I figured, hey, great, lets get it on!  So, after cooling the other viles of gel (they had liquified due to the heat) back into a gel state, I set off to give me some perally whites!  I used a whole vile in the top and bottom tray and again, braced myself.  And again, NOTHING happened.  There wansn't even a tingling sensation.  It didn't taste bad either, nor did I drool.  Not at all.  I have no idea what those people were doing, but everyone is different.\nI went through 4.5 iterations for 20 minutes, with the 10 minute break in between.  The only semi-uncomfort, was when I was washing my mouth out, the inside of your lips will feel like they are overly chapped.  Not painful, just kinda icky.  But that goes away right quick.\nAfter the last bout, I slowly walked to the mirror, expecting white nasty spots all over my teeth that were mentioned here.  And again... nothing.  Not even a color change.  At this point I am wondering if I got a bum deal, but then I remembered a few people menionted that they look like nothing is different, and then in an hour or two it comes out.  So I went to sleep, thinking.. Sweet, tomorrow its on!\nMy alarm woke me up at 0330 as it always does, went to the mirror... and yeah.. no noticable difference.  Boooo to this I said.\nI give this a 2.  It didn't work, but it also didn't make me pass out from the pain.  I don't totally blame the product though.  It did say if the gel is melted to mail it back.  But being here, it coming melted is something I can't avoid and I don't have the time to mail it back.  That might have done something to it, you never know.  But yeah, I have some stips on the way from a friend and we'll see how thoes work.\nNo pain, no gain, no nothing!!

{"text": "Manual brushing can't achieve so many strokes/minute like the sonic type brushes. The result is they really work better than manual (just my experimental observation) - teeth are cleaner yet not as clean and smooth as after dental cleaning despite the marketing claims. Don't delude yourself - sonic brushes can't clean between the teeth despite the fantastic marketing claims about the 'ultrasonic technology' lol. You will need flosing, interdental brushes or better water jet for that. Sonic vibrating brushes are gentler on the gums compared to the rotating brushes.\n\nAfter using the sonicare brush for a month, I've replaced it with the CVS sonic brush which to my opinion cleans better - bigger brush and better contact with teeth. The only 'advantages' of sonicare is that its timer beeps every 30 seconds while the CVS timer just turns off the brush after 2 minutes of brushing (you can start it again to continue brushing) and sonicare has a charge indicator while CVS hasn't. The biggest advantage of CVS is the significantly lower price for the unit, which includes the charger, a UV sanitizer and 3 brush heads. The replacement CVS brush heads are way cheaper than the sonicare ones which appparently are made of gold, otherwise I can't understand why I am expected to pay $25-$35 for two plastic brush heads LOL\n\nThe thing I don't like about both sonicare and CVS brushes is that they don't use regular rechargable batteries so when their battery dies in a few years you will have to throw away the whole unit and get a new one.", "label": 2}

This new 4.5HP unit which I bought for my woodworking shop is a total waste of my money. The unit cannot even suck-up small chips of wood, I tried to suck-up one small pebble, 1/8\" in size at max. and it could not do it. I was very disappointed as I liked the fact that it can be hung on a wall yet was mobile if I wanted to move it around. I was unable to take up anything but the saw-dust and that even was a chore as I had to move the hose end with the attachment very slow. I tried using a 2.5\" hose thinking it was the small 1.25\" hose diameter, but that made it worst. The little 2.5HP unit I have for my models works better than this 4.5HP. I would love to get rid of it pronto. Do NOT buy this unit, you will be sorry you did. I do not know how some people gave this a 5 star rating even a 3 is too much. I had to give it 1 star because I am comparing it to other ShopVac units which I have in use, and I am extremely disappointed in it, especially since the HP rating is 4.5 and it is no were near the 4.0 my wife has, heck, even my 2.5 unit has more sucking power than this vacuum.

Interplak recommends you run the batteries down every 6 months and then do a full recharge before use again. Oral-B encourages you to keep the toothbrush on the charger all the time, as they claim \"there is no such thing as over-charging\". Interplak has a light that turns on to let you know it's charging, Oral-B does not. Interplak's charger is bulkier, but that's only because it has two ports for you to stick extra/replacement brushes on.\n2) Power: Interplak has decent power, but Oral-B is definitely more powerful, and very feisty.\n3) Replacement Brushes: To get the best cleaning quality from your electric toothbrush, you should replace the heads around every 3 months. Oral-B brush heads are a bit smaller, which is better for navigating around your mouth and \"precision cleaning\". Department stores are more likely to carry Oral-B replacements, but both are readily available online, and they go for around $5 to $10, depending.\n4) Function and use: Dentists recommend at least two minutes of brush time. Oral-B has a two-minute timer, signaled NOT by sound (like I thought), but by short, intermittent bursts, to let you know two minutes are up. This feature is on all the time and cannot be disabled. Interplak does not have this feature. Oral-B has a simple on/off toggle button. Interplak has two buttons - one for on, one for off.\n\nConclusion...\nPersonally, I recommend Oral-B over Conair.

Yes.  The fluid also continued to drip out the back which was frustrating.

This glue does make for a strong joint ( the durability seems to be there - time will tell ), but the \"use in a snap\" part was disappointing ( 20 minute working time and 90 minute dry time, humidity dependent and 1-4 hours under clamp ). I will compare this glue to expanding  foam. Once it dries, spray foam is the closest thing to it. It never really totally scrapes off, so sanding is necessary, and it is near impossible to figure out just how much to use and exactly where to apply because of the foaming process. I will not use this glue for fine and exposed jointery, I am pretty certain it works well and as advetised, but the \"ooze\" is something that I am not pleased with - sure it gets into tight places and fills voids, but by the time I scrape, sand and dig it out and off of everyting around it - it has taken me three times longer than with other products and my details do not seem as nice by then.

{"text": "I just moved into an apartment with a new synthetic carpet that sheds like a pack of afghan hounds; it choked my bagless vacuum in under a minute.  I needed a sturdy, no-frills, bagged vacuum like the Montgomery Ward upright I used for over 20 years before it died.\n\nThis model was almost identical, and now that I've had it for a few weeks, I'm happy as a clam.  It has an old-fashioned rotating brush/beater roller, 5 carpet height adjustments, great suction for 5 amps, and comes pre-fitted with a humongous disposable liner bag (type F&G), plus a spare belt for the roller.  Some parts that used to be steel have been replaced with thick plastic, but it seems plenty sturdy, and it's much lighter to maneuver and carry than my old all-steel model.  The on/off button and lock/unlock for the handle are both on the base, so they're foot controls; carpet height is adjusted by a dial on the front of the base.  The long cord (20 feet or so) doesn't retract, you just wind it over hooks on the handle.  The spring-attached fabric bag has a full-length zipper, inside which the disposable bag (which fills the cover from end to end) slides on with another spring.  Quick, simple.\n\nOne pass with this puppy picked up enough carpet fluff missed by the bagless to knit a throw rug, but there's still plenty of room left for future dirt.  It's also a lot less noisy than my smaller bagless.  The only qualm I had in buying this was the lack of attachments for cleaning upholstery & suchlike, but I found an inexpensive accessory kit made for it (crevice tool, round dust brush, upholstery brush, extension tubes, looooong flexible hose) right here on Amazon:  the \"Electrolux Home Care 60E 6-Piece Deluxe Tool Set,\"  so my joy is complete.\n\nThough the image on this page looks rather green, the vacuum is actually jet black, and the bag is a black-white-red random print.  It comes in a flat box, minor assembly required.  Highly recommended for those who remember how good the old vacuums were, don't want to spend a fortune just to clean their carpets, or are into retro styling.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Look these are Fluke leads and that should count for something.  Safety and build quality are top notch.  The safety rating on these leads is 1000V CAT III / 600V CAT IV.  That's pretty much top of the market, but not unique.  The probes themselves are a reasonable length with probe tips that are sharp.  The banana plugs have good shrouds and fit well.  So these will suit most any application and serve you well.  However what I don't like is the jackets.  These probes (TL75) hover around the $20 mark and the Fluke TL71's hover around the $25.  And yet when you unwind these out of the box, they retain that crinckle from being twist tied.  The TL71s do not due to being made of silicone rubber.  I find this to be very irritaing because it just promotes tangling and frustration especially in colder temperatures.  Which is bad when working on something that could kill you.  For $5 more you don't have this problem and get something of much higher quality.  To be honest even I would say I'm being too critical here if it wasn't for the fact that for around $7 I picked up a set of Sinometer knock-off of the TL71s that are almost as good as them!  And the key feature is they pretty well hang straight.  I was shocked!  I don't know what their made of but it's darn near tangle free.  Frankly put, I prefer them to the TL75s that came with my Fluke meters for usability.  But I will admit, that I trust the safety rating and quality of the TL75s more.  If these are ever changed to be made of the same silcone rubber as the TL71s, then these are 5 star leads in my opinion.  But as it stands, $20 for these is just too much.\n\nNote I've inlcuded a hanging comparison with the Sinometer's, the TL75s, and the TL71s on the main product page.", "label": 2}

Like someone else had stated in another review, my rug looks like new again. Also any other dirt etc was sucked up as well.. The suction is very good.. Assembly was easy... It comes with a disposable bag preinstalled and an extra belt.. Yes it has plastic and I would imagine \"stomping\" on the foot release (as another reviewer had stated) may potentially break the lever but why would you \"stomp\" on it anyway?

{"text": "I had two Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrushes over the last 4 years.  Sonicare works great and cleans your teeth well.  It is a bit bulky, noisy and vibrates a lot but you get used to that.  If you don't remove the brush head from the base after each use to clean the interior mold starts to build.  Not good.\n\nBesides, both Sonicare units I owned had the same problem.  After around 18 months the battery took less and less of a charge until after around 26 months I could only brush my teeth 4 to 5 times per charge.  Big problem if you travel a lot or when several people use the same base.  I called Sonicare about it and was told the base should last for up to 5 years.  Whatever, the warranty is only two years.\n\nSo I looked at other products and found the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete system.  The base is made by Braun in Germany.  I have owned 4 Braun electric shavers over the past 24 years.  The last one still worked fine when I replaced it 5 years ago but I wanted to upgrade to the new Activator.  So my experience with Braun products \"made in Germany\" and their reliability had been very good.\n\nThe Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete is lighter than the Sonicare Elite.  The Oral B toothbrush head is designed a bit different than the Sonicare.  After using the Oral B now for about 2 month I have the feeling that the Oral B cleans my teeth better and I think it is due to the difference in toothbrush design.\n\nThe Oral B sits essentially on a vibrating stick vs. the screw cap method used by Sonicare.  The vibrating stick seems better from a hygiene standpoint and creates a similar amount of vibration.\n\nAnother big difference between both systems is the cost of the brush heads.  3 replacement heads for Oral B Sonic Complete are $18 on Amazon; 2 brush heads for the Sonicare system are between $23 and $28 on Amazon.  Since the price for the base systems is similar the savings from the toothbrushes for the Oral B is quite substantial, especially if several people are using the system.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the Oral B system and even my dentist thinks there is no difference in terms of effectiveness between both systems.  Based on my experience with the Braun shavers I am hopeful the Oral B will last longer than the Sonicare.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought the \"old\" style Gorilla Glue a while back and had it for about 2 years. I used it a lot, and generally was happy with it. However, this is not a miracle adhesive and does have some limitations, which I'll go into later.\n\nThis is a polyurethane-based glue, the active ingredients are diphenylmethane diisocyanate and some other reactants, and are very similar to those in expanding polyurethane foam, or 2-part polyurethane used to make molds or rigid polyurethane foam for insulation. Like wood glue, it reacts with moisture in the air, and just like poly foam, it expands when curing. It doesn't contain any aromatic hydrocarbons or suspended solvents like toluene, heptane, or acetone, or alcohols, so it's non-flammable and relatively safe as it doesn't produce strong and dangerous fumes. It does have a funk to it though, but not obnoxious.\n\nIt works pretty good, but that largely depends on a couple factors. One is the surface it's being applied to, and the other is the type of application. Gorilla Glue by nature doesn't have good tensile strength and isn't very strong in shearing-type loads. When it cures, it gets frothy and expands to 3x's it's original volume, so that can cause problems with joints that shift when it dries. The surface prep is important, like any adhesive. It doesn't work good on bright, shiny surfaces like steel or plastic, and works best on porous things like wood, concrete, fabric or unglazed ceramics. If using it on steel or plastic, you need to sand the surface to rough it up to get the best bond.\n\nI used this to secure the little nobbles that go on the bottom of the toilet seat, and they came off within a couple weeks. I used it to glue the stock back on my stepson's wood and metal replica rifle, and it broke in a month. So I was pretty disappointed with it. It worked great on wood and some pottery, but didn't work when I glued the handle back on a mug that broke off. The trick is to firmly clamp the bonded items together or the glue will expand and compromise the joint. The frothy glue isn't resistant to shearing loads, unlike something like a hard epoxy (JB Weld, etc.), but works good when used to bond items with good surface area contact. The less surface area bonded, the weaker the bond. If you have a small surface to bond to, it's better to get hard epoxy.\n\nIt's pretty easy to use, just apply a small amount of glue (a little goes a long ways) and clamp or compress the surfaces being bonded together. It helps to moisten the surfaces being bonded. You need to be cautious and clamps are important as the glue will expand and try to push the pieces apart. When the glue dries, it expands and will leak out everywhere if you use too much of it, so be cautious and not liberal in applying it. There may be some extrusion from the joints, but that's normal. You can scrape it off with a knife blade or sand it off. It is messy, sticky, and won't clean off with soap and water. Acetone, paint thinner, or alcohol are the only cleaners that will work.\n\nPros\n\nStrong bonds when used correctly\nDoesn't contain toxic chemicals\nNon flammable\nWaterproof\n\nCons\n\nNeeds meticulous surface prep on nonporous mediums\nLow tensile strength\nExpands when curing\nRequires solvents for clean up\n\nSo Gorilla Glue is a good product. Perfect for wood and pottery and stone, but requires extra attention on steel and plastic. Overall, I'd prefer a 2-part epoxy over this just because it doesn't expand and makes a stronger bond and resists lateral loads better.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is a great idea, but as a guy who is currently in the middle of residing his house with Hardie planks, I can see a flaw inherent in this product. Although the hardie planks are a manufactured products, all hardie planks of the same width, are not actually the same width. In fact of the 280 planks I bought that are all supposed to be 6-1/4 wide (to get the 5-inch reveal) some are 6-1/4, some are more like 6-1/8, and some are more like 6-3/8. So if you measure the 1-1/4 down from the top as these guages do, you are not always going to get a 5-inch reveal. James Hardie, What's up with that? This is a demonstratable truth. To get an equal 5-inch reveal, you really need to measure 5 inches up from the bottom of each plank. You may not really care if some of your planks have a 4-7/8 reveal, and others have a 5-1/4 reveal, and others get the 5-inch. You may in fact be using these planks on a spec house in the burbs that you can't see from your house. I can see my siding from my house, and I do want to get a 5-inch reveal on all my siding.\n\nI realize James Hardie says you MUST have a 1-1/4 overlap on all boards, but James ought to make a more consistant product.

{"text": "I bought this product with absolutely no expectations. It was a good price and I had never tried whitening products before. The first issue I encountered was shaping the trays. Using hot tap water doesn't really work. You have to heat it in the microwave for a little bit for it to really shape the trays. Two hours doesn't really sound like a long time, but with trays in your mouth and saliva building up, it gets rather uncomfortable. I tried lying on the couch on my back to stop the saliva from building up in my mouth; bad idea. It worked on session fine, but I tried it again and some of the gel dripped down my throat. It makes you sick to your stomach and gave me really intense heartburn a few hours later. My best results were with just spitting in the sink every 7-10 minutes. I didn't have issues with tooth sensitivity, but it really does burn your gums. I didn't start feeling it until the end of my third tray. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I did finish the last tray, but it literally felt like someone had taken coarse sand paper to my gums. The next day brushing my teeth, even while being careful about my gums, they started to bleed. I tried using less gel, but there's not really any way to prevent it from dripping out of the trays and onto your bottom gums. As for the effectiveness, it did work, but it wasn't drastic. For the amount of discomfort you have to endure, I'm not sure if the results justify it. But it does work, so if you're willing to tough it out for noticeable but minimal results, go for it.", "label": 2}

This sandpaper lasts considerably longer, is much, much stronger and you simply cut it to size, stick one layer on the pad of your sander as a base, then add another layer,  clip them in and away you go. Not only that, it makes your pads last 10X longer as well. When it's worn out, remove it (I find it helps to let a few layers of sandpaper build up on the pad). This will save you a fortune in throw away single sheets and OK, it doesn't have any holes in it so you won't be collecting much dust - but then do you really anyway? Saves time, works better and saves a fortune in the long run. Does a much better job too and if you ever need a small piece for hand sanding, simply cut a sheet to the desired size, fold it over and stick it to itself and again, it won't slip, you won't be tearing it or cursing at it, you'll be able to get into those tight corners and the job will be done so much better in half the time!

{"text": "I liked this can at first because it's very solid, sturdy and well made. However, I have stopped using it and will take it to the hazmat disposal site. Here's why:\n\nFirst: The can is VERY hard to hold while pouring. It would require three hands to do it right, and I only have two. The plastic lid-opening handle is too far forward to reach with the fingertips of the hand that's holding the can by its welded-on steel handle. You have to pull the lid handle back with one hand first, with the can on the ground, and then, with the lid open, slip the thumb of your other hand under the steel handle and grab the lid handle with your fingertips.\n\nAlthough that's extremely awkward, it's sort of a necessary safety feature with this potentially dangerous can. It requires you to release pressure in the can before lifting it. If you don't open the lid until the can is tilted, you can get a forceful spray of gasoline over the top of the funnel onto whatever is in front of you, like a hot mower engine.\n\nBut pouring the gasoline is very cumbersome anyway, because there's nothing to grip with the other hand to tilt the can except for the thin bottom edge. You're trying to pour and watch for overflows with one hand doing two tasks and the other trying to tilt the heavy can full of gasoline without a secure way to do it. It's just way more trouble and dangerous than it's worth.\n\nSecond: It's IMPOSSIBLE to empty the can with the funnel in place. The can has to be tilted so far forward that you're pouring over, not onto, the far edge of the funnel. Unless you take off the funnel, you'll never get out the last half gallon or so of gas.\n\nThis design looks smart, but the open but attached funnel is very hard to use and could easily be very dangerous. I went back to using my four-year-old&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/No-Spill/dp/B000W72GBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">No-Spill</a>&nbsp;can, which is a hundred times easier to use and very much safer.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I honestly can't remember what I had in mind when I bought this, but I do remember what I ended up using it on.

This glue cures almost instantly, so it doesn't give you time to position whatever you are gluing down. A couple months later I went to change the battery again, and the glue had become hard as a rock. I basically had to chip away at it.\n\nSo anyways this glue is not good for everything, but I am sure it is good for some things. It is very strong and will fill gaps. It is hard and rigid when it cures, not soft. I believe other cyanoacrylate glues are similar, so these properties are not why I rated it less than 5. I gave it 3 stars because months later, my phone still smelled like vinegar. I don't have experience with other cyano glues, but I don't think the smell is supposed to last so long.

In the case of my drill press, for instance, it was a last resort... I'd tried everything else first (measuring for runout, etc.).  Yet, the problem what apparently the joint in my old black nylon belts.  Do yourself a favor and try these belts BEFORE you spend a lot of time looking for the problem elsewhere.  They're an upgrade in almost every case!  They're not cheap, but if they solve your problem and improve your machine, they're worth it!\nBe safe!", "label": 1}

The make-up of the V Belt is rather simple but ingeniouis, lending itself to be easily shortened (I had to remove two links to keep it from touching the belt guard support on my saw). Here is the real rub (sorry) , if you do a search for these belts, to find the best price, you will find a huge spread in the pricing.

Well, similar no, stronger, COMPLETELY!  To the point that it put blisters on my gums that lasted 2 days.\n\nI followed directions but the solution migrates onto the gum line slightly even if you are careful . I put in the trays for the first 20 minute session.  I felt my teeth were getting a bit sensitive and the manufacturer states is a normal side effect.  15 minutes following into the second 20 minute session, a  burning sensation started at the gumline and was too uncomfortable for me to continue.  After rinsing my mouth out I saw how red my gums were, and my teeth hurt terribly.  I noticed the little blisters forming within minutes after that and called the company because I thought it was a severe reaction for a home use product.\nPlease use with caution if you want to try this home bleaching system, but consider the other alternative products out there that are safer.

{"text": "I bought this vacuum cleaner to supplement my vacuuming with a full size canister vacuum with all the attachments.  I wanted it for quick vacuuming jobs in between.  It was extremely important to have the 6 levels of height for the frieze carpet I have (Mohawk SmartStrand Silk). My older canister vac has 4 settings but this is even better.  The only thing I had to get used to is moving it back and forth.  The first time I vacuumed, on pulling it back towards me, the front was dipping a little bit low and the vacuum is so great that the carpet actually visibly raised up.  I think I have it down now after just a few vacuums.  Because of allergies, I also purchased HEPA filter bags along with this Eureka.  I am happy that it was simple to assemble, easy  to use, won't beat up my carpet (now that I have the knack for forward/back motion) and will definitely keep my rug cleaner because I am more apt to vacuum more often because of it's ease vs. hauling out the canister vac and dragging it around.", "label": 1}

But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action--she showed me the linear ridges it has made in my gums.  I don't apply alot of pressure when brushing, so this was upsetting, especially since the damage is permanent.  She'd been trying to get me to switch to the Oral B for ages, so when my sister-in-law (also a hygienist) recommended the Oral B, I went out and got one.  The circular action doesn't wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner.  Even though I floss every day, I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare.  With the Oral B, it's gone.  And with the variety of brushing styles that automatically switch when you change a brush head (several options are included!), it's a lot more bang for your buck.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Good:  Absolutely NO gas smell (put my nose up to spout) after 4.5 gal fill and 1 mile drive home.  Short wide design does not tip easily.\n\nNotes:  1) I purposely left it in the sun, and it  developed gas smells around spout (would have been very surprised if it did not).  2) As noted in other reviews, it can develop pressure inside the can, so open the spout while the can is flat first before positing it to pour  again, this is expected with the high level of spout seal.  3) Although rated for 5 gal. I do not think anything more than 4.5 gal is safe.  4.5 gal fills to the bottom of the spout (see pressure note).\n\nBad:  Attached plastic pour spout needs to be removed to fill with gas.  The plastic spout leaks horribly around where it attaches to the gas can, drooling gas down the side of the can in every pouring position from careful to fast.  I now detach the pour spout and use it like a funnel, but that is not possible with about half of my needs  not long before the now non-attached spout is lost.  Pouring from the can directly to a gas tank was very messy and wasteful sloshing gas all over.  If the gas can metal spout itself was a few inches longer, it would fill 95% of my needs.\n\nVery Very Bad (for my needs):  I was looking for a gas can I could take in a float plane and then transfer to a backwoods fishing boat.  The spout cover is held down only by a spring.  This is a terribly dangerous can, because that seal does not lock, so I can open the seal by just pushing it with my finger or it tips and hits something.  Seeing it tipped over and dumping its entire contents was very very scary.  Admittedly, this is rare, but my old smelly drippy plastic cans NEVER failed like that.  If the seal on this gas can would lock like a REAL NATO can, it would be great.  My gas can search for this need continues.\n\nBottom line:  This gas can is good, but an improved spout and positive locking cap would be huge improvements.  Great smell improvement for caring it in a trunk (dont overfill).  Other than that, I don't see where it is any safer than the stupid new plastic cans for most users needs.

I was tired of constantly taking the vacuum apart to clean the accumulation of hair as well as the cup looking filthy.  I am taking this apart more often than those.  I am of the belief that it is not picking up any more hair.  The way this machine was built the hair is getting built up around the areas where the belt is connected ( 2 different spots) and around the areas where the brush fits in (2 different spots).  It is causing the belt and the fittings around the end of the roller/brush to heat up.  I then have to wait for everything to cool down before I open the machine to unfurl the hair that has collected .  It is a struggle to line up the brush in the grooves due to the slant of the grooves and how tight it fits.  Some good qualities are that it is easier to take apart and I do not have to empty a cup that consistently looks awful.

Here are some reminders to keep in your mind before you wanna buy it!\n1. The Comfy-tray in this product will not mold well and fit tightly to your teeth after your repeat the step to to shape it again. This can cause one of the worst thing ever that the chemical can flow to your gums and hurt it b/c the trays do not fit well.\n2. In the instruction list, they said that \"Each ampule contains enough gel for one application. Use one for the upper tray and one for the lower tray\". This will be over the chemical in the tray if you use one ampule for 1 tray at one time, and that will be damage to your gums. Like me, my gums was burned and swollen when i tried to apply whole ampule in to one tray. So i recommend use only one ampule for both tray, and use this product for 2 times of whitening total of 4 hours (may be 2 weeks for one application). In this way, you will save the ampules for next whitening and will not damage your gums and teeth. (also money :)\n3. After whitening, your teeth may hurt a little bit base on the chemical contact with the teeth and gums, so please don't worry, it will be gone after a few days.\n4. In case of Swollen Gums after using this product, PLEASE stop using this product until your gums being well.

{"text": "While the slots for each size seem accurate enough to their corresponding decimal thickness (use a caliper if you really need something reliable), it is important to understand gauge sizes.  This is based on the 1893 US Standard which is out of date unless you are only looking at stainless steel sheets.  You can do your own research on their origins and differences (link below), but most manufacturers, welding machines, etc use the Manufacturers Standard Gauge in their references.  Therefore, while this handy little tool will say that 16ga is 0.0625\" (per US Standard), your Miller welding machine and Miller's pocket thickness gauge will use 0.0598\" for 16ga.  Admittedly, this is literally about the width of a hair but if you are measuring something, you should at least know why there is a difference.  Just keep in mind that if using the gauge numbers alone the US Standard is slightly thicker than the Manufacturers Standard for the same gauge.  This is why ASTM A480-10a contains the statement, \"The use of gage number is discouraged as being an archaic term of limited usefulness not having general agreement on meaning.\"\n\nWith all that said, it would be nice if General Tools would offer a gauge that contained the more common Manufacturer's Standard.\n\nInteresting short article about the difference between US and Manufacturer's Standards\nhttps://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070306163511AAPyeYU", "label": 2}

At first I was concerned about filling but I clean the abrasive with just a shop vac as I'm working on the material, rust, paint, most everything comes off the paper easily.

It is so strong I found it difficult to remove from the glass.  I use a heat gun now to peal the paper then follow with paint thinner or similar mild solvent and a razor scraper to remove the residue.  Most or all of the adhesive comes off the paper in my case and it is messy to clean up.  It is very infrequent in my case to need to change the paper.

The head swives around and so do the 2 indicators. Movement is smooth. Downside is plastic knobs. It will eventually strip . Again you get what you pay for.

{"text": "Like the Elenco ST74&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ST74-AC-Line-Splitter/dp/B0002I118K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ST74 AC Line Splitter</a>, this product has a X1 and X10 current loop transformer and a line / neutral banana jack for measuring voltage.\n\nYou can read my review on the ST74 for the advantage of having a X10 loop to use with your meter, but this design lacks some desirable features found on the ST74.\n\nI should point out that both products insist on hanging from the outlet supplying power.  This is fine for a new, high quality outlet, but often problems happen with old, worn out jacks that barely grip a heavy cord.  Remember that the outlet must support both these devices and the weight of your amp clamp.\n\nThe missing features here are:\n\n1 - there is no banana jack for \"EARTH/GROUND\".  Since outlets can be miswired, or have an open earth connection, this is an important line to be able to probe safely.  The ST74 has this jack\n\n2 - the output jack to your appliance is ONLY for the US standard.  This is fine most of the time, but on the rare chance you need to test a foreign plug, the \"UNIVERSAL\" jack on the ST74 will let you plug almost any power cord into it.\n\n3 - Finally the ST-74 costs a little less.  I do think this is better built than the ST-74, but that's just from \"feel\" of the product.  Both products \"hang\" off the power outlet you put them into and lack a 6\" or 12\" power cord, which would be nice to accommodate inconveniently located outlets or outlets that won't support the extra weight of a current transformer + amp clamp.  I would give this 4 stars if it had a power cord and 5 stars if it had a ground jack as well as the line and neutral.  I've seen too many worn out power outlets that won't hold onto an adapter plus an amp clamp.\n\nIf you don't care to measure ground impedance, don't think you'll ever work on foreign power cord devices, and have some more money, then its fine for you.  But the ST-74 still does more for less and is a better value.", "label": 2}

{"text": "Propylene Glycol (PG) present in some toothpastes, and mouthwashes, is a chemical that your Toyota recognizes. It is an antifreeze, and you probably know that  antifreeze (used in countries that experience winter) has killed many cats and dogs that have lapped it up.\n\nPG is used as a wetting agent in toothpaste and mouthwash, but it is so readily absorbed into the skin that the EPA requires anyone working around it to wear goggles and protective clothing. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) warns against skin contact because PG has systemic consequences, such as brain, kidney, and liver abnormalities.\n\nHowever, no such warning is required on underarm deodorants, toothpastes, or other products containing PG. Does the use of PG in toothpaste, for use in an area where its readily absorbed, seem logical to you?\n\nIn high concentration, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), an extremely alkaline substance, destroys protein instantly. In the mouth, it dissolves oral soft tissues, imparting a sick feeling. Dissolving off the protein with NaOH is not the way I want my patients to get clean teeth yet many dentists use these products to clean their patients teeth.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in cleansers to dissolve oil and grease and in personal products as a thickener. PEG is a potential carcinogenic substance that, when used on the skin, alters its natural moisture factor, leaving the skin vulnerable to aging and invasion by harmful bacteria, PEG has no logical therapeutic benefit in toothpastes, but it is in quite a number of them.", "label": 0}
{"text": "A design that has stood the test of time....The Eureka 1934B works very well because of it's design.  The design of this vacuum has been around since the 60's & for good reason.  The air path is simple, it does not have a lot of complicated bends & turns like most of todays \"clean air\" uprights.  This vacuum only uses 5 amps of power.  More than enough to get carpet clean.  The brushroll has one row of brushes & one row of beater bars.  Again because of this, it gently but effectively grooms the carpet & removes sand & dirt.  I was amazed at how much dust & dirt was in the bag after vacuuming.  The bags are simple & easy to change.  Suction & airflow are very good with this vacuum.  It is lightweight & easy to move.  It is a bit quieter than most of todays vacuums because of the 5 amp motor vs 12 amps on most vacuums today.  Most of the sound volume comes from the motor fan.  Much like a hand drill has. This vacuum is best suited for use on carpets only, not hard floors or tool use.  I have a canister vacuum I use for above floor cleaning.  A duo that works well for me.  Belts & bags are very easy to find for this vacuum.  I use the F & G Filteraire bags to help keep allergens in check.  Take some time each month to check this vacuum over & change bags & it will take care of you for many years like mine has.  I just bought another one for use downstairs. A very good vacuum worthy of your consideration.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I haven't owned a file before but I've seen some pretty \"fancy\" files. I know there are some files on the market with wooden handles and all that extra stuff (adding the to cost of the item). This file is one piece of steel. The handle is not very long but it's only an 8 inch file to begin with. Most of the length is the working area. Some reviewers have whined about wanting a better handle or wrapping stuff around the handle to make it all soft and comfy for them. Honestly, this file is so light (and only 8 inches long) that you don't need any special grip or padding. So light you don't even really need to use 2 hands to work it, I've been able to use it with only one hand.\n\nWhen I first got it out of the package, I grabbed a dull hatchet I had in the garage. This file is very sharp. I was able to sharpen that hatchet back to a working edge in only 12 strokes. I use the hatchet for wood. I'm not a fantasy-land Viking, Templar Knight, or Barbarian...I'm not concerned with slicing paper with my hatchet or throwing it into a wall. It literally took me about 12 strokes to get a hatchet that couldn't make kindling from a dry log back to having a sharp working edge.\n\nSharp enough to get the work done quickly (e.g. only 12 strokes on a blade), light weight, small and easy to store. Good price. What's not to like? Well, ok, there may be one thing not to like--the finishing. When this file arrives, you should brush it down with a wire brush or rub it with another file or some sandpaper. I got 2 metal slivers in my hand from the handle. So be careful and wear gloves and/or get the burrs off this file before you use it.\n\nThis is ideal for putting a sharp working edge on your heavy working hand tools like lawn mower blades, axes/hatchets, machetes, pretty much anything made for chopping as well as other metal items such as steel pipes, etc. If this were lost or stolen, I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.", "label": 1}

(I have a fair amount of experience with different glue material)  This is actually shameful given the cost (and quality) of this product, the various ways it can used or not used, that it can be very strong or not given certain circumstances, can be dangerous, etc.  They provide different thicknesses but it is unclear when you need what thickness except by trial and error (and it is too expensive for that).  They provide these stopper needles (if that is what they are) but no indication of how or why they should be used or even that they are stopper units (maybe they aren't!) The spray unit is provided with a plastic cover but, if used, will not fit back into the case!  Since this stuff is somewhat dangerous (as they say) and expensive, I would not want to leave the plastic cover off and taking the spray unit on and off would be messy and dangerous.  As glue, I have had several cases where the glued parts came apart where maybe the pieces weren't completely clean, were exposed to heat, or I didn't use the right thickness maybe.  This caused me to lose trust in the glue.  Lastly, like all glues of this type (super glues), you have to be extremely careful not to get an on your hands, especially since the activator runs easily.

{"text": "Dap seems to have improved something in this, because I remember it being very difficult to work with a few years ago, and I stopped using it for another product, and found myself trying this again.  It's definitely more workable right out of the container.  Window glazing is a learned skill, and a lot of the Youtube videos show this being done without doing some of the vital prep work that is vital.  I've re-glazed most all of my 100-year old wooden windows with Dap 33 several years ago and everything is holding together well.  It's not as easy as simply applying new putty over the old dried putty, if you do that, it won't last.\n\nTools are as important as the prep.  If you can get the sash out of the window frame and take it to a workbench, your job will be much easier.  For a lot of cases, that just isn't feasible.  I like to use the Hyde bent putty knife for applying and tooling the putty.  However, any 2-in-1 window glazing tool with the straight blade on one end and the V-shaped blade on the other works just as well.  The key is having a bend, it helps.  A regular straight 1.5\" semi-flex knife helps apply the bedding.  The \"window repair knife\" by Warner Tools is a semi flex knife with an angled edge, it works fantastic at removing old putty.  I personally prefer the #2 triangular glaziers points, and they require the Fletcher point driver.  But, if you're just a DIYer replacing one or two panes, you can get the #7 points that can be pushed in with a 2-in-1 tool.\n\nThe first thing to do is scoop everything out of the container and knead and roll it around in your hands to mix everything and warm it up.  Do that for at least 5 minutes.  For prep, a heat gun and scraper makes getting the old putty out of the sash.  When the sash rabbet is cleaned out and the glass is removed, primer it with any oil-based primer.  This is important not only because it gives the putty something to stick to, but it will be the barrier between the wood and the putty.  Put some furniture oil on an old piece of wood.  See how quickly it absorbs it?  That's what will happen to the putty if you skip this step!  You don't want the wood to absorb the oil out of the putty, or it will fail very quickly.  Once the sash is primed, set a thin bead of putty on the front part of the rabbet.  This forms a pillow to cushion the glass.  Then set your glass in.  Use your points to hold it in the frame.  Now its time to apply the putty.  When all is said and done, I've had it take 1-2 weeks to skin over enough to be painted.  This curing time seems to be about on par with Glazol and the other readily available products.", "label": 1}

{"text": "So my long-time lemur buddy Dave and I were on a normal walkabout down by Big Lick creek when all of a sudden a chunk of interplanetary space debris about the size of your average house cat blazed through the noon sky and fell into our path. Well in his haste to avoid being pulverized into crispy little lemur bits, Davey boy attempted a maneuver that only a gibbon should try. Let's face it, Dave is no gibbon, thus he got his tail stuck between a rock and a hard place breaking it almost clean in two. While I fashioned a make-shift splint from young poplars and kudzu vines, I assured him everything would be alright since I always keep a bottle of Gorilla glue in my truck.\n\nOnce back at the truck I quickly made work of setting Dave's tail back in place. I wet both ends of his tail per the directions on the bottle. I then stuck the ends together and wrapped his makeshift splint back in place to allow time for the glue to bond. Maybe it was the kudzu, but 24 hours later the glue still had not bonded! I was so upset and so was Dave. We just couldn't understand why it didn't work, since he even helped me use the Gorilla glue to replace a torn ear for Steve, a really good bonobo friend of his. We had great success with Steve's ear, so my conclusion is that the Gorilla glue is fine for Hominidae, but not so good for Prosimians. Thanks for reading.\n\nSPO", "label": 2}

{"text": "Gorilla Glue eight ounce size.\nMost of us have been in a home repair situation that just keeps getting worse the more you get into it. When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just \"do it right\" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.\n\nI had a small problem that quickly spiraled into a carpenters truck payments. I had a loose toilet. Not a big deal right. Tried to usual tighter down the loose bolts. No help they just kept turning, which means the terrible and dreaded WOOOOOD ROTTTTTT.\nYes Houston we have a problem. The tiolet flange that holds it in place was rotten from some sneaky water leak somewhere not visible. This insidious leak had taken its toll and caused great damage under the bathroom tile.\n\nIn comes repair guy 1 then second opinion guy. Remedy; You gotta take that toilet out, bust out all that floor tile, cut out the sub floor, put in new sub floor, put in new tile, new toilet flange, and re set toilet then grout everything. Estimate to \"Do It Right\" nearly two grand. Since you have a carpenter, then a tile guy, then a plumber guy. My heart sank as I knew how much cash I had at the time.\n\nMy thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side. If only I could just shoer this thing up where it would be stable. I wish I could just shoot something in there that would fix everything and not go in debt.\n\nHow about Gorilla Glue. No that would just make a bigger mess. No here me out this might work. No it won't Gorilla Glue expands and will screw up everything. All this was the conversation i was having with myself in my head.\n\nOk lets do this but how to get it under the toilet. I took the bottle of glue and went to the hose department at home depot and found some clear plastic hose that would fit on the end.\n\nThe process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.\n\nThe attack. Hose on bottle, one side of toilet is lifted, hose inserted, squeezing and not much is happening as this glue is thick. Plan B, set glue bottle on floor use foot pressure. Eureka we have glue flow. Pumped about two ounces all around the toilet. Luckily the high pressure from my foot did not make the hose come off and get all over my shoes and the outside of the toilet.\n\nOk ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.\n\nAll in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base. The choice was either eight bucks for the glue, or nearly two grand that could better be used for other things like beer, new flat screen tv, taking the wife out to dinner sixty times, or other electronic man toys.\n\nThis glue saved me. In life you come across small things that work their way your heart for how well they help you or serve a purpose. Your uses and millage of course may vary. Good luck always.", "label": 1}

So when I heard about the 2 hour whitening kit I was like YES! Time saving! I also saw the price was discounted here so I decided to try it.

My teeth where not nearly as white as I wanted them to the bottoms still had that yucky off white color I hate the most so stupid me decided to try the last treatment after my mouth felt better from the first try and this time I didn't even last FIVE minutes before I had to pull the trays off from the pain!

{"text": "Overall, I've been somewhat happy with this vacuum, but the hose has a somewhat severe flaw in that the inner diameter of the hose abruptly decreases significantly at the connection between the hose and the canister.  This is exactly where your garbage will clog.  Any job I do seems to involve several unclogging breaks, especially if the debris is on the large size.\n\nThe corrugated hose has a fitting that plugs *into* the hose, which decreases the inner diameter.  All the junk that was able to traverse the entire length of the substantial hose now comes to an abrupt halt in the last inch of the hose.  A better design would have had the fitting *around* the hose so the inner diameter wouldn't change.  Seems like it would have been easy to do, since the fitting is under negative pressure and therefor unlikely to pop off in any circumstance.\n\nThe advertisement shows a guy vacuuming sawdust -- the perfect application for this; sawdust is too small to clog anything.  Try to vacuum up a few leaves, however, and they will shoot through 20 feet of hose only to get stuck *just* before they get to the canister.  It's quite irritating to see a great vacuum hurt by this one simple-to-fix flaw.", "label": 0}

Those disposable wrap around paper filters that go over the foam sleeve clog up way too fast. Another problem is that housing just below the motor that is supposed to hold the foam sleeve directly interferes with the inlet leaving no room even if there was a tall bag that could reach the bottom of the vacuum offering support as debris collects and not putting pressure on the bag opening.

In a nutshell, this is what is wrong with this brush: The bristles are too long and when you vacuum with it they have a tendency to clump together in the center. This restricts the suction space and amount of suction. If you have pet hair it balls up and doesn't even reach inside the brush so it can go up into the hose and into the vacuum because the bristles of the brush block it and lots of other things you try to vacuum up.

{"text": "In a nutshell:\n\nPROS:\n1) Actually whitens teeth well.\n\nCONS:\n1) Too abrasive. Erodes mouth tissue.\n\nNow the details:\n\nI bought this product after reading so many good reviews about it. One problems others have noted already is the lack of a measuring cup to know how much 10mL really is. Nevertheless, I used the product exactly as the directions instructed, gargling the mouthwash for a minute, once in the morning and once in the night after brushing my teeth, and not eating or drinking anything for the following 30 minutes. I followed this regimen for a little after a week, and already began to notice the whitening effect. During the next few days, however, my mouth began to hurt, and I started spitting out bits of what I thought was food during the 30 minutes after I gargled the mouthwash. I was actually spitting out bits of my gum. I immediately stopped using the mouthwash, but different parts of my mouth was already raw as top layers of my gum were stripped off, and it took more than week for it to finally heal. I might just be a lot more sensitive to the chemicals in the Rembrandt mouthwash than most other people are, but Rembrandt products are known to be a LOT more abrasive than others. For me, this cons heavily outweighs the pros. I would go for a safer mouthwash, even if the whitening effects may take longer to kick in.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Background you can skip\nI am experienced in laying laminate floors as I always chose to go that route with our past homes. Our current home, however, had a partial hardwood floor installed... and the rest was carpet of the brand 'Nasty'. So that had to go. Ripping out the 700 sq ft of Bruce Hardwood flooring would be a nightmare given that it was stapled and and I also felt it would be capital destruction as it is valuable and pretty.\nSo I opted to buy another 2000+ sq ft of hardwood and finish what the previous owners started.\n\nOnce I started witht he diningroom I noticed something that I never really experienced with Laminate... it was a pain to keep the boards tight and then once you had them tight you had to KEEP them tight while hammering. I tried all the online suggestions: using planks, boards, wedges, scalpels and what have you to create leverage to get the board together but , although it does work, I could not believe the job would be finished quickly and professionally. I needed something better and I assumed that someone MUST HAVE thought of a solution.\n\nAnyways, I am a quick learner and a search on Amazon put me in touch with this baby, the QuikJack.\n\nAbout this item\nAmazon got it to me overnight (i heart Prime Membership) and I lost little time.\nThe item is pretty big and sturdy. It is a specially designed Jack that leaves your hands free to operate your cleat nailer (I bought a pneumatic one, LOOOOVE IT!!).\nAs you can see from the pictures: you can create lots of easy configs and floorpositions for this jack. I did not nail it in but used a stud that was offset against the wall for leverage. Worked SUPERFAST. I think I went 10x faster than the manual solution. This was truly worth every penny I spent on it.\n\nPros\n0 Heavy duty, will last forever\n0 Well designed by pros so that you really can see it is for everyday use\n0 Spoiler alert: spoils the user so that you can no longer do without!!\n\nCons\n0 Little pricey compared to tighthening clamps\n\nConclusion\nI agree with other reviewers: this is a MUST HAVE tool. Not a nice to have. I cannot imagine having to put a floor in without this combined wiht my pneumatic nailer. You might need more than 1 to be even more efficient, but 1 is sufficient if need be. Pro installers that do this for a living probably use more than 1.\n\nLOVE IT.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Ah... the search to find a gas can that pours without making a mess.  Unfortunately, this one isn't it. At least it wasn't for me.\n\nIt is sturdy and I like the positive, spring-loaded, rubber-gasketed lid but filling is awkward (why not have a way to hold the lid open?). Most importantly, I couldn't pour without spilling some gas no matter how I tried.\n\nThe funnel is nearly useless, unless you don't mind gas dribbling down the side of the can and onto your machinery or the ground. The problem is that the funnel doesn't seal around the spout and even with careful pouring to try to keep the flow of gas beyond the funnel-spout connection, some fuel finds its way there and seeps through the \"seal\" and down along the side of the can.  I tried taking the funnel off, using it in the traditional way, but still some fuel inevitably would spill down the spout aand the side of the can.  The spout is just too short and wide to allow spill-less pouring, especially with a big, awkward can like this.\n\nAddendum to the review of 2-27-12:\nI realize that this can has received many very favorable reviews and therefore maybe the leaking I experienced was due to a defective  funnel or can.  It may be that I just didn't have the funnel snapped in place fully-I don't know I don't own it anymore to check. Maybe some others tolerate a bit of dribble down the can-I don't want any leaking.\n\n I might, actually be inclined to try this can again.  I wanted to like it.  I'm now using a plastic Blitz that works without leaking unless it's turned completely upside down-then it leaks a tiny bit-so I've learned to avoid this) but it's very slow to pour, swells or shrinks alarmingly with temperature variations, emits fuel odors, and has a whiz-bang safety lever/nozzle that looks very fragile and is a real pain to use.\n\n12-12-14:\nI finally bought a  5 gallon plastic Tuff Jug when I got tired of the slow pour and leaking of the Blitz can with the complex and fragile safety spout.  I like the Tuff Jug with its simple spring loaded shutoff that is opened when the nozzle edge is pushed against the edge of an opening. It pours very fast and is easy enough to use, though you do have to tip the can nearly completely upside down for filling an upright opening. This takes some muscle for a near 40# can of fuel. I have an adapter extension for use in my particular equipment and the can does leak very slightly by the end of the pour.  I think this is because the adapter is a snap-on hard plastic product and may not seal completely. However the leakage is very slight and tolerable for me.  I suspect that the can wouldn't leak without the extra nozzle attachment (not needed by most). Like all plastic cans, the Tuff Jug shrinks and swells with temperature changes, though not as much as the typical thin walled cans. Metal cans have the advantage in this regard.\n\nThe Tuff Jug is constructed of very sturdy looking plastic and is kind of expensive but probably priced fairly for its ruggedness. I've not had the Tuff Jug long enough, however,  to judge the durability.\n\nI've also used No Spill cans with good results.

{"text": "With thirty-five nearly all positive reviews I was wondering what I could say that would add to them.  Well, this is what I came up with:  The biggest most positive thing I can think of (that no one else has yet mentioned) is that this belt will not \"flat spot\" if allowed to sit unused for a period of time. Add to that the other attributes that other reviewers HAVE mentioned and you have one really neat little piece of engineering here.\n\nMy neighbor has a Delta table saw and the first time I helped him use it the weather was cold.  Add to that, his saw sits more often than not.  When he turned it on after weeks of not being used it vibrated terribly.  He said that it would settle down \"after a while, after it warmed up.\" Well it did... and it didn't.\n\nTo make a long story short, after assembling my Jet I put the factory belt on and ran the saw a few times.  It had a vibration too with it's brand NEW belt!  After it sat for a few days unused (hey, it was Christmas time) the vibration got worse.  Since I had always intended to try the Power Twist on it it seemed as if there were no time like the present, so I ordered one before I'd had to do ANY important cuts with the saw.\n\nFirst of all it was cold when I tried to size the belt and so it wasn't that easy.  On the other hand it wasn't that difficult either, but I did need to use pliers.  And, you have to get your bearings straight.  This is a different animal than your standard v-belt... I liken it to those link belts we all made at summer camp or in some craft class somewhere. Mine came with no intructions at all. 'A disappointment for sure, but I was able to download them.\n\nMy other complaint is that the directional arrows printed on the links are very hard to see.  A \"Sharpie\" helped out a lot. Anyway, after some trial and error I was able to size the belt correctly and install it.  As others have said, my saw will EASILY pass the nickel test, and my neighbor can't figure out why my cheap Jet runs so much smoother than his much more expensive Delta.  Don't worry,  he's a Buddy and I'll clue him in soon enough.  But for now, I just want to enjoy his frustration and confusion. I know, I'm bad, but it feels so good to know that just 30 bucks can make such a difference!!\n\nIf they offered these in the narrower, \"O/3L\" cross section, I would have one on my cheapy, Made in China drill press too. Don't judge me too harshly about this one. I'm on a budget!! (edit: They do!!  After much time spent researching I found out from the manufacturer, Fenner Drives that McMaster Carr carries them, though the price a bit higher than Amazon, but worth it.)\n\nAs I said in another review (of my saw) Don't ASK, just BUY ONE!! You WON'T be sorry... unless of course you put in on backward or something dumb like that.  It IS a \"directional\" belt.\n\nAs usual, I hope you find this review helpful, and Good Luck with your own dreams.", "label": 1}

I like the fact that it's 2 hour, since you can have faster results.\n\nOne of the reasons I'm docking stars is that this product has gotten more and more ridiculous to use over the years.

{"text": "I bought 4 of these cans in March 2007.  They are so bad, I have to throw them away and buy something that works.\n\nThe problem with these cans is with the plastic funnel.  First it's very difficult to install because the clearance between the spring loaded cap and the funnel is too small to allow the funnel to fit.  And it's so fat, that you can't empty more than about 1/3 the can into a vehicle's gas tank.  The funnel doesn't fit very well, so it ends up leaking gas on the floor under the can, and getting it all over you in the process.  The only way to get gas into a vehicle is to buy a gooseneck funnel to stick in the filler pipe, and then pour the gas from these horribly designed cans into the funnel.\n\nWe're so stupid now, that we can't even design a gas can that works.  This so called \"certified safety can\" leaks gas all over the area where it's being used, and takes two people to use.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!", "label": 0}

{"text": "I have a dryer vent on the third floor of my home whose exit through the wall to the exterior clapboards is surrounded by a bird-proof plastic \"cage\" that keeps the birds out but also keeps a lot of the lint inside the cage. If the cage isn't cleaned often, lint backs up into the dryer hose, making it both less efficient and ultimately increasing the risk of a dryer fire. Until now, that meant handing whoever was doing some other kind of work on the house (cleaning gutters, repairs, window washing, painting, etc.) with a long enough ladder a twenty and asking them to remove the cage, clean it out, and reattach it to the siding.\n\nWith these extenders, I can now reach it from a balcony one flight below the vent, using my shop vac to remove not only the lint caught in the cage, but also pulling more out of the dryer hose inside the wall itself because the suction of the shop vac is quite powerful. This keeps the dryer working at maximal efficiency and reduces the fire risk while saving money, allowing me to clean it from the outside whenever it's convenient to do so, and reducing the number of times I have to pull the dryer (it's a stacked unit, and the two appliances, the dryer atop the washer, are both heavy and difficult to maneuver as I get older) away from the wall to clean behind both and replace the dryer vent hose because it's become clogged with lint.\n\nThe only minor problem I find is that it just reaches the exterior vent cage and another set, even if I only use one of the two extensions, will allow me more flexibility when cleaning out the vent. I'll order them in the spring when the weather is better as it only needs to be done every four months or so to keep the vent exit reasonably clean and free from lint.", "label": 1}

After TWO days of drying (and scraping a lot of foaming residue) I dumped a load of dirt and it immediately split on first load.  Okay, maybe not enough surface area to make a good bond.  I took a strip of flexible plastic and roughed up both original surfaces and the new reinforcement strip and surface that would be in contact with it with 80 grit sandpaper, AND I also CLAMPED the reinforcement strip firmly, but not tightly, in 3 locations.  Again, after 3 or 4 days (home owner, don't have to use wheel barrow every day luckily) of setting time I went to use wheelbarrow.  Put shovel in wheelbarrow and let handle drop to side.  Guess what?  Yup, you guessed it, crack split again faster than cheerleaders doing splits at end of their routine!  So much for strong.\n\n* It has become brittle on two or three projects for me, mostly ones exposed to intense sunlight or freezing temperatures. And then FAILED.\n\nAs to water proof & requires no mixing, I guess these are correct, but so are almost all other resin and polyurethane adhesives; environmentally friendly -- what about it is enviro friendly?  More hype to get tree huggers and green freaks to buy a product I suppose.\n\n* * Plus this stuff foams up worse than a dog that has just tried to eat a toad and is very messy to clean up and it surface even when capped tightly in bottle tends to become rock hard and requires coat hanger to break up to get to adhesive.\n\nI have relegated what I have left to NON critical small insignificant wood/paper bonding and will NOT be purchasing again.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I bought this vacuum cleaner for because I am a fan of the power, simplicity (and aesthetics) of the traditional F&G style vacuum cleaners. For this particular product, I would say you get what you pay for, but almost not even that.\n* Note: The vacuum pictured is not the Eureka 1934B. The Eureka 1934B is different in that the bag and hood are both solid Grey, and instead of the Eureka logo being on the bag, \"TheBoss\" logo is on the bag.\n\nThe Eureka is lightweight @10.4 pounds, it has a rather short 20' power cord, a 5 amp motor, and nearly all plastic construction. It comes with one 11 quart dust bag and an extra belt. It has a 12\" wooden brush-roll with one line of bristles and a plastic agitator and 6 height settings.\n\nPros:\n It's quiet, operating at ~89db\n Effective against pet hair\n Lightweight at 10.4 pounds\n Like most vacuums of this style, it pulls up the carpet, making it appear newer\n\nCons:\n The motor is rather weak\n The power cord is only 20', which may seem like a lot, until you realize you can't plug it in in one room and reach the next.\n The construction is all plastic, with the exception of the fan chamber cover and the springs/screws used to hold the vacuum together.\n The metal bottom plate seems to be sized slightly wrong; will be explained later.\n The actual vacuum is not as displayed. This vacuum is the 1934B, the one displayed is the original 1934. [...]\n The filtration is bar none; only the bag filters\n\nThe main problem I have with this vacuum is the 5 amp motor. If you have an already relatively clean and small house, with only light things, such as dust, hair, paper, and light plastic to pick up, then this vacuum will do well for you. If you vacuum anything more than that, this vacuum is not. I tested this vacuum cleaner on the house I just moved out of. After all my furniture was moved, things on the floor lingered like small splinters of wood, tiny nails, small pieces of plastic, staples and other dense but not unreasonable things like that. This vacuum could not handle them. It wasn't that it was going to break the machine, but it all rattled around in the chamber for minutes until I turned off the vacuum and fished them out. The suction from the 5 amp motor was not powerful enough to suck them into the fan chamber *or* to propel them into the dust bag.\n\nAs far as the metal plate on the bottom, all vacuums have a plate in front of the brush-roll that keeps the brush-roll in place. As it curves in under the vacuum, a lot of dirt collects there. This means that when the vacuum is tilted, or when the plate is taken off, all the dirt falls out.\n\nFor my own uses, I am in need of something heavier and more powerful. I feel that this vacuum will not last me very long. I would suggest spending the extra 100 dollars and just buying the Sanitaire SC886, which comes with a 7 amp motor, a 50' power cord, and nearly all metal construction.\n\nIf you need a vacuum for light use and pick up, I would suggest this one.", "label": 0}

When I actually starting using the brush, I found that it wasn't very effective at cleaning my teeth, at least not as effective as it could have been.

I put the belt on the motor pully first then around the brush and insert the left side in the slot and then the right side slides into the slot easily.  The belt is a tight fit.  Eureka should include a small tool, pry bar, to stretch the belt over the motor pulley.\n\nUpdate 3/17/2016\nI changed the belt today and it was nearly imposable to get the new belt on.  You have to remove the brush to get the old belt off and the new belt on.  It took me a half hour to get the brush to slide back into the groove even without the belt on it.  The brush has rubber grommets on each end and they just don't slide into the groove in the housing.\nUpdate 4/21/2016\nToday the brush froze up and wouldn't turn causing the vacuum to be useless..

{"text": "This type of Gorilla Glue is a reasonable glue for crude jobs where you wish to fill small cracks.  It is not a good glue for situations  you want to sand over wide cracks to get a smooth surface.\n\nGorilla Glue 50008 is a urethane glue, so it resembles honey.  It is sticky and messy.  The cap on this particular product can be conveniently left attached to the bottle by a plastic strip so you won't loose it,  but if you leave it attached  you'll find the cap inconveniently springing back in front of the spout as you are squeezing out glue.\n\nThe fact that urethane glue is messy  is significant because it sticks well to skin and won't completely wash off even before it hardens.  On your skin it quickly picks up dirt and becomes a dark crusty patch.  You end up with hands that look lilke a mechanic's but you can't wash them like a mechanic - not with  Lava Soap, mechanic's hand cleaner, acetone, or  brake fluid cleaner.  Gorilla glue has never irritated my skin.  It's just a cosmetic problem.  You have to let it wear off, which takes about 4 days.  There is no practical way to clean Gorilla Glue out of fabrics.  If you want to keep your hands clean, put lotion on them and use rubber gloves.  Expect drips of glue to fall on the work table and on the floor and remain sticky for hours.\n\nLike honey, Gorilla glue becomes viscous in cold weather.  When the glue gets cold,  seconds tick by before you can begin to squeeze glue out of a half empty bottle because you must wait for it to flow down to the spout.  So it's best to store the glue indoors.\n\nWith its cap on, Gorilla Glue stores well for months.  Getting the cap off may require a gentle twist with pliers, but the spout and cap are a durable plastic and they can take it.  The dried sheet of glue on them comes off cleanly.  (For this reason, I don't recommend trying to glue such plastic with Gorilla glue.)\n\nThe scenario for a good glue job with an old fashioned hide glues is well known.  The things to be glued are supposed to fit together \"naturally\" and tightly.  There aren't supposed to be cracks.  The pieces should have \"clean dry\" surfaces.  You apply glue to both surfaces.  You spread the glue out o a even film on both surfaces, not simply squirt a squiggly bead of glue.  The surfaces are clamped together with the \"appropriate pressure\".  This means they aren't clamped so tightly that it builds up stresses that will spring apart when the clamps are released.  You can wipe excess old fashioned glue off when it is wet.  Some say it is easier to wait until the glue is leathery but not hard and peel it off with a chisel.\n\nSome of the old fashioned scenario doesn't apply to urethane glue.  It's best that pieces  fit together naturally and tightly.  Gorilla glue tolerates moisture and, in fact, the directions say that the surfaces should not be too dry.  Ideally one would spread the glue evenly on the surfaces, but this is a messy job.  Since Gorilla glue foams as it dries, it somewhat spreads itself out.  It doesn't spread to a miraculous extent.  If you pull apart surfaces that were glued with squiggly beads of glue, you will find patches that are bare.\n\nAfter you clamp pieces together you can wipe off excess Gorilla glue and this somewhat helps in the final cleanup.  However, more glue will ooze out as you wait for the glue to harden and that  takes overnight.\n\nAs well as flowing for a long time, urethane glues foam.  Gorilla glue foams slightly more than Elmer's \"Ultimate\" urethane glue.  (Urethane glues don't foam to the extent of urethane foam sealants that you buy in spray cans.)  You have to clamp things together securely or the foaming action will push them apart.\n\nYou cannot wait till Gorilla Glue is leathery hard and peel the excess off because after a blob gets a hard surface the inside remains tacky for a long time.\n\nThe hardened foam of excess glue is dense.  It's tougher than styrofoam.  A belt sander makes quick work of sanding it off if you sand it all off. (If you only sand the top off the foam, you'll just expose the insides of thousands of glue bubbles.)  In places you can't reach with a sander, excess glue can be chiseled off., but it leaves a fuzzy reside that must be sanded off by hand.  You can leave the excess glue if you aren't concerned  about appearance, but direct sunlight darkens it  and makes it deteriorate.\n\nI often use Gorilla in simple carpentry projects that are held together with both screws and glue.  I trust the screws to hold things together.  The Gorilla Glue mainly serves the purpose of filling the gaps in joints that are too small to fill with wood filler.

{"text": "Review updated 9Aug12\n\n1) Elmers \"Ultimate High Performance\" is also a Polyurethane (PU) glue and (as far as I can tell) it's as good as Gorilla, but cheaper. also used the PL brand glue and can't tell any notable difference between the three. Have not used Sumo but I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #3)\n\n2) Gorilla Glue (In my opinion) has thought out their bottle and cap design better than the competition.  While this seems like a minor thing, it really makes a BIG difference in not being messy or wasting glue (See #4)\n\n3) PU glues work differently - they foam up and expand in the presence of moisture and then harden.  This means you will need to think about where the glue comes out and how to keep it from making a mess.  Masking tape is your friend.\n\n4) PU glues have a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. Due to the expansion (see #3) you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be MORE than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle. I personally buy the 2 oz bottle unless I have a major project.  PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.\n\n5) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking (see #7). They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.\n\n6) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! Although the glue itself is not toxic and is food safe once cured, it can kill your pets - like antifreeze it apparently tastes good to animals and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google \"Dog Gorilla Glue.\" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper and paper towels.\n\n7) Wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding.  Fine Woodworking did a test (Issue #192) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong in this application.  Search \"HowStrongisYourGlue_FWW\" for the article.  One exception is if you're gluing oily exotics where I personally still prefer Epoxy - you can dial in your set time, clean up is about the same given the PU glue outflow.\n\n[...]", "label": 2}

In addition to installing a real fence system (as opposed to that which came with the saw) I upgraded the motor to 2hp.\nAfter putting the motor on and running it, it cut much better, but there was still a good bit of noise and vibration. Going a step further, I replaced the cheap cast pulleys with machined, cast iron pulleys and installed the Power Twist v-belt. What a world of difference!

There are two sizes listed with each roll of tape!  I didn't read the second measurement which was 3/16 X 3/8 inch by 17 feet!!  Why this is different on the second explanation I do not know.  I just was excited about the measurements and bought it.  I couldn't wait until it arrived to start working on my display case!  Well, it came in two days and WoW!, was I surprised.  It was not thick enough!  It was the right width but way too thin for a dust barrier!!  I called Amazon and got a really nice guy on the line and he read the same thing I did!!!  Anyway, I ended up ordering another two rolls so I could double the thickness of the barrier for the dust!  Double work, but Amazon was great!  If you buy this product be sure you read all the way down and read both measurements.  It will save you a lot of time and disappointment with the product.  If it had been the thickness I wanted I would have rated it a 5 Star, but the measurements made me rate it lower.

{"text": "I was excited to get these for an upholstery project I am working on and have not been able to find any 22 gauge staples locally.  I dropped them into my stapler, which is supposed to accept 3/8 inch crown staples and I couldn't close the slide.  I thought something was wrong with my stapler, until I dropped some T50's in (with a lower gauge) and was able to close the slide.  I got out a ruler and sure enough, the T50's had a crown that was exactly 3/8 inch, but these had a 5/16 crown, meaning they were too narrow.  The box said 3/8 inch crown so I didn't know if the box was just filled with the wrong staples, since there did appear to be about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room in the box, or if it was just a manufacturing defect and they were made too narrow.  Regardless, they were unusable in my stapler.  Also, the legs were not 1/2 inch as stated, they were also short by 1/16th of an inch.  The leg length did not really pose a problem for me like the crown width did.\n\nAmazon was great, and refunded my money right away. I also contacted the company and they were friendly and very quick to respond to my concerns.  Their response follows -\n\n\"First and foremost, thank you very much for your e-mail.  Would you mind telling me what the model number of your tool is?  I ask because there are different styles of fine wire fasteners that are all called a 3/8\" crown but they are made from different gauge wire and are not interchangeable in the same tools.  While these 71/12 staples are called a 3/8\" crown, the production tolerance actually has them run narrower to fit in that tool series.  It may seem misleading but the reason that this style staple is called a 3/8\" is because all of the tool manufacturers call that style tool a 3/8\" crown stapler.\"\n\nOverall, if you order be sure to check the measurements of the staples you receive if you can't get them to work in your stapler.  For reference I purchased the Freeman Fine Wire Stapler. I almost returned the stapler thinking that it was defective, because I had a hard time believing the staples were my problem.  Now I'm back on the hunt again for 22 gauge staples that will work and have truly a 3/8 inch crown.", "label": 2}

{"text": "This thing works great. I used it to single-handedly raise 13' high x 16' long 2x4 (16\" c/c spacing) walls of an RV garage. I used only one jack. You just need to find balance point of wall and it works fine, but I wouldn't go any longer than 16'. I also did not sheath the walls, although they had three rows of blocking and some had headers and the extra framing for that.\n\nThe instructions tell you the min length needed for your 2x4 that the jack climbs, per your wall ht. but it says that taller than 10' is not recommended. It states that 10' requires a 16' 2x4, which I didn't believe until I did my geometry! It's true. For the 13' high walls I needed a 20' 2x4, the longest my lumber yard has. I found all of this out after the fact and got lucky that I could even use the jack for my application at all.\n\nYou need to be able to support a block right behind the jack pole (the 2x4) at just about 3\" or so beyond where the top of the wall reaches on the floor. The pole is standing straight up at this point, with the wall slightly raised. I had raised mine by hand enough to slide a chunk of 2x10 under. You might be able to get by with a little less. Attaching that block would be pretty easy on a wood floor of course but I have concrete and had to devise something different. It was time-consuming but there's no room for error.\n\nI would say you can get by without the wind kit but I did try to order that. Couldn't get it for some reason. I wound up tying the jack to the wall to retain it at its peak but of course you need to retain the bottom as well, which isn't as easy since it leans more and more as you go. Best method I settled on was to tie the jack to wall and jack it to pretty near vertical and then use another block of wood and screws to retain bottom of 2x4 (on top side) from wanting to move forward without permission. I attached the retaining block too early on the first wall, which was only 12' long because I wanted to try the shorter wall first (2nd and 3rd pics). You can see that the 2x4 was pretty bowed and that was all because of the block I attached too soon and on bottom side of 2x4 pole. I later attached it to the top side of pole and when there was very little more jacking needed. Otherwise it will be really straight all the way up, with no bowing. If you do all of that right you basically have it braced in the middle for the time you have the jack attached. I still wouldn't do it in a wind though.\n\nI also used it to raise 15' long 9-1/2\" LVL's one-at-a-time straight up to the 11' required ht. I goofed up on the first one and got in a bind. Just keep in mind the space it needs as it rises. You don't want to get way up there and have a problem because you can't just crank this down like a pump jack. It's basically one-way when it's got weight on it.\n\nAnother poster said it's easier to take jack down after you're done and then pump it the rest of the way off the end, take back to the bottom, and remount than it is to try to lower it back down. Very true, especially when she's 20' long!\n\nYou'll need a piece of 3/4\" or 1\" pipe but it doesn't need to be any longer than about 2' and could be shorter too.\n\nGood luck and be careful!

Very few carry over 2 3/8\" in a ring shank, and those that do charge about $30 or more to ship.

The coating is very thick and not uniform; so the \"ring\" portion is a hit or miss affair, leaving some nails looking as though they had virtually no rings at all. Some of the nails were also slightly bent; not an issue when using a hammer, but hopefully it won't jam my nailer.\nI test shot a strip, shooting a short piece of Timberstrand dimensional lumber into another piece of Timberstrand (I rarely use pine 2 by's). Nailing into Timberstrand requires more nailer power which my NR90 had no problem with.\nOn the plus side, the nailer worked fine and the board was extremely difficult to dislodge from the other board using three of these nails; so I think they'll work for my purposes.\nFor a comparision between these nails and my Hitachi ring shank nails; see the above photo.", "label": 0}

Have not used Sumo and from what I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #2)\n\n2) This has a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. PU glue foams up and you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be more than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle - I can't even imagine buying the 16 oz bottle. PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.\n\n3) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking. They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.\n\n4) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! PU glue is waterproof and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google \"Dog Gorilla Glue\" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper.\n\n5) Aliphatic wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding.

{"text": "This is a review of the Rembrandt Deeply White Whitening Mouthwash with Fluoride Fresh Mint, 16 Ounce. There seems to be a few different products under this listing. This mouthwash is designed to freshen breath but also to whiten teeth by removing surface stains. You use it after brushing your teeth and let it foam up in your mouth. You shouldn't drink or eat anything for 30 minutes after you use it to let the peroxide, which is the main whitening ingredient, do its thing.\n\nThis mouthwash can burn if you have cold sores, small scrapes or cuts, or any sort of invitation in your mouth or on your gums. That is due to the peroxide and is normal but not very pleasant. My teeth feel foamy and clean when I use this but I don't see a ton of whitening. It takes 12 weeks of using it twice a day for results according to he packaging. I do think it helps with stains but it's pricier than very similar mouthwashes. I bought some Listerine after brushing whitening mouthwash at the dollar store and it has just about the exact same ingredients and works better. I generally love Rembrandt's products and this mouth wash IS decent but I feel I get too little results for too many dollars. Still, if you are  Rembrandt loyalist, this is a good mouthwash to use after brushing to help your teeth to stay white  or get a bit whiter.", "label": 2}

I also use large headed pan head screws to hold the bracket to the soffit.  Although an \"adjustable brace\" would suit the other readers here, there's a reason why its non-adjustable and it has to do with OSHA regs. The maximum distance the staging plank can be from the vertical working area is 14 inches; the span of two eight inch wide staging planks is 16 inches, so there is your 30 inches. One reader wanted to have the vertical pole 36 inches out. Hey, you can design your scaffolding project the way you want, but you really should keep within the OSHA guidelines. There is a reason why they exist: they're tried and trued safety guidelines. If you happen to fall I would bet your homeowner's insurance may very well be denied because you did not follow the government guidelines.

{"text": "There are two major flaws in the design of the brush which makes this great brush not worth the money compared to its competitors.  First major one is the battery door.  This brush requires you to grip the small door and the body of the brush and pull apart slowly.  Over time the build up on the door makes it more and more difficult to get it apart and can lead to instances where the batteries are whipped out.  In addition, the rubber seal on the door deteorates and rips over time, allowing water into the battery terminal.  Once it gets wet, this reusable brush is not usable anymore.\n\nSecondly, the head screws on and off.  While this may seem idea, you have to torque against the smooth plastic to get it going.  My brush heads always looks like a comb-over by the time I finish struggling with it.\n\nOther than that, it is a great brush.  However, these two flaws makes it a deal breaker for me.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I bought 2 of the 8 inch vices for a workbench I built from recycled materials.  My project goal was to build a sturdy bench for $100 or less, which I accomplished.\n\nThe vices are OK for the price I paid, but they do have some issues.  First the the mounting bracket is not machined square to the face jaws.  So when you mount the vice it looks good but the vice holds a piece of wood out of plumb with the bench.  Why is this a problem?  When using a hand plane you will plane a board out of square if the piece is not level with the bench your are using.  This happens because you will instinctively level a board to the horizontal plane of the bench.  I fixed this problem by using shims under the mounting brackets.  Now all boards held in the vice are plumb with the bench surface.\n\nThe second issue is the machining of the vice ball screw.  The tolerances are a bit sloppy and because of this when clamping a board you can see the mouth (top part of the vice) doesn't close as tightly as the bottom (next to the ball screw.)  This can be fixed by planing your wood inserts on a slight bevel make the inserts slightly thicker on top than the bottom.  That way, when you apply pressure, the jaws will move but will now hold the board securely because the both faces of the jaws will be parallel.\n\nIn spite of these issues, the vices give you a lot of value for the money.  Most wood workers can use them for holding material for sawing, drilling, etc. without any problems.  That said, if you use hand tools like planes to true up your boards, take the time to adjust the vice as I mentioned above.  The vices are sturdy and I expect to get years of service from them.", "label": 2}

Turned it on and started cleaning up, and when time to turn it off the switch would not work! try and try and the thing would not turn off. So I unplugged it from the wall. The reason this is a big deal is when someone pays close to 100 dollars for a product it should last more than six months, and the other reason is when I plug it back in or unplug it there are sparks at least half inch long coming from the outlet. This not only will hurt someone, but will make the outlet in the house no good either. As far as care goes it is well maintained. Bag change and belt (which it doesn't need one because it never worked long enough). Is this worth 90 dollars, NO. If you take the top off to look at the motor and power switch its held together by cardboard. And the switch is cheap plastic so no wonder why it quit working. Checked to see if there is a replacement switch, and guess what, Eureka has discontinued the belts and Bags, and no power switch.  So to bring this to a end, the 20ft power cord is short, the bag beings to smell after while, all plastic, switch fails, all this thing has for it is power.

The bristles are great for \"scrubbing\" things that won't simply get clean by running the other vacuum attachments over it. I used it clean my wool coats and my hats, like a much more efficient clothes brush. The dust came off immediately. It even got dog hair off my clothes, which can usually only be done with those sticky tape rollers. I used it to scrub the built up dust off my bubble ceiling around the vents. It was rough enough to detach the dust but not so rough that it damaged the bubbles. Now the ceiling around my vents are white again. I used it to scrub the built up dust off my baseboards and around my windows.\n\nSince using mine to help clean my bathroom, I want another one to use exclusively as a clothes brush. I think one for cleaning dirt and dust and another one for clothes and hats are enough at once.\n\nI don't agree with the review that stated that the bristles ought to be shorter. If he wants them to be shorter, he can always use a pair of scissors and cut them shorter. It's not that hard to do. For me, if the bristles were shorter then they would be rougher, and I don't think it would work as well for what I used it for. As I said before, it worked very well for all the tasks I put it to, so I'm satisfied with it as it is. Yes, with enough use, the bristles could come loose, but that is to be expected. It happens with any brush.\n\nEDIT: I went to the hardware store and almost bought the other brand's dusting brush, but I couldn't find one in the bin worth buying. Most of them were so shoddily made that the bristles didn't meet in the back, so there was a huge gap, and it looked as though it could fall apart. Who knew there would be such a big difference in quality for such a simple thing? This is definitely the better vacuum dusting brush.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Review updated 9Aug12\n\n1) Elmers \"Ultimate High Performance\" and \"Sticky Ass\" are also Polyurethane (PU) glues and (as far as I can tell) they're as good as Gorilla but less expensive. I have also used PL brand and can't tell any notable difference between the four. Have not used Sumo but I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #3)\n\n2) Gorilla Glue (In my opinion) has thought out their bottle and cap design better than the competition.  While this seems like a minor thing, it really makes a BIG difference in not being messy or wasting glue (See #4)\n\n3) PU glues work differently - they foam up and expand in the presence of moisture and then harden.  This means you will need to think about where the glue comes out and how to keep it from making a mess.  Masking tape is your friend.\n\n4) PU glues have a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. Due to the expansion (see #3) you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be MORE than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle. I personally buy the 2 oz bottle unless I have a major project.  PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.\n\n5) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking (see #7). They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.\n\n6) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! Although the glue itself is not toxic and is food safe once cured, it can kill your pets - like antifreeze it apparently tastes good to animals and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google \"Dog Gorilla Glue.\" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper and paper towels.\n\n7) Wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding.  Fine Woodworking did a test (Issue #192) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong in this application.  Search \"HowStrongisYourGlue_FWW\" for the article.  One exception is if you're gluing oily exotics where I still prefer Epoxy - you can dial in your set time, clean up is about the same given the PU glue outflow.\n\nIf you have questions or comments, or if you have found this review helpful, please let me know!", "label": 2}

{"text": "This was my first steam cleaner.  I really like the idea behind it and it *does* work.  It does not do all the work for you but it helps a great deal!  I learned one thing, in the shower when cleaning you have to steam and quickly wipe away the dirt, soap scum, whatever it is you are removing from your shower wall.  If you steam a very large area and wait too long to wipe it clean it almost bakes in the soap residue.  If you steam a small area and then wipe it away it works quite well.\nI bought this product and then I read reviews.  I think I would not have purchased this model had I read reviews first.  Actually, there are *so* many reviews referring to something that breaks and causes burns I went ahead and returned the product.  After looking it over carefully and considering the temperature of the water after it's heated (boiling) I decided it was too great of a risk to take.  It is not made well.  There are too many parts that will break probably sooner than later.  I only cleaned my shower but due to the concerns I had after really examining this product I decided it was too great of a risk and returned it.\nHowever I really like the concept of steam cleaning.  No harsh chemicals, it kills bacteria, it does get rid of soap scum, it works.  I am currently looking for a bigger boiler, something that will hold more water because *this* product lasts about 15 minutes max and you have to let it cool down, refill it, wait for it to boil, then you get another (up to) 15 minutes.\nOverall, it does the job but the risk is just too great and the time needed for 15 minutes of cleaning just isn't worth it.

I took it apart, cleaning and looking for obstructions, finding none.  With recovery tank removed, the suction is powerful coming directly from vacuum engine port.  Once recovery tank was replaced, all gaskets inspected, nozzle cleaned and lid on securely, there was still scant suction.  This is a design problem that needs to be fixed.  Thank goodness I bought from COSTCO with the always return policy with a full refund.  I'll try a different model or manufacturer for this as next step.

Bought four of these pump jack systems - set three up and needed two more braces.\n\nI read the reviews before deciding to purchase and saw most of the not-so-good marks related to the 30\" span the brace will provide.  I have no issue with this span.\n\nConcerning the brace, it works as advertised.  However, here are some of the issues I encountered:\n- the metal plates that surround the double 2x4 don't fit exactly.  They are about 1/8 not wide enough.  Luckily the enclosed carriage bolt was long enough to allow me to attach them.\n- had to use a wire brush wheel on the carriage bolt to get the paint off of them.  Would like to see stainless steel provided by the manufacturer and not painted steel.  I will replace mine with SS soon.  Luckily, I have a bench grinder/wheel and removing the paint wasn't difficult.\n- not fond of the 32\" span.  My old house (100+ years) was buitl with 24\" centers (I didn't know they did that yars ago until I tore my house apart).  This was easily resolved by attaching an old 1/4 (7/8 thick) to the 2x4's and then attaching the brace to this, putting a 2x4 block behind the brace for additional screw support.\n- not fond of having a wing nut to hold the carriage bolt.  Doesn't seem like it would be substantial enough, but it is.  I'll replace it with a regular hex nut (with washer and star lock washer) when I change the carriage bolt to stainless.\n- I understand why the supports that attach to the house are vertical, but that didn't do me much good since I wasn't attaching directly to studs.  Easy to work around, however.\n\nMy double 2x4 columns are 24' long - I have the top brace 2\" down from the top because I need to pump the system to the top.  I should have went with 30' columns, but I didn't know this until the 1st column was put into place.  If you run columns this long, plan for two braces unless you feel comfortable with swaying.  I am able to park the system above the lower brace (which are positoned about 8' from the ground) and reach the scaffold via a deck that's next to my work area.\n\nNO CORNER BRACES EXIST!  I searched high and low and cannot find a corner brace - one that will allow me to walk around a corner via a scaffold resting on top of another scaffold.  Simple to design, however, and I will have mine created by a fabrication shop this winter before I set up to put vinyl siding on my house.\n\nOverall, the braces work as advertised and I'd buy them again.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have gone through quite a few tubes for sealing exterior siding and caulking around window and door trim after replacing a lot of windows and 3 exterior doors.\n\nIt goes on easily and fills cracks well because is not too \"stiff\".  However, when the pressure is released, the caulk continues to slowly keep coming out. With a narrow bead, about 3/32\", it can ooze out up to eight inches.  When I stop to reposition the caulk gun, it oozes enough that I have to wipe off the spout because there is too much to caulk accumulated on it to make a clean transition when resuming caulking.\n\nI suspect the continued oozing is a packaging problem such that the pressure is not fully relieved when the caulk gun ram mechanism is completely released.  This makes the job much messier than it should.\n\nI have used both white and almond and they behave the same way.  It sets up fairly quickly, like latex paint, but does remain flexible.\n\nIf you have small defects, such as a depression around a nail head, you can just get some caulk on your finger and smear it over the defect.  It seals it quite well and while leaving a slight depression, it seals much better than filler.\n\nIt does store well.  I just put an electrical wire nut over the spout and screw it on.\n\nIf you have gaps greater than 1/8\", use a backing filler and plan on making a couple of passes with several hours between them.  It is not stiff enough to fill larger gaps.  Don't expect to be able to fill larger gaps so that they are flush - expect a slight depression at the gap.\n\nI have had some exposed to weather for several months without any apparent degradation - it will be painted eventually.\n\nIf it had better workability, I would give it 5 stars.

The directions are very specific about how and where to apply the gel and I followed those exactly. When the tray pressed up against my teeth I'm guessing it pressed a little bit of the whitener up towards my gum-line. I experienced a small tingling sensation, but it wasn't something that bothered me to the point that I had to take the trays out.\n\nSeveral hours after using the trays I ate dinner and my bottom gums felt like they were covered in canker sores. When I went to go brush my teeth I noticed a white film around my gum line - it wasn't leftover whitening, as I had made sure to scrub it all off. The white film was skin that was peeling off of my gums and leaving red raw patches.\nI knew that the product said to try not to have your gums, tongue, or lips come into contact with the whitener, but I have never seen or had such a reaction to a whitener (I've tried several of Crest's and Listerine's whitening products).\n\nOn the plus side, my teeth are certainly a few shades whiter, so I have no doubt that they work!

On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape.

Cleaning up the joint takes time and many time ruined the molding.  The only glue that worked for me was the jell, the others never held and ran out of the joint making a mess.

{"text": "The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.\nUnfortunately I could not find a better quality 2\" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Works as advertised, but there are a couple of shortcomings which are related and may not affect many people.\nFirst, the span between the attachment points is 32\" based on the assumption that they will be used with 16\" stud spacing.  Since I was working high on the gable end of my house, I was attaching to the end roof truss which has 24\" spacing between verticals.  My solution was to make an adapter out of a 2x4 which would fit between the brace and the house.\nSecond, the two mounting holes at each attachment point are 3\" apart which means they can't both be used to attach to a horizontal 2x4 (ie: the adapter mentioned above).  I had to drill an aditional hole between the two existing holes on the brace so I could mount each side with two screws.\nSince I pre-drilled the holes on the side of the house, I was able to mount them by myself with no problem.  I was able to hold the brace with one hand and insert the screw with the other while standing on a ladder.  They're not very heavy and since the attachment points swivel, the braces hang down while you're attaching them.  The only part of the job I found intimidating was handling the heavy poles (22 feet long in my case) while standing way up there.\nIt turned out that the 30\" length was fine for my particular job, but they would certainly be more versatile if they were adjustable as mentioned by the other reviewers.", "label": 1}

I had 8 holes I needed to drill out to ~1\" to accommodate a 1/2\" stainless female coupler. I did my best to keep the RPMs and feed rate down as to not work harden the stainless but despite my best efforts, the bit really struggled from 3/4\" on. Part of the problem was maintaining the proper speed and feed with a hand drill but part of the problem was the burr formation on the bit as I used it. This started to happen around hole 5 and was somewhat surprising considering the hardness and price of this bit. Once the burrs formed, hence dulling and generating heat, my speed was no longer the problem due to the bit's inability to cut. The bit really struggled to make the 1\" hole even when new but cut very easily through the stainless for smaller holes.  Perhaps a large drill press would do the trick but this was not practical for my use. If using this bit with stainless, watch your speed and feed and keep it cool as possible and stick to smaller holes. My bit will never cut another hole above 3/4\" which is very disappointing considering the price I paid for it.", "label": 2}

This sandpaper lasts considerably longer, is much, much stronger and you simply cut it to size, stick one layer on the pad of your sander as a base, then add another layer,  clip them in and away you go. Not only that, it makes your pads last 10X longer as well. When it's worn out, remove it (I find it helps to let a few layers of sandpaper build up on the pad). This will save you a fortune in throw away single sheets and OK, it doesn't have any holes in it so you won't be collecting much dust - but then do you really anyway? Saves time, works better and saves a fortune in the long run. Does a much better job too and if you ever need a small piece for hand sanding, simply cut a sheet to the desired size, fold it over and stick it to itself and again, it won't slip, you won't be tearing it or cursing at it, you'll be able to get into those tight corners and the job will be done so much better in half the time!

My eyes turn red and sometimes watery, my mouth is on fire, often times my stuffed nasal canals are gasping for air, struggling to inhale oxygen and this exacerbates the problem. So it does burn. Think Listerine. Some people have a higher tolerance, others don't. That's why I use ACT mouthwash as my primary mouthwash and use this to whiten my teeth. People commented about the foam, the foam doesn't bother me as much as those who've pointed it out. If you can withstand the burn, then you're more likely to follow through this regimen, if you can't withstand it, then you're more likely to become discouraged.

{"text": "We've used this glue for a variety of projects but to tell you the truth, it's really not one of our favorites.  We still use it occasionally but it's not our \"go to\" glue if you know what I mean.\n\nIf we're looking for a glue that will fill gaps we'll use.  Otherwise, we'll use something else.\n\nWhat I Like:\n-------------------------\n If you're not concerned about the appearance of the glue joint, it woks pretty well and it expands quite a bit so it can bridge gaps that other types of glues can't.  With other types of glue, if you use to much, it will skim over and only the surface will cure.  The glue that is under the skimmed over film won't usually set up.  This glue is moisture cured and doesn't have this problem.\n\nWhat I Don't Like:\n-------------------------\n It's very messy to work with and if you don't use gloves you're likely to get it on your fingers and it won't wash off with soap and water.\n If you get it anywhere other than the glue joint, post cure cleanup can be difficult.\n When it drys it expands a lot so there is often an extra clean up step once the glue is fully cured.  We often have to trim off any glue that expands out of the glue joint.\n As it cures and expands, the actual cured glue is quite porous.  By that I mean there will be several air bubbles in the cured glue.  At least we have found this to be the case with glue joints that aren't clamped tight during the curing process.", "label": 2}

Unfortunately, with Shop Vacs, you inevidibly, compromise power and performance when you go for the smaller models.\n\nWhat I like about this vacuum:\n\n1. Its lightweight-easy to carry around, especially when cleaning the car. I occasionally use it indoors as well.\n\n2. I've used it a few times. If you clean the filter (or whatever it is that they tell you to empty and clean after each use) as recommended then the vacuum maintains its \"full strength\" power (as time goes by, it does lose strength when you're using it, but thats due to its small \"holding\" capacity-it can't stomach 16 lbs. of debris).\n\n3. Price. Hey I paid ~$30, so I can't expect the performance of an industrial strength commercial cleaner or even my household canister that cost a few hundred bucks. But for the price, its a nice little tool for little jobs.\n\nWhat I don't like about it:\n\n1. It seems to blow a lot of dust around sometimes. But this may have more to do with how you hold it then the product itself. Because when I was cleaning my car, I'd notice sometimes an area that I had just cleaned would be dirty a few minutes later. And I think this was in part due to the how the vacuum was positioned because there is a part of it that vents out air which I think is responsible for blowing around debris and dirtying areas that had just been cleaned. So be mindful of how the vacuum is sitting or how you're holding it and you will be OK.\n\n2. Not a lot of power. But like I said-for $30, I didn't buy this with unrealistic expectations. In fact, I was more impressed with what I got for the price, then anything.\n\n3.

{"text": "Good:  Extremely strong bond.  Versatile over many types of surface applications. I glued the foam back together on a set of Oakley ski goggles two days ago.

Limited shelf life-squeeze the air out each time, and next time I'd probably buy the 4oz version  unless you're using it constantly, because it goes a long way.\n\nBad: Foams a lot for a glue, and has a tendency to squeeze out from tiny cracks under compression.  This means you have to sit and monitor it and wipe off the foam as it comes out.  Silly boy you say, just use less glue....I did!  I had about twenty feet of a finished wood extender to put on our new kitchen cabinets to we could get the crown molding to fit.  By the end, I'd learned to put the glue on towards the back of the piece so it didn't squish out the front, and was using a very thin bead as well.\n\nBottom Line:  If I had two pieces of something to glue together and didn't worry about seeing some glue lines, I'd reach for this.  If I had something I planned on showing a finished face on, I'd use regular wood glue.  Depending on the strength I needed, I might use this, but I'd be very, very careful, otherwise you could wind up with a hard foamy mess on a finished surface.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First: I wanted to like this mouthwash.\n\nMy background: I brush and floss twice a day. I use the Rembrandt Deeply White fresh mint toothpaste and have been using it for the past few years with no problems (see my separate review for the Rembrandt winter mint toothpaste). I do love the Rembrandt toothpaste, it whitens and also does fight cavities, in fact I've only been to the dentist in the past few years due to routine cleaning, nothing more. Needless to say, I had high hopes for the mouthwash.\n\nWhat I expected: I wanted my teeth to be whitened a bit more, mostly. The fresh breath wasn't a big deal, but would be nice. I also liked how there was fluoride in the mouthwash which was claimed to \"strengthen enamel.\"\n\nWhat happened: Yes, it works for whitening teeth. I noticed a difference within a few days. It was pretty impressive. However, due to how my teeth were already quite white, the difference wasn't anything spectacular. Just a nice shade whiter. Those with more yellow teeth, as is the case with most whitening products, are likely to see bigger results. The mouthwash also helps keep my teeth smooth. Freshening my breath? Ehh...it does but really not extremely so. In fact, I'd say that Listerine would probably do a better job if you just wanted fresh breath. It didn't make my teeth sensitive, either. But for strengthening enamel? On to that...\n\nThe ugly: After using the mouthwash for about a month and a half (used it twice a day, two capfuls as prescribed on the label for 1min. exactly), I had two bad experiences. First, when biting down on a somewhat tough bagel, my front tooth came down and chipped off a small piece of one of my bottom teeth. Second, while eating a strawberry, one of the seeds got stuck between my two front teeth where some cosmetic work had been done...it cracked one of my teeth! Not to the point where it caused pain, but there's a crack on the inside and it's now very difficult to floss between my two front teeth. It may be a result of using the Rembrandt toothpaste with the mouthwash and having too much peroxide overall, but the routine made my teeth very brittle. Moreover, Rembrandt does recommend using their own Deeply White toothpaste in tandem with this mouthwash. Funny enough, I was particularly keen to try this mouthwash as there is no alcohol in it, but it seems to have not mattered much. I have no idea how much peroxide is actually in this stuff, perhaps it's too much. So I ended up with a chipped tooth and a cracked tooth within a week of each other. That's when I stopped using the mouthwash. Keep in mind I've never chipped or cracked a tooth before this.\n\nAfterthoughts: My teeth were already quite white to begin with and I just wanted to get them a bit nicer. Yes, the product made them a bit whiter. But it also made my teeth more brittle. I do bleach my teeth using professional grade gel, but that is once every half a year, and the last time I bleached was months ago, so I doubt that had much to do with it.\n\nThe price: isn't killer, just $5 a bottle here on amazon and free super saver shipping. Considering the damage it caused to my teeth, not exactly the deal of the century with how much dental work costs.\n\nConclusion: It does whiten teeth, and slightly freshen breath, but it doesn't strengthen enamel. If anything, it WEAKENS enamel. Again, it may just be my regimen. Because of the brittle teeth issue, however, I cannot recommend it.\n\n Any comments on how things could have been better are certainly welcome.\n\nUPDATE: I contacted Rembrandt who promptly got back to me, and I spoke with a very kind representative over the phone about the issue. They provided the option to refund my money which I chose, and I'm very impressed by this customer service. Debating bumping this review up to three stars due to their stellar customer service.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I made a set of DIY spiders for Halloween using old lightbulbs and 16 gauge wire. After I wrapped the wire around the neck of the spider, I needed to glue it so they didn't fall off. I probably could have used any glue, but ended up using this since it was what I had on hand. It allowed me to apply a thick layer, which is what I needed, but as it dried, it dripped down (guess I applied it too thick). After it was completely dry, it was sort of a light tan color. That didn't matter much to me though since I was planning to spray paint them black anyway. Overall, I didn't have any flow problem from the bottle, the glue worked because the wire was glued on pretty tightly to the light bulb, and took to painting pretty easily, too. I have a few different Gorilla Glue products and this is definitely one Ill use again. The only thing I would say is don't expect a fast drying time.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I thought about giving this 3 stars but that seemed harsh considering the low cost. I'm not sending this back because it's basically what I was looking for; simple, lightweight, disposable bag, inexpensive but functional. I've  used it exactly once and as other reviews note, it seems to have plenty of power despite other units having larger motors. It did the job. All that is positive. On the down side, the cord is pretty short--about 7-8 ft shorter than the Hoover we just retired so a coiled extension cord will be a permanent fixture. If you have large rooms, be prepared to plug/unplug frequently. Also the cord attaches to the sweeper head, not the top of handle which is awkward. You have to assemble and install the plastic handle which is why they mount the cord directly to the unit but when you pull it back toward you, the cord is frequently in the way. So, you have to do some cord control while you're working. It also has an annoying, high pitched whine/whistle. All vacuums are loud but this is very high pitched--maybe it's just a frequency that's bad for me(?). All that sounds bad but I really think it measures up to what I expected. Franky, we don't vacuum as often as we should, we have no pets, and we use a canister vac for a number of areas. It IS lightweight, so perhaps we will use it more often, being less cumbersome to carry from room to room.", "label": 1}

{"text": "As an owner of an \"original\" Sonicare (on my second actually) I am writing this review more from the perspective of whether the Elite is worth $[$$]+ as an \"upgrade\".\nFirst, from an aesthetic and ergonomic point on view the Elite is a big step forward.  The handle is lighter and has a tapered shape with a rubber grip.  More importantly the brush head is smaller and is more of a diamond shape rather than the \"original\" rectangle.  The brush head \"neck\" is also angled to provide easier access to the back teeth and \"flexes\" both horizontally and vertically.\nThat being said, the Elite just does not seem as \"powerful\" as the original.  This is based not only on my subjective opinion of the \"feel\" while brushing but also on an objective \"look\" at the brush head while powered on.  Whereas the original has bristles that travel through a 90 degree arc, the Elite bristles barely travel at all.  Granted, this may be in part due to the smaller/shorter bristles.  Sonicare claims that the Elite is actually better from a functional point of view and I cannot say otherwise, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  (yes, i tested with the \"beginner mode\" turned off)\nAlso, after six weeks of usage, one of the magnets on the Elite brush head appears to have rusted significantly.  This was never a problem with the \"original\" Sonicare brush heads.  Whether this affects performance or not I cannot say.  As the brush head enters its third, fourth or fifth month of service I can only assume that the changes for decreased performance would increase.  Also, black \"moldy\" appearing deposits accumulate in the handle \"well\" which, also, never occured with the \"original\".  My guess here is that water is allowed to accumulate inside the brush head and handle well because of the flexible rubber housing (between the brush head \"nut\" and \"neck\") allows for the 360 degree \"flex\" I mentioned earlier-this housing is not sealed.  When I inquired, Sonicare denied(not having seen the unit) that what I was seeing was rust, and referred me to the cleaning instructions.  Take that for what it is worth...\nI have found one interesting thing... While the \"original\" brush head will not fit the Elite handle, the Elite brush head WILL fit the \"original\" handle.  I detect no difference in the brushing experience using that combination.\nMy recommendations therefore are:\n1) if you have never had a Sonicare then by all means buy the \"Elite\"... (but be wary of the rusting problem)\n2) if you currently have an \"original\" that is on its last legs then buy an Elite (again be wary of the rust)\n...", "label": 2}
