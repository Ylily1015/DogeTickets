{"text": "Homeowner remodeling.  Bought four of these pump jack systems - set three up and needed two more braces.\n\nI read the reviews before deciding to purchase and saw most of the not-so-good marks related to the 30\" span the brace will provide.  I have no issue with this span.\n\nConcerning the brace, it works as advertised.  However, here are some of the issues I encountered:\n- the metal plates that surround the double 2x4 don't fit exactly.  They are about 1/8 not wide enough.  Luckily the enclosed carriage bolt was long enough to allow me to attach them.\n- had to use a wire brush wheel on the carriage bolt to get the paint off of them.  Would like to see stainless steel provided by the manufacturer and not painted steel.  I will replace mine with SS soon.  Luckily, I have a bench grinder/wheel and removing the paint wasn't difficult.\n- not fond of the 32\" span.  My old house (100+ years) was buitl with 24\" centers (I didn't know they did that yars ago until I tore my house apart).  This was easily resolved by attaching an old 1/4 (7/8 thick) to the 2x4's and then attaching the brace to this, putting a 2x4 block behind the brace for additional screw support.\n- not fond of having a wing nut to hold the carriage bolt.  Doesn't seem like it would be substantial enough, but it is.  I'll replace it with a regular hex nut (with washer and star lock washer) when I change the carriage bolt to stainless.\n- I understand why the supports that attach to the house are vertical, but that didn't do me much good since I wasn't attaching directly to studs.  Easy to work around, however.\n\nMy double 2x4 columns are 24' long - I have the top brace 2\" down from the top because I need to pump the system to the top.  I should have went with 30' columns, but I didn't know this until the 1st column was put into place.  If you run columns this long, plan for two braces unless you feel comfortable with swaying.  I am able to park the system above the lower brace (which are positoned about 8' from the ground) and reach the scaffold via a deck that's next to my work area.\n\nNO CORNER BRACES EXIST!  I searched high and low and cannot find a corner brace - one that will allow me to walk around a corner via a scaffold resting on top of another scaffold.  Simple to design, however, and I will have mine created by a fabrication shop this winter before I set up to put vinyl siding on my house.\n\nOverall, the braces work as advertised and I'd buy them again.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have gone through quite a few tubes for sealing exterior siding and caulking around window and door trim after replacing a lot of windows and 3 exterior doors.\n\nIt goes on easily and fills cracks well because is not too \"stiff\".  However, when the pressure is released, the caulk continues to slowly keep coming out. With a narrow bead, about 3/32\", it can ooze out up to eight inches.  When I stop to reposition the caulk gun, it oozes enough that I have to wipe off the spout because there is too much to caulk accumulated on it to make a clean transition when resuming caulking.\n\nI suspect the continued oozing is a packaging problem such that the pressure is not fully relieved when the caulk gun ram mechanism is completely released.  This makes the job much messier than it should.\n\nI have used both white and almond and they behave the same way.  It sets up fairly quickly, like latex paint, but does remain flexible.\n\nIf you have small defects, such as a depression around a nail head, you can just get some caulk on your finger and smear it over the defect.  It seals it quite well and while leaving a slight depression, it seals much better than filler.\n\nIt does store well.  I just put an electrical wire nut over the spout and screw it on.\n\nIf you have gaps greater than 1/8\", use a backing filler and plan on making a couple of passes with several hours between them.  It is not stiff enough to fill larger gaps.  Don't expect to be able to fill larger gaps so that they are flush - expect a slight depression at the gap.\n\nI have had some exposed to weather for several months without any apparent degradation - it will be painted eventually.\n\nIf it had better workability, I would give it 5 stars.

I find they are stuck together so tightly I can't get them apart.  I drop them on carpet or a door mat.  I'm afraid if I drop them on concrete, the ends could get bunged up.  If I have trouble with the curved parts of the gutter blower, I'll try a rubber mallet.\n\nThere are no more leaves to blow this year so I won't find out if they still blow apart until next year.\n\nMethod 2.  If method 1 fails, I will drill small holes where they overlap and put in some short sheet metal screws.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I thought it was me until I read the other complaints about the Scotch Super Strength Tape not sticking to packages. While this may be a very strong (labeled 20x stronger) packaging tape, it's not much good if it won't stick to the package.\n\nI had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products.", "label": 0}
{"text": "We are doing a kitchen remodel and was excited to see this product for doing the crown molding.  You have 2-3 seconds to get the joint right or it is glued, wish it gave you a little more time.  Some of the joints glued instantly and others never glued together, very frustrating.  When glue held it worked OK for smaller pieces.  However, on pieces that were several feet long I kept breaking the joints; a small fit up error gets large at the end of a long piece so when I tried to bend the joint to close the gap it would ALWAYS break.  Cleaning up the joint takes time and many time ruined the molding.  The only glue that worked for me was the jell, the others never held and ran out of the joint making a mess.  The de-bonder works well but you must be patient since it takes time to debond.  I bought the large spray can for the activator hoping that it would improve joint hold and there was no difference in performance.", "label": 2}

{"text": "The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.\nUnfortunately I could not find a better quality 2\" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Works as advertised, but there are a couple of shortcomings which are related and may not affect many people.\nFirst, the span between the attachment points is 32\" based on the assumption that they will be used with 16\" stud spacing.  Since I was working high on the gable end of my house, I was attaching to the end roof truss which has 24\" spacing between verticals.  My solution was to make an adapter out of a 2x4 which would fit between the brace and the house.\nSecond, the two mounting holes at each attachment point are 3\" apart which means they can't both be used to attach to a horizontal 2x4 (ie: the adapter mentioned above).  I had to drill an aditional hole between the two existing holes on the brace so I could mount each side with two screws.\nSince I pre-drilled the holes on the side of the house, I was able to mount them by myself with no problem.  I was able to hold the brace with one hand and insert the screw with the other while standing on a ladder.  They're not very heavy and since the attachment points swivel, the braces hang down while you're attaching them.  The only part of the job I found intimidating was handling the heavy poles (22 feet long in my case) while standing way up there.\nIt turned out that the 30\" length was fine for my particular job, but they would certainly be more versatile if they were adjustable as mentioned by the other reviewers.", "label": 1}

I had 8 holes I needed to drill out to ~1\" to accommodate a 1/2\" stainless female coupler. I did my best to keep the RPMs and feed rate down as to not work harden the stainless but despite my best efforts, the bit really struggled from 3/4\" on. Part of the problem was maintaining the proper speed and feed with a hand drill but part of the problem was the burr formation on the bit as I used it. This started to happen around hole 5 and was somewhat surprising considering the hardness and price of this bit. Once the burrs formed, hence dulling and generating heat, my speed was no longer the problem due to the bit's inability to cut. The bit really struggled to make the 1\" hole even when new but cut very easily through the stainless for smaller holes.  Perhaps a large drill press would do the trick but this was not practical for my use. If using this bit with stainless, watch your speed and feed and keep it cool as possible and stick to smaller holes. My bit will never cut another hole above 3/4\" which is very disappointing considering the price I paid for it.", "label": 2}

This sandpaper lasts considerably longer, is much, much stronger and you simply cut it to size, stick one layer on the pad of your sander as a base, then add another layer,  clip them in and away you go. Not only that, it makes your pads last 10X longer as well. When it's worn out, remove it (I find it helps to let a few layers of sandpaper build up on the pad). This will save you a fortune in throw away single sheets and OK, it doesn't have any holes in it so you won't be collecting much dust - but then do you really anyway? Saves time, works better and saves a fortune in the long run. Does a much better job too and if you ever need a small piece for hand sanding, simply cut a sheet to the desired size, fold it over and stick it to itself and again, it won't slip, you won't be tearing it or cursing at it, you'll be able to get into those tight corners and the job will be done so much better in half the time!

We have, however, been sorely disappointed by the shelf-life of this product.  Had we known how short the product life is we would not have invested the money into a Sonicare product.  The set with two heads cost over $100.  Every 6 months we bought two replacement heads for over $20.  Three years into using the product, the battery died.  Upon calling the manufacturer, we were informed that the battery life should be 5 to 7 years; the warranty is only 2 years; the battery cannot be replaced and all we can do is throw away our still-functioning base and purchase a brand-new unit.  So beware, if you put your hard-earned dollars into this expensive product, it may only last three years and the manufacturer will not lift a finger to ensure you get the impression that this is just a buy and throw-away product.

{"text": "We've used this glue for a variety of projects but to tell you the truth, it's really not one of our favorites.  We still use it occasionally but it's not our \"go to\" glue if you know what I mean.\n\nIf we're looking for a glue that will fill gaps we'll use.  Otherwise, we'll use something else.\n\nWhat I Like:\n-------------------------\n If you're not concerned about the appearance of the glue joint, it woks pretty well and it expands quite a bit so it can bridge gaps that other types of glues can't.  With other types of glue, if you use to much, it will skim over and only the surface will cure.  The glue that is under the skimmed over film won't usually set up.  This glue is moisture cured and doesn't have this problem.\n\nWhat I Don't Like:\n-------------------------\n It's very messy to work with and if you don't use gloves you're likely to get it on your fingers and it won't wash off with soap and water.\n If you get it anywhere other than the glue joint, post cure cleanup can be difficult.\n When it drys it expands a lot so there is often an extra clean up step once the glue is fully cured.  We often have to trim off any glue that expands out of the glue joint.\n As it cures and expands, the actual cured glue is quite porous.  By that I mean there will be several air bubbles in the cured glue.  At least we have found this to be the case with glue joints that aren't clamped tight during the curing process.", "label": 2}

Unfortunately, with Shop Vacs, you inevidibly, compromise power and performance when you go for the smaller models.\n\nWhat I like about this vacuum:\n\n1. Its lightweight-easy to carry around, especially when cleaning the car. I occasionally use it indoors as well.\n\n2. I've used it a few times. If you clean the filter (or whatever it is that they tell you to empty and clean after each use) as recommended then the vacuum maintains its \"full strength\" power (as time goes by, it does lose strength when you're using it, but thats due to its small \"holding\" capacity-it can't stomach 16 lbs. of debris).\n\n3. Price. Hey I paid ~$30, so I can't expect the performance of an industrial strength commercial cleaner or even my household canister that cost a few hundred bucks. But for the price, its a nice little tool for little jobs.\n\nWhat I don't like about it:\n\n1. It seems to blow a lot of dust around sometimes. But this may have more to do with how you hold it then the product itself. Because when I was cleaning my car, I'd notice sometimes an area that I had just cleaned would be dirty a few minutes later. And I think this was in part due to the how the vacuum was positioned because there is a part of it that vents out air which I think is responsible for blowing around debris and dirtying areas that had just been cleaned. So be mindful of how the vacuum is sitting or how you're holding it and you will be OK.\n\n2. Not a lot of power. But like I said-for $30, I didn't buy this with unrealistic expectations. In fact, I was more impressed with what I got for the price, then anything.\n\n3.

{"text": "Good:  Extremely strong bond.  Versatile over many types of surface applications. I glued the foam back together on a set of Oakley ski goggles two days ago.

Limited shelf life-squeeze the air out each time, and next time I'd probably buy the 4oz version  unless you're using it constantly, because it goes a long way.\n\nBad: Foams a lot for a glue, and has a tendency to squeeze out from tiny cracks under compression.  This means you have to sit and monitor it and wipe off the foam as it comes out.  Silly boy you say, just use less glue....I did!  I had about twenty feet of a finished wood extender to put on our new kitchen cabinets to we could get the crown molding to fit.  By the end, I'd learned to put the glue on towards the back of the piece so it didn't squish out the front, and was using a very thin bead as well.\n\nBottom Line:  If I had two pieces of something to glue together and didn't worry about seeing some glue lines, I'd reach for this.  If I had something I planned on showing a finished face on, I'd use regular wood glue.  Depending on the strength I needed, I might use this, but I'd be very, very careful, otherwise you could wind up with a hard foamy mess on a finished surface.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First: I wanted to like this mouthwash.\n\nMy background: I brush and floss twice a day. I use the Rembrandt Deeply White fresh mint toothpaste and have been using it for the past few years with no problems (see my separate review for the Rembrandt winter mint toothpaste). I do love the Rembrandt toothpaste, it whitens and also does fight cavities, in fact I've only been to the dentist in the past few years due to routine cleaning, nothing more. Needless to say, I had high hopes for the mouthwash.\n\nWhat I expected: I wanted my teeth to be whitened a bit more, mostly. The fresh breath wasn't a big deal, but would be nice. I also liked how there was fluoride in the mouthwash which was claimed to \"strengthen enamel.\"\n\nWhat happened: Yes, it works for whitening teeth. I noticed a difference within a few days. It was pretty impressive. However, due to how my teeth were already quite white, the difference wasn't anything spectacular. Just a nice shade whiter. Those with more yellow teeth, as is the case with most whitening products, are likely to see bigger results. The mouthwash also helps keep my teeth smooth. Freshening my breath? Ehh...it does but really not extremely so. In fact, I'd say that Listerine would probably do a better job if you just wanted fresh breath. It didn't make my teeth sensitive, either. But for strengthening enamel? On to that...\n\nThe ugly: After using the mouthwash for about a month and a half (used it twice a day, two capfuls as prescribed on the label for 1min. exactly), I had two bad experiences. First, when biting down on a somewhat tough bagel, my front tooth came down and chipped off a small piece of one of my bottom teeth. Second, while eating a strawberry, one of the seeds got stuck between my two front teeth where some cosmetic work had been done...it cracked one of my teeth! Not to the point where it caused pain, but there's a crack on the inside and it's now very difficult to floss between my two front teeth. It may be a result of using the Rembrandt toothpaste with the mouthwash and having too much peroxide overall, but the routine made my teeth very brittle. Moreover, Rembrandt does recommend using their own Deeply White toothpaste in tandem with this mouthwash. Funny enough, I was particularly keen to try this mouthwash as there is no alcohol in it, but it seems to have not mattered much. I have no idea how much peroxide is actually in this stuff, perhaps it's too much. So I ended up with a chipped tooth and a cracked tooth within a week of each other. That's when I stopped using the mouthwash. Keep in mind I've never chipped or cracked a tooth before this.\n\nAfterthoughts: My teeth were already quite white to begin with and I just wanted to get them a bit nicer. Yes, the product made them a bit whiter. But it also made my teeth more brittle. I do bleach my teeth using professional grade gel, but that is once every half a year, and the last time I bleached was months ago, so I doubt that had much to do with it.\n\nThe price: isn't killer, just $5 a bottle here on amazon and free super saver shipping. Considering the damage it caused to my teeth, not exactly the deal of the century with how much dental work costs.\n\nConclusion: It does whiten teeth, and slightly freshen breath, but it doesn't strengthen enamel. If anything, it WEAKENS enamel. Again, it may just be my regimen. Because of the brittle teeth issue, however, I cannot recommend it.\n\n Any comments on how things could have been better are certainly welcome.\n\nUPDATE: I contacted Rembrandt who promptly got back to me, and I spoke with a very kind representative over the phone about the issue. They provided the option to refund my money which I chose, and I'm very impressed by this customer service. Debating bumping this review up to three stars due to their stellar customer service.", "label": 0}

I probably could have used any glue, but ended up using this since it was what I had on hand. It allowed me to apply a thick layer, which is what I needed, but as it dried, it dripped down (guess I applied it too thick). After it was completely dry, it was sort of a light tan color. That didn't matter much to me though since I was planning to spray paint them black anyway. Overall, I didn't have any flow problem from the bottle, the glue worked because the wire was glued on pretty tightly to the light bulb, and took to painting pretty easily, too.

I'm not sending this back because it's basically what I was looking for; simple, lightweight, disposable bag, inexpensive but functional. I've  used it exactly once and as other reviews note, it seems to have plenty of power despite other units having larger motors. It did the job. All that is positive. On the down side, the cord is pretty short--about 7-8 ft shorter than the Hoover we just retired so a coiled extension cord will be a permanent fixture. If you have large rooms, be prepared to plug/unplug frequently. Also the cord attaches to the sweeper head, not the top of handle which is awkward. You have to assemble and install the plastic handle which is why they mount the cord directly to the unit but when you pull it back toward you, the cord is frequently in the way. So, you have to do some cord control while you're working. It also has an annoying, high pitched whine/whistle. All vacuums are loud but this is very high pitched--maybe it's just a frequency that's bad for me(?). All that sounds bad but I really think it measures up to what I expected. Franky, we don't vacuum as often as we should, we have no pets, and we use a canister vac for a number of areas.

{"text": "As an owner of an \"original\" Sonicare (on my second actually) I am writing this review more from the perspective of whether the Elite is worth $[$$]+ as an \"upgrade\".\nFirst, from an aesthetic and ergonomic point on view the Elite is a big step forward.  The handle is lighter and has a tapered shape with a rubber grip.  More importantly the brush head is smaller and is more of a diamond shape rather than the \"original\" rectangle.  The brush head \"neck\" is also angled to provide easier access to the back teeth and \"flexes\" both horizontally and vertically.\nThat being said, the Elite just does not seem as \"powerful\" as the original.  This is based not only on my subjective opinion of the \"feel\" while brushing but also on an objective \"look\" at the brush head while powered on.  Whereas the original has bristles that travel through a 90 degree arc, the Elite bristles barely travel at all.  Granted, this may be in part due to the smaller/shorter bristles.  Sonicare claims that the Elite is actually better from a functional point of view and I cannot say otherwise, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  (yes, i tested with the \"beginner mode\" turned off)\nAlso, after six weeks of usage, one of the magnets on the Elite brush head appears to have rusted significantly.  This was never a problem with the \"original\" Sonicare brush heads.  Whether this affects performance or not I cannot say.  As the brush head enters its third, fourth or fifth month of service I can only assume that the changes for decreased performance would increase.  Also, black \"moldy\" appearing deposits accumulate in the handle \"well\" which, also, never occured with the \"original\".  My guess here is that water is allowed to accumulate inside the brush head and handle well because of the flexible rubber housing (between the brush head \"nut\" and \"neck\") allows for the 360 degree \"flex\" I mentioned earlier-this housing is not sealed.  When I inquired, Sonicare denied(not having seen the unit) that what I was seeing was rust, and referred me to the cleaning instructions.  Take that for what it is worth...\nI have found one interesting thing... While the \"original\" brush head will not fit the Elite handle, the Elite brush head WILL fit the \"original\" handle.  I detect no difference in the brushing experience using that combination.\nMy recommendations therefore are:\n1) if you have never had a Sonicare then by all means buy the \"Elite\"... (but be wary of the rusting problem)\n2) if you currently have an \"original\" that is on its last legs then buy an Elite (again be wary of the rust)\n...", "label": 2}

{"text": "I am 21, not a coffee drinker, smoker or pop drinker.  So needless to say my teeth aren't stained yellow or that yellow to begin with.  The gel stung my gums after the 2nd of 4 rounds of whitening.  After all 4 trays were done I honestly didn't see a difference and my gums still hurt the day after.  I wouldn't recommend this unless your teeth are super yellow then it might do you some good.  But don't expect a beautiful white smile like the commercials.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Disclaimer - used it for a different purpose than most people. I needed a bumper protection for Roomba as it was scratching our beloved furniture. I searched for Roomba protectorand this was the first hit.\n\nThis is not a good use of the product. While it provides good protection, it does not stay on for longer than a day. Given its thickness, it also hampers charging. Would not recommend.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Two of these brushes didn't even work--one wouldn't fit on my toothbrush and the other did something to it so it wouldn't turn on. One broke the first time I used it, the little plastic stabalizer on the back of the head snapped out. The last one was so stiff it hurt to use.", "label": 0}
{"text": "These towels are very useful, no question about that.  This time, I bought this box instead of the normal paper-towel-roll format that I usually buy.  I was thinking it would be like a kleenex box, where each towel comes out individually - thus making it a one-handed operation.  Unfortunately, it is just basically one big roll inside the box and you still have to rip it off.  So much for the one hand...Guess it's back to the small rolls.", "label": 2}

{"text": "I got the 6 1/4\" version, which turned out to be a little large for my purposes. The length is the leg length, not the overall height, and this wasn't clear from the description.\n\nAlso, the points are not as sharp as they could be; I could not pick up the divisions in my steel rule without further sharpening.", "label": 2}
{"text": "VERY PAINFUL!! The price is fine and the 2-hr process is fine and caused very little discomfort. However, when I woke up the following morning my gums and teeth were in a ton of pain. The pain was significant for almost 3 days and eating any food during that time was very painful and difficult.\n\nI am a guy with a fairly high pain threshold. I followed the instructions exactly. The slight whitening from this kit is nowhere close to worth the pain you will have to endure. I will not use this product ever again.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I only ended up doing 3 of the 4 treatments taking the 3rd one off early. My gums were sore so I decided not to continue. The next day I woke up to a severely swollen lip with white and red gums and inside of upper lip. White like how peroxide makes your skin if left on. Two days later and it is still very painful to brush my teeth. I cannot eat anything that needs to be bitten into like a sandwich or apple. Glad I didn't do this days before the wedding. Ill have time to heal up.", "label": 0}

{"text": "These are functional, but not very tough.  They seem to be a little softer than some other brads I have used, which lets them deflect fairly easily at this long length.

{"text": "These would be useful for lighter furniture on tile or carpet and definitely not on wood floors for heavy furniture. The wheels are very small and with a heavy piece of furniture indent the wood floor as it rolls across it. With the wheels being so small it is very difficult to get over any floor separator and you end up having to lift the furniture over trying to get the mini dolly back under the leg on the other side. This dolly is just too small for moving furniture of any size.", "label": 0}
